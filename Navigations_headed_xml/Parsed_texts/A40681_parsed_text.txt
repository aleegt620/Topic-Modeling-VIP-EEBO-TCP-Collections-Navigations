To the Right Honourable
ESME STUART,
Earl of March, and Darneley, Lord Leighton &c.
Son and Heir to the Illustrious
JAMES
Duke of Richmond and Lennox.


MY LORD,


C
Onsulting with my self about a 
Patron
 for
this 
Book,
 I concluded to make choice of
such a Person as should be both of most
noble extraction, and of spotless innocency:
So that in this captious Age, none should presume to charge
him with the least offence in 
thought, word, or deed.
 For
justly fearing too many faults might be found in the book
it self, I desired to make some amends by dedicating it
to One free from all exception.


Your Honour is the first in our Nobility, whom I
finde qualified according to my desire; descended from the


best Houses in 
England, Scotland,
 and 
France.
 And
as it happeneth in a 
Constellation,
 that the 
Lustre
 there∣of,
amounting from many Stars together, darkeneth the 
light

of those particulars, which produced it: So in your 
Honours

Pedegree, the 
collective splendour
 obscureth the 
distinct
brightness
 of those 
severall families
 whence the same re∣sulteth.


Now that your Honour cannot be taxed with any actu∣all
offence, your tender Moneths not as yet compleating a
Year; do sufficiently evidence. Whose innocence is the most
entire Relique of our Primitive integrity; and most per∣fect
pattern of our future felicity. Yea some admiring
what motives to mirth Infants meet with in their silent
and solitary smiles, have resolved (how truely I know not)
that then they converse with 
Angels,
 as indeed such cannot
amongst mortals finde any fitter Companions.


One, or more of these three main Ends are aimed at by
Authors in all ingenuous dedications; Hope to receive pro∣tection;
Desire to derive instruction; and Zeal to express
affection.


For the first, though you cannot by your 
Power,
 yet you may
by your 
Innocence
 be an excellent 
Patron
 to protect our en∣suing
Work. In these civill wars, some have saved themselves
from the sword, with no other shield then bearing a 
Babe
 in
their armes, which rebated their enemies fury into compas∣sion.
So, when some shall be ready to wound our Book with
their censuring Darts, they will be mollified into mercy finding
your innocent Name prefixed in the Front thereof.


As for 
deriving instruction,
 I confess your Honour as yet
incapable thereof. But seeing Infants clothes are providently


made with the biggest, to which they will grow up in process of
time; why may not books (the clothes of the minde) be pro∣portioned
above their present capacity, in hope they will seaso∣nably
shoot up to the understanding thereof? And untill such
time as your Lordships judgment can reap profit from our 
De∣scriptions

herein, may your eyes but take pleasure in the 
Maps

which here are presented unto you.


But the last, not least consideration in my choice of your
Honour, is my ambition to tender my humble service thereun∣to;
The rather because ESME
 your auspicious Name
promiseth, in my apprehension, some good success, now at the

third return,
 as long since at the 
first imposing
 thereof on
your 
Ancestour.


For 
Esme
 Lord Aulbigney (a place of great priviledges in
the Province of 
Berry,
 first by the King of 
France
 bestowed
on [and still possessed by] your Family, in reward of their signal
service to that Crown) about two hundred years since proved
the happy reviver of your family almost extinguished for want
of a Heir, and by his virtuous demeanour added much honour
thereunto.


The same Name now returns on your Lordship, who found
your Fathers house in point of posterity in as low a Condition.
Indeed your Grandfather left a numerous off-spring, whom I
may fitly compare to the 
many strings
 of some 
musicall
 Instru∣ment.
But amongst his male-issue (for the rest I pass by as 
si∣lent strings,
 sending no 
sounds
 to posterity, but losing their own

Surnames
 in their matches) One was soon 
fretted
 in pieces with
sickness; Three more, 
cut off
 in these wars; One absent be∣yond
the Seas, and not easily to be 
tuned
 to a married estate; and
the other 
single string
 remaining [
His Grace
 your Father] left


altogether issueless untill your Lordships welcome Nativity.


But O! what melody can Heavens hand make on a 
Mono∣chord?

which since hath sent your Lordship on a good message I
hope, to the 
Honest house of
 LENNOX.


But I grow tedious in a long Letter to a little Lord, and
therefore turn my Pen into Prayers, that Christ would be plea∣sed
to take you 
up into his Armes,
 (whose embraces are the best
swadling-clothes, as to streighten, so to strengthen you in the
growth of Grace) 
to lay
 
his hands upon you and bless you,

that you may 
grow in stature and favour with God and
with Man;
 The daily desire of


YOUR LORDSHIPS
humble Oratour

To the READER.


W
Hen 
Iacob
 had served 
Laban
 full seven years for his daughter

Rachel,
 and now promised himself the possession of what he
had long looked and much laboured for; his hopes were
frustrated by the
 substituting of 
Leah
 in the room of her sister.
And although it may be pleaded that 
Leah
 was not well qualified
and highly meriting in her self, yet still 
Leah
 was not 
Rachel,

and 
Iacob
 remained both deceived and injured thereby.


Many have long patiently waited, that I should now accor∣ding
to my promise set forth an 
Ecclesiasticall History;
 who now may justly com∣plain
that their expectation is abused, finding a Changeling in the place thereof, a
Book of a far different Nature tendered in stead thereof. And should I plead with

Laban
 the Custome of the Countrey, that it is not fashionable 
to
 give the younger
before the first-born;
 should I alledge for my self that this Book, containing matter
of more ancient date, ought to precede the other, yet this, like 
Labans
 answer, will
be taken rather as a 
, then solid satisfaction.


But, Reader, let me plead in my just defence, that if you be pleased to peruse my

 
promise,
 you will finde the same conditionall, and not obligatory, except (besides
other requisites there expressed) Peace be first setled amongst us. And indeed the
subject challengeth the same, seeing 
Truth
 cannot be matched to 
Safety
 in such Rela∣tions,
till 
Peace
 shall first contract them.


Now herein I make my severest 
Creditour
 my sole 
Iudge,
 appealing to him whe∣ther
the Premises be performed. True it is we have no 
Wars
 at this instant, yet we
have 
Rumours of wars;
 and though the former onely doth 
destroy,
 the latter also
doth 
distract.
 Are these 
gloomy dayes already disclouded?
(to use my own expression
in my
 Promise) or rather is it not true in the Scripture phrase, that the
 
clouds return
after rain?
 Indeed I am sorry that I can say so much in my own defence, and should
account my self happy, if all other 
Breaches
 were made up, and I onely to be punished
for my 
breach of Promise.
 Which, notwithstanding all the difficulties of the subject,
and distractions of our days, I hope in God, in competent time to effect, might but
my endevours meet with a quiet residence, and proportionable incouragement for
such undertakings.


Mean time accept of these my Labours, which by Gods blessing, and the bounty
of my friends are brought into the light: Usefull I hope for the understanding of the
Scriptures. What I have herein performed, I had rather the Reader should tell me
at the end, then I tell him at the beginning of the Book. For the manifold faults
herein, I doubt not but the ingenuous Reader (finding in 
Palestine
e
 
six Cities of
Refuge,
 by Gods own appointment, for the safeguard of such as slew one unawares
without 
malice prepense
) will of his bounty build a 
seventh
 in his own bosome for
my protection, when guilty of unvoluntary mistakes in so great a work. If thou reapest
any profit thereby, give God the glory; To whose providence thou art commit∣ted
by


Thine in Christ Iesus

THE GENERALL DESCRIPTION OF JUDEA.




CHAP. 1. The Designe asserted from causlesse Cavils.


§ 
. 
B
Eing now by Gods assistance to undertake the De∣scription
of 
Iudea,
 my condition appeares not un∣like
to the 
Israelites
 at
 
Kadesh-Barnea,
 who were
much pleased with the report that the Spies
brought of the fruitfulnesse of the Countrey, un∣till
they told them of 
Ahiman, Sheshai
 and 
Talmai,

the three sonnes of 
Anak:
 which quite appaled their courage and dead∣ed
their desire thereof. In the like manner whilest I am invited with se∣verall
pleasing considerations, and delightfull motives, to adventure
on this work, three Giantlike objections, which must be encountred, do
in a manner dishearten me from further proceeding. For some will
lay to my charge, that the description of this Countrey



1 Hath formerly been done by many.


2 Cannot perfectly be done by any.


3 If exactly done, is altogether uselesse, and may be somewhat
superstitious.




§ 2. Yet we fear not,
 by Gods blessing, and the Readers favour, seve∣rally
to enter the lists against them all. For the first: Whereas it is ob∣jected,
that many formerly have performed the same; this cavill is not
planted particularly against my inde
vours, but is levelled against the
industry of all Posterity, in any future designe.
 
Solomon
 saith, 
there is no
new thing under the Sunne.
 Except therefore men were Gods to create
new subjects to write upon, groundlesse is the first exception against us.
It never disheartened S. 
Luke
 to write his Gospell, 
for as much as many had
taken in hand to set it forth before.
 Yea the former endevours of many in
the same matter, argue the merit of the work to be great. For sure


there is some extraordinary worth in that face, which hath had so ma∣ny
Suitors. Wherefore although we cannot with 
Columbus,
 finde out
another world, and bring the first tydings of an unknown Conti∣nent
or Island, by us discovered, yet our labours ought not to be con∣demned
as unprofitable, if setting forth an old subject in a new edition
enlarged and amended. This I dare say, though many have written
discourses without Mappes, and more Mappes without discourses, and

 some both, (yet so that three tribes are joined in one Mappe) none have
formerly in any tongue (much lesse in English) presented us with di∣stinct
Mappes and descriptions together.


§ 3. But in the second place it is objected,
 that certainty in this sub∣ject
is unattainable;
 so that the most studious therein, after they have
travelled the whole day, through many tedious difficultie
, must bee
fain to take their hard lodging at night on a bare uncertainty. The
bowels of the best Mappes are puffed up with the humours of fancy,
and a scepticall windinesse, so that a conjecturall Earthquake shakes the
foundations of the strongest mountains, in the point of their exact si∣tuation.
Such are the irreconcileable differences betwixt Geographers
in their descriptions.


§ 4. For answer:

I could wish that this objection also, lay onely a∣gainst
the work in hand,
 and might not [almost] equally be enforced
against other liberall undertakings: for he that holds a reed in one hand
to mete the Topography, and an houre-glasse in the other to measure
the Chronology of the Scripture, shall meet with as many, if not more
uncertainties, in the latter as the former. And yet the learned pains
of such-as labour therein, justly merit commendation. If all conjectu∣rall
results should be cast out for weeds, few hearbs would be left in
the Gardens of most Arts and Sciences. Saint 
Paul
 hath a passage, 
We
know in part, and prophecy in part;
 which is a good curb for our curiosity:
And the same Apostle hath a precept,
 
Prove all things, hold fast that which
is good;
 which is as good a spurre for our diligence. As for the differen∣ces
betwixt Geographers, they ought not to make us carelesse to follow
any, but carefull to choose the best; except with the fluggards drowzie
fancy, we tune the Alarums to our industry, to be Lullabies to our
lazinesse.


§ 5. In the last place it is objected,
 that the designe, if exactly finished,
amounts but to a difficult trifle,
 hard to doe, uselesse when done. And
who will pity the aking of his teeth, who hath wilfully hurt them,
with cracking that shell, wherein he knew was no kernell? It
matters not to any mans salvation, to know the accurate distance be∣twixt

Iericho
 and 
Ierusalem;
 and he that hath climbed to the top of mount

Libanus,
 is not in respect of his soul, a haires breadth nearer to heaven.
Besides, some conceive they heare 
Palestine
 saying unto them, as 
Samuel

to 
Saul
 endevouring to raise him from his grave,
 
Why hast thou disquieted


me to bring me up?
 Describing this Countrey is but disturbing it, it being
better to let it sleep quietly, intombed in its owne ashes. The rather,
because the
 
New Ierusalem
 is now daily expected to come down, and
these corporall (not to say carnall) studies of this terrestriall 
Canaan,
 be∣gin
to grow out of fashion, with the more knowing sort of Christians.


§ 6. It is answered,
 though these studies are not essentiall to sal
ation,
yet they are ornamentall,
 to accomplish men with knowledge, contri∣buting
much to the true understanding of the History of the Bible. Re∣markable
is that passage of the Apostle, 
Acts 17. 26. And hath made of
one bloud all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath de∣termined
the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation:
 wherein
we may see Divinity the Queen waited on by three of her principall
Ladies of honour, namely, skill in



1 Genealogies, concerning the persons of men and their Pede∣grees,

of one bloud all nations.


2 Chronology, in the exact computation 
of the times afore appointed.


3 Geography, measuring out the limits of severall nations, 
and
the bounds of their habitations.




Our work in hand is a parcell of Geography touching a particular
description of 
Iudea;
 without some competent skill wherein, as the blind

Syrians
 intending to goe to 
Dothan,
 went to 
Samaria;
 so ignorant per∣sons
discoursing of the Scripture, must needs make many absurd, and
dangerous mistakes. Nor can knowledge herein, be more speedily and
truly attained, then by particular description of the tribes, where the
eye will learn more in an hour from a Mappe, then the eare can learn
in a day from discourse.


§ 7. But this last objection being forked,
 hath the sharper point there∣of
still behinde, challenging this our subject to be guilty of superstition.
A sinne always detestable to God, but now adayes grown odious to
man. And well it were if the edge of their Zeal were equally whetted
against Profanenesse. Sure if this our work were faulty in this kind, I
my self would send it the same way with the 
Ephesian
 conjuring bookes.

Not all the water of 
Kishon,
 of 
Iordan,
 of the 
Red,
 of the 
Dead,
 of the 
Middle-Land
Sea,
 described in these Maps, should serve to quench the fire,
but all should be burnt to ashes. But no such haste I hope, to condemn
this innocent book, wherein studiously we have abstained from all
such pictures as come within the bounds of danger, yea borders of
offence, and have onely made choice of those, which the most precise
approve usefull for the illustration of Scripture.








CHAP. 2. The different names and bounds of Judea.


§ 1. THis Country which we now come to describe,
 was successive∣ly
called by severall names.




1 The 
Land
 of 
Canaan,
 from the sons of 
Canaan
 that first posses∣sed
it.


2 The 
Land of Promise,
 which name after four hundred and odde
years honourably ended, and was swallowed up in performance.


3 The 
Land of Iudah and Israel,
 consisting of these two Kingdomes.


4 
Iudea,
 so called of 
Iudah
 the most puissant Tribe of the twelve.


5 
Palestine
 (from the 
Philistines.
)
 
Herodotus
 being the first Author,
which I find so tearming it, and all Greeks and Latins after him.


6 The 
Holy Land,
 because our Saviours Passion was acted thereon.
But fear makes me refrain from using this word, lest whilest
I call the Land 
holy,
 this Age count me superstitious.




§ 2. In bounding this Land,
 a necessary distinction must be premised,
the neglecting (or at least not observing) whereof hath engaged many in
inextricable difficulties.


Cannan was twofold, 


1. The 
Larger.


2. The 
Lesser.




The Larger is described Deut. 11. 24. 
Every place whereon the soles of
your feet shall tread, shall be yours: from the wildernesse, and Lebanon, from the

 river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea, shall your coast be.
 This
Land in full latitude was never peaceably possessed by the 
Iews
 as pro∣per
owners thereof any considerable time. Say not, God fell short of
his promise. Oh no: the 
Iews
 fell short of his precepts, who being
narrow hearted in piety, and 
straitned in their own bowels,
 contracted their
soil by their sinnes; and obstructed the bounty of God intended unto
them, by their ingratitude. For the Promise ran onely conditionally,

If ye shall hearken diligently to my
 Commandements.
 And had not Gods mer∣cy
to them been more then their obedience to him, their country
had been narrowed to nothing, and shrunk to an indivisible 
punctum:

or at the best and biggest had been but a prison, fit for the punishment
of so rebellious a people.


§ 3. And yet in somemanner in a qualifyed sense,
 we may observe the

Iews
 did stretch their dominion to the bounds aforesaid in a double con∣sideration.




1 
By victorious Salleys and Incursions. Thus the Children of

Reuben 
having
 conquered the
 Hagarites, inhabited east-ward unto the
entring in of the wildernesse, from the river
 Euphrates.


2 
Per Gentes in amicitiam receptas.
 By the nations which by amicable
compliance (though having absolute command in themselves)


accepted of the Jewish King to be honourary feodaries unto
him. Thus where
 
David
 took some Kings by conquest, as his
Vassals, more took him by composition as their Protectour.
And it is plainly said of
 
Solomon
 that he had 
Dominion over all the
region on this side the river from Tip
sa
 even to Azzah, over all the
Kings on this side the river: and 
e had peace 
 all sides round about.




See we here an Essay of Gods goodnesse made to the 
Israelites.
 That
froward people worshipped him by fits and girds, 
starting aside like a
broken bow:
 and therefore God to admonish them of the unconstancy of
their service, vouchsafed onely to the 
 a cursory and unsetled
Tent
dwelling to 
Euphrates.
 Whereas, had that people solidly and serious∣ly
set themselves constantly to serve God; no doubt, their Incursions
had been turned into fixed Habitations, and the whole Nation (not one∣ly
by the Synecdoche of this one tribe) had pea
ably possessed the large
limits allotted unto them. And whereas now onely 
David
 and 
Solomon

(whom I may more fitly style 
Emperours
 then Kings of this 
larger Canaan
)
rather commanded then possessed to 
Eupbrates,
 God, no doubt, had ex∣tended
their full Dominions to the same dimensions.


§ 4. But the 
lesser Canaan
 was contented with na
rower bounds,
 con∣taining
onely those Nations which God had designed for utter destru∣ction,
and is described, Gen. 10. 19. 
,
and Admah, and Zebojim, even unto 
.
 And whereas in the 
lar∣ger
Canaan,
 when the Israelites besieged any City, God
 commanded them
to pro
fer peace, before they proclaimed war against it, in this 
lesser Cana∣an,

they were finally to root
 them out. And where God commands
men to destroy people, (but first let us be sure that God commands us
to destroy them) the foulest quarter is too fair for them, and those have
not lesse pity, but more piety, which 
 their 
tter destruction:
as the 
Iews
 were to serve the Inhabita
s of this 
lesser Cana
n,
 with∣out
any ceremony of peace once tendred unto them.


§ 5. This 
lesser Canaan
 extended from the wildernesse in the South to
mount 
Lebanon
 in the North,
 and from 
Iordan
 on the East, to the 
Mid∣land
Sea
 on the West. The length thereof sixteen hundred furlongs
(so far the bloud ran out of the wine-presse, 
Revel.
 14. 20.) which,
allowing ten furlongs to the mile, according to the Eastern account,
(whereof largely hereafter) amounts to an hundred and threescore
miles. The breadth thereof generally fifty; to which if the kingdome
of 
Sihon
 and 
Og
 be added on the other side 
Iordan
 (parcels of 
Canaan
the larger,
 and possessed by 
Re
ben, Gad
 and 
half Manasses
) it will make
up the breadth to eighty miles.


§ 6. Having thus a
igned the small bounds of 
Canaan,
 some perchance
will place their scorn, where they ought to plant their wonder; and
will beginne to contemn, what they should justly admire: because


all 
Canaan
 seems but one
 
Zoar; Is it not a little one?
 Yea, some proud
Geographer will scarce stoop to take up so small a 
Ragge of land
 into
his consideration. But let such know, that extracted Spirits, and Elix∣ars
are small in bulk in comparison of great and grosse bodies; and
the land may passe for the quintessence of fruitfulnesse it self. So that
what it lacked in length and breadth, it had in depth, as if nature had
heaped one acre upon another in the matchlesse
 fertility thereof. Our
age barren in beliefe, affords not faith so easily to the story, as this land
afforded food to
 thirteen hundred thousand men, besides women,
children, impotent persons, and all the
 
Levites
 and 
Benjamites
 left un∣numbred.
In generall, it is charactered to be a countrey 
flowing with
milk and honey,
 that is, having plenty of all things both for necessity
and delight.


§ 7. More particularly it is described by
 
Moses,
 A good land, a land of
brookes of water, of fountaines and depths that spring out of vallies and hills, a land
of wheat and barly, and vines and figtrees, and pomegranates: a land of oile-olive
and honey; a land wherein thou shalt eate bread without scarceness, thou shalt not
lacke any thing in it: a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou maist
digge brasse.
 For the further clearing of which description, we will ex∣actly
observe the severall commodities of 
Canaan,
 which nature boun∣tifully
bestowed upon it. Onely the land seems unhappy herein, that
the fruitfulnesse thereof must come under our barren style to describe it.
And yet on second thoughts I perceive, lean pens are fittest to describe
fat Count
es. The soile of the county of 
Armagh
 in 
Ireland
 is so rank
of it selfe, that if any compost or artificiall improvement be added un∣to
it, it turns barren out of sullennesse, and
 indignation, that men
should suspect the native fruitfulnesse thereof: and 
Fat upon Fat
 is false
Heraldry in husbandry. Lest in like manner we should offend this
Country of 
Cannan
 with additionall ornaments of Rhetorique, and lest
all 
lourishes of Eloquence be misinterpreted distrusts of the reall worth
of this Country, a plain style and simple relation best becomes our pre∣sent

§ 1. SHips when sailing are generally conceived to have one moity of
them invisible under water,
 and some countries in like manner
are counted to have their wealth equally within the earth as upon it.
But the proportion holds not exactly in 
Canaan;
 whose visible wealth
farre transcended her concealed substance, and yet we finde some mi∣nerals
therein of considerable value.


§ 2. First, 
Salt,
 so necessary in it self, that without it neither sustenance


is 
avoury to man, nor
 Sacrifice acceptable 
to God.
 Yet had not the

Iews
 more use, then plenty thereof. It seems it was a very cheap commo∣dity,
when 
Abimelech
 (not hoping to reap any harvest thereby) sowed
the city of 
Sech
m
 with
 falt. This was of two sorts in 
Iudea▪ sal fossilis,

which was digged out of the earth, whereof great store about the 
dead,

otherwise called the 
Salt Sea,
 and 
sal coctilis,
 which was boiled out of
water, at
 
Mizrepoth-maiim
 neare 
Zidon.


§ 3. Secondly, materials of 
Glasse,
 whereof the best in the world, al∣most
to the purity of crystall, is found in the
 
Cendevian
 lake, and river

Belus,
 whereof largely hereafter in the tribe of 
Asher.
 And yet we read
not in Scripture that the 
Iews
 ever used glasse for drinking vessels, either
because the invention of them was not so ancient, or because of the
plenty of cups they had of purer metall. We in 
England
 know that
glasses are but the 
seconds,
 which succeed on the 
Cupboard,
 when Plate the
principall is otherwise disposed of.


§ 4. 
Brimsto
e.
 How usefull this is in Physique and fire-works I need
not relate. It is one of the parents of most metals and inclined the wa∣ters
of 
Iudea
 to be soveraign Bathes, and have other medicinall quali∣ties.

Marble
 also was digged up in great plenty in mount
 
Lebanon,
 con∣ducing
much to the adorning of Gods temple and many princely pala∣ces
in 
Ierusalem. Precious stones
 they had none, except 
Lapis Iudaicus
 be
counted for one, commended by 
Galen,
 and is prescribed as excellent
to cure the Stone. Where by the way it will not be amisse to observe,
that amongst the many maladies to which the 
Iews
 bodies were sub∣ject,
I finde not the Stone mentioned in Scripture, though I dare not a∣scribe
it to the plenty of this stone, as a preservative against it.


§ 5. 
Brasse and
 Iron
 abounded in this Country.
 
Moses
 blesseth 
Asher,
Thy shooes shall be Iron and Brasse,
 prognosticating the plenty of those me∣tals
in that tribe. If any except, that brasse is no originall, but a com∣pound
metall of Copper and other ingredients; the answer is easie, by
a frequent and familiar Metonymie, it being put for the materials where∣of
it was composed.


§ 6. As for the two principall metals, 
Iudea
 may say of them as Saint

 
Peter
 to the Cripple, Gold and silver have I none. And it will be no
lesse pleasant, then profitable to recount the reasons thereof.




1 These metals are generally granted by nature in compensati∣on
to barren countries. Now whereas 
Iudea
 had plenty of o∣ther
commodities, it was too much that 
Leahs
 fruitfulnesse
should shine with 
Rahels
 fairenesse, and glister with the lustre of
gold and silver.


2 God would have his people
 
look to the hills, from whence their help
cometh:
 To lay up their treasure in heaven, where rust and moth doe not
corrupt: sursum corda, sursum oculos,
 and not that their eyes by a re∣trograde
motion should be peeping and poring on the earth,


where the treasures concealed, are by Poets consigned to 
Pluto

King of hell: and modern authors avouch, that malignant
Spirits haunt the places, where these metals are found. As if the
Devill did there sit abrood to hatch them, cunningly pretending
an unwillingnesse to part with them; whereas indeed he gains
more by one mine minted out into money, then by a thousand
concealed in the earth.


3 Because it stands not with the State of a Prince to be his own
purse-bearer. God would not have this 
Lordly land of Canaan
 to be
incumbred with carrying such a burden. Let 
Ophir,
 and 
Tarshish,

and 
Havilah
 have the place of 
Iudas,
 to beare the bagge for 
Iudea.


4 Because there might be left unto the 
Gentiles
 an opportunity to
gratifie the 
Iews,
 and to testifie their duty and service to God and
his Temple.
 
The Kings of Tarshish and of the Isles shall bring pre∣sents,
the Kings of Sheba and Seba shall bring gifts.
 Now these nati∣tions
would have been wholly disheartened if they could have
brought 
Iudea
 no novelty, and onely presented her with such
things, whereof she had plenty before.




And yet whosoever shall observe the
 abundance of gold and silver in

Solomons
 time in the city of 
Ierusalem,
 will conclude this Country not to be
the cistern, but fountain of those metals. As if divine providence had so di∣vided
it, that other lands should be at the care & cost to bear, dig out and
refine, and 
Iudea
 have the honour and credit, to use, expend, yea neglect,
such glittering need-nots to humane happinesse. More minerals no
doubt were in the land of 
Iudea,
 and let not either our ignorance, or the

Iews
 idlenesse be interpreted the lands barrennesse, the upper fruitfulnesse
of whose soil made them the more negligent in digging into the bowels
thereof as those need not to play beneath board, who have all the visible
game in their own hands?






CHAP. 4. Of the wealth accruing to Judea from the vegetables therein.


§ 1. AMongst the native and proper commodities of 
Iudea, Balm,

or 
Balsam
 most justly challengeth the principall place. For
when 
Iacob
 advised his sonnes to provide a present for 
Ioseph, Take
 (saith
he) 
of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, a little
 balme, and a little honey,
spices &c.
 Hereby appears the improbable error of such as report how
amongst other rich presents the 
Queen of Sheba
 brought to 
Solomon,
 the
first plants of 
Balsam,
 which afterwards grew in 
Iudea.
 Whereas in∣deed
her bringing of those into that Countrey, had been no better then
carring of water to the fountain.


§ 2. Heare the judgment of Pagan writers altogether unconcerned



in this businesse.
 
Pliny
 saith, 
Balsamum uni terrarum Iudaeae concessum,
 un∣derstanding
that 
Iudea
 alone was the Primitive place where it grew,
though afterwards colonies thereof were transplanted into 
Egypt
 and
other countries. With him agreeth 
Theophrastus, Dioscorides and
 Galen,

who professeth that he went on purpose to 
Iudea,
 to observe the distilling
thereof, and carried a small portion of balm about him, by comparing
thereof to discover and confute the frequent impostures of such as coun∣terfeit
the same. This 
Balsame
 was principally twofold.




1 
Xulo-balsamum,
 being the parent, namely the shrub, (or in com∣plement
call it the tree) out of which it proceeded.


2 
Opo-balsamum,
 being
the daughter, which
trickled like teares from the former, usefull for men



Sound, making a most odoriferous and
pleasant perfume;


Sick, being a soveraign salve for their
wounds;


Dead,
being an admirable preservative a∣gainst
corruption. So that their
embalmed bodies seem'd in
some sort to typifie the 
eternity

of their soule.






§ 3. But this Balm was not so fixed to 
Gilead
 or any other part of

Iudea,
 but that it was moveable thence upon the sinnes of the people.
For after some flittings of this plant to 
Iericho
 (whereof afterwards) it
was first by 
Pompey,
 and finally by 
Vespasian
 carried captive to 
Rome.

Where it thrived so well that it was never (saith
 
Pliny) fairer
 or fruitful∣ler.
Which passage may serve as a parable, whereof our Saviour him∣self
is the sense. Who being formerly confined to 
Palestine
 alone, did
afterwards effectually extend himself for the good of all nations. But
enough hereof, if not too much. Yet seeing the reader, if being to fill
his viall with this precious liquor, would not complain of overmuch
measure, I trust he will not be displeased with our larger description
thereof.


§ 4.
 
Oil-olive,
 so called to difference it both from 
seed,
 and 
train-oile.

Hereof three kindes, or rather degrees. The coursest imploied for
lamps; a finer sort used for meat, and the most refined of all com∣pounded
with various spices; whereof ointment was made, where∣with
great Persons on solemn festivals used to anoint themselves, and
upon other occasions, many others.


§ 5. 
Honey.
 This was the 
Sugar,
 as 
Salt
 was the 
Pepper
 of the anci∣ents.
And although 
Sugar canes
 grew in 
Iudea
 (whereof some conside∣rable
store at this day) yet the use thereof was either unknown to, or
neglected by the 
Iews
 in Scripture, preferring honey in their daily diet.
And it may seem strange, that honey being so delici
us in taste, and a
staple commodity in 
Canaan,
 was
 forbidden to be used in any sacrifice.
Learned men trouble themselves about the reason of this prohibition.


Some conceive voluptuousnesse thereby is forbidden; others, lip-lu∣sciousnesse
and hypocrisie in divine service; others, pride and ambi∣tion;
(because honey turnes into choler)

others, that it is forbidden in
opposition to the 
Persian sacrifices,
 wherein honey was principally offer∣ed.
And whereas the varieties of fancies herein are infinite, some sober∣ly
rest themselves on no other reason; but divine pleasure. As for 
Wax,

the cask of honey, it was used the lesse for lights, because lamps were
so much in fashion.


§ 6. 
Wheat.
 They are called the
 
Kidneys of wheat,
 because the grains
therein were so plump and swelling, as if all out of 
Pharaohs seven full
eares.
 Yea our modern Merchants will tell you (provided they be first
out of the Turkish dominions; otherwise it is death to be caught 
in the
manner
) that even at this day they carry much wheat out of 
Palestine
 into

Italy
 it self. Say not, wheat was not so plentifull in this Countrey, be∣cause
our Saviours constant fare was on barly loaves: this argues the
humility of Christ, not the barrenness of the Countrey; otherwise by
the same consequence it might be inferred, that there were no houses
in 
Iudea,
 because he wanted 
where to lay his head.
 These four aforesaid
were the elementall Commodities of 
Canaan,
 whereof that Countrey
had not onely a self-sufficiency, but also sent plenty thereof to
 
Tyre,

thence to the whole world. 
Iudah and the land of Israel they were thy Mer∣chants,
they traded in the market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and Honey, and
Oil, and Balm.


§ 7. 
Wine
 may follow in the next place, whereof such plenty, that

Iacob
 prophecyed of 
Iudah,
 that he should 
binde his foal unto the vine, and
his asses colt unto the choice vine &c.
 That is, having occasion to dismount
his Asse, and tye him for a time, vines should offer themselves as most
obvious to fasten him unto; and those so great (Adjectives in other
Countreys, but Substantives here) that he might safely tye his beast to

them, which
 with us are tyed to other trees for their support. Nor were
their grapes less good then great, as a
 Poet (the most competent Judg
of the matter in hand) doth bear witness,




Vina mihi non sunt Gazetica, Chia, Falerna,


Quaeque Sareptano palmite missa bibas.






I have no 
Gaza, Chios, Falern
 wine,


Nor any flowing from 
Sarepta's
 vine.




Thus making a quadripartite division of good wine, two members
thereof, that of 
Gaza
 and 
Sarepta,
 the one falls in the tribe of 
Simeon,
 the
other of 
Asher,
 both in the countrey of 
Palestine.


§ 8.
 
Flax.
 Hereof great plenty. And pity it was so good a commo∣dity
should be prostituted to idolatry, which caused God to threaten
that he would 
rescue and recover his
 flax againe.
 The Jewish women were
excellent
 houswives, and hereof made great profit, venting it into
forein parts.



§ 9. Wood of all sorts; so that 
Palestine
 was a continued grove of
trees, covered over with streight 
Cedars,
 strong 
Oakes,
 shady 
Palmes,

sweet 
Firres
 &c. If the body of 
Hercules
 may be guessed from his foot,
take the 
Mustard,
 the little Toe of trees, into consideration, and thence
collect the vast proportion of great woods. Some perchance may
count it a Rabbinicall vaunt what
 one writes: 
A certain man of Sichem had
bequeathed by his Father three boughs of Mustard, one of which was broken off from
the rest, and it yeelded nine Kabs of seed, and the wood thereof was sufficient to co∣ver
over the Potters house.
 One may also suspect an Hyperbole in what
 a∣nother
saith, 
I had a stemme of mustard in my garden, into which I could climbe as
into a Figtree.
 However, our
 Saviours words of the extraordinary
growth of this plant must needs be true; and by the same proportion
(surely the 
Iews
 had not more sawce then meat) other trees must be
allowed to be of unusuall greatness.


§ 10. Here I omit to speak of the 
Dates, Almonds, Nuts,
 (at this day
called 
Pistachioes,
 and most cordiall in Physick) 
Figs, Pomegranates
 and
other severall fruits, whose particular description I passe by on purpose,
lest our book should light on some hungry man or longing woman
to read, whose appetites I may unhappily raise, but cannot satisfie again.
And to leave a good sent behind at the close of the chapter, we must not
forget the great store of Frankincense, Myrrh, and other
 Spices which
were plentifully afforded in 
Palestine.






CHAP. 5. Of the store of beasts for food, service, and pleasure in Palestine.


§ 1. WE step now a stair higher from vegetable to sensible crea∣tures:
wherein this countrey was no lesse happy, such was
the variety it afforded therein. Which will appear, first, if we furnish
forth a feast of the flesh, fish, and fowl in 
Palestine;
 these particulars be∣ing
premised. First, that no exception be taken at our false ranking of
dishes. The Apostles said, it was not their office to
 
serve tables,
 and
such mistakes are none at all in Divines Secondly, we name onely solid
and substantiall meat, whereon a cunning Cook (besides sawces and
sallets) may with compounded and forced dishes descant to indefinite∣nesse.
Lastly, know the 
Law
 forbad the 
Iews
 the feeding on severall
meats, so that their life was a Lent, to abstain from such food, to
which Christianity allows us a 
licence:
 Hogges-flesh, Conies, Hares,
Swans, Herons, Lapwings, all fishes in armour, fenced with shels,
 recoun∣ted
amongst the dainties of our diet, were prohibited unto
them. Which very prohibition speakes their plenty in that country,
otherwise the law had been needless to forbid such things which the
land did not afford.



§ 2. Fetching 
Salt, Bread
 and 
Wine
 from the former chapter, (all of the

Quorum
 to every feast) first 
Veale
 is brought in, (food for Angels when

 
Sarah
 dressed it) 
Beef of the bulls of Basan,
 or if that be too course, of
the 
stalled
 Oxen; Lamb, Mutton
 and 
Kid,
 savoury meat, if
 
Rebecca
 have
the cooking thereof; 
Venison
 both 
red
 and 
fallow,
 for so we find in 
Solo∣mons
bill of fare,
 Harts, Bucks
 and 
Bugles.


§ 3. Fowl of all sorts follow, 
Hennes,
 and
 
Chickens. Capons
 I dare
promise none, as uncertain whether mutilating of birds was then in
fashion, to make them barren, that mans luxury might fructifie the
more upon them. Next plenty of
 
Pigeons,
 the poor mans lambs; For
such as could not goe to the cost of the one, was to provide the other for
a sacrifice.
 
Quails
 in abundance; for though their plenty in the wilder∣nesse
was miraculous, when a cloud of them tendred themselves to be
taken by the hands of the 
Israelites,
 yet ordinarily there was store of them
in 
Palestine.
 Let 
Locusts
 for their wings sake be ranked amongst the
fowl, onely to fill up an empty place of the table, for otherwise none
but the stomach of the mortified
 
Baptist
 would feed on so course
a fare.


§ 4. 
Fishes
 come in the next place, whose severall sorts in Sea, Rivers,
and lakes were so many, that onely 
Adam,
 whose memory was the No∣menclator
of the names of all creatures by him imposed, can summon
them by their proper denominations. Of these all that had
 
Finnes
 and

scales
 were permitted the 
Iews
 to eat. Butter the sawce-generall to fish,
must not be forgotten. A staple dish of our Saviours whilest an infant,

 
Butter and honey shall he eat. Cheese
 concludes all; such as
 
David
 brought
to his brethren, such as
 
Barzillai
 provided for 
David.
 Let not any dain∣ty
dairy women object, that Jewish cheese must needs be course, where
milke of
 sheep and
 goats was so much in use: For a mixture of
such milk is in 
Parmizan
 it self, so delicious to the palat. And now
for Grace before and after meat, might not 
Palestine
 thankfully say with

 
David, Thou dost prepare a table before me in the sight of mine adversaries, thou
dost anoint mine head with oil, and my cup runneth over?
 Yea, what is said of
the earth in generall, is most properly applyable to this Country, 
O Lord
how
 manifold are thy works! in wisdome hast thou made them all, the earth is full
of thy riches.


§ 5. Besides cattell for food, there were others for labour, 
Asses, Mules,
Camels, Dromedaries,
 whereof in due place. Birds also and beasts of prey,

Eagles, Hawkes, Lions, Beares, Boares &c.
 Some will say this was a mis∣chief
in 
Palestine,
 whose inhabitants might be said to dwell daily like

Daniel
 in the Lions den, such the store of ravenous beasts freely roaving
up and down the countrey. But let such know, that by these beasts conti∣nued
of purpose, God kept his people in an awfull dependence upon
him; whilest they feared God, these beasts
 dreaded them; and mans
piety muzled up the mouth of these ravenous creatures. Otherwise


when these 
Iews
 rebelled against their Master, the beasts (one of Gods

 four sore judgments) were let loose, and became the just executioners
of divine vengeance on a wicked nation. To conclude, such the variety
of cattell herein, that from hence 
Noah
 might have fraught his Ark
with a couple of most creatures, some few onely excepted (useless for
mankind, save for rarity and fancy) as 
Apes
 and 
Peacocks,
 (perchance ra∣ther

Parrats
) which 
Solomons
 navie
 fetched in, and supplied from 
Tarshish.






CHAP. 6. Objections against the fruitfulnesse of Judea answered.


BUt seeing we live in so unbeleeving an age, that some have brought
the happiness even of heaven it self into question, no wonder if
such as doubt of the truth deny the type, and (though Scripture be po∣sitive
in the point) flatly argue against the fruitfulness of 
Iudea.
 The
first sort of their objections are taken from some passages scattered from
pagan pennes, sleighting 
Iudea
 as an unconsiderable countrey. Thus

 
Strabo
 speaking of 
Moses,
 winning it from the first inhabitants, 
,

easily
 (saith he) 
he obtained it, being a land of which none need be
ambitious, and for which none would studiously engage themselv
 to fight: for it was
a stony countrey.


To which we answer first in generall.
 Heathen writers knew little,
and spake less good of the 
Iews,
 because of the grand distance of Reli∣gions
betwixt them. 
My people
 (saith God) 
are like a
 speckled bird;
 and there∣fore
being of a different feather from other fowl in point of divine wor∣ship,
no wonder if their neighbours flocked about them, to flout at
them, hooting at their strange devotion: though such mocked at by
men for Owles, may be made of by God as Nightingales. Excellent∣ly

Iosephus
 in his book against 
Apion the Grammarian
 doth prove that no
credit is to be given to Pagan reports against the 
Iews.
 And as they lo∣ved
not that people, so they liked not their place, causlesly raising slan∣ders
upon it. More particularly 
Strabo,
 in his rash censure counting 
Iu∣dea

not a prize worth the contending for, is confuted by the course of
history. Let the 
Romans
 (too cunning Merchants to venture on worth∣less
ware) tell how much the City of 
Ierusalem
 cost them, paying an
ounce of bloud for every inch of ground therein.


2 
Object.
 It is said in the Scripture it self, 
Numb.
 13. 23. that 
it was a
land which eateth up the inhabitants thereof.
 It seems it was a very lean, hun∣gry,
and barren land, which in stead of feeding the dwellers therein,
fed upon them.


Answ.
 It is said so indeed, but by whom? 
The false spies whose tongues
were no slander.
 Now (whatsoever they meant by this their expression)


certainly their words intend not any barrennesse in that countrey, ha∣ving
formerly 
(vers.
 27.) confessed the transcendent fertility thereof. Ex∣cept
any will say, that these Spies did now revoke their former witness;
and if so, we look no longer on the land of 
Canaan as devouring her inhabi∣tants,

but on these 
unconstant liers as eating their own words.
 However their
first testimony (when, untampered with by the people, they spake 
their
own sense,
 and gave in their true verdict, of the Land) is to be beleeved,
before their second character of this Countrey, when infected with po∣pular
discontentments, they studied cavills against the same. Besides, if
the meaning of their words, 
[a land eating up the inhabitants thereof]
 be, as
it is generally
 interpreted, 
a land whose inhabitants by civill warres mutually
destroy one another,
 it tends more to the credit, then disgrace of the Coun∣trey.
It is no fault in that rich pasture, if the grasse thereof, be 
Provender
in goodnesse,
 so that the horses fed therein, wax so wanton as to fight one
with another.


3 
Object.
 Water is a staple commodity for mans support, whose life,
lame in it self, soon falls to the ground, if not held up by the 
Staffe of
bread
 in one hand and 
water
 in the other. Now 
Iudea
 had great want
of this Element, a Well being counted such a treasure amongst them,
that great
 strivings have happened about it.


Answ.
 
Iudea
 wanted no water, though dry in comparison of 
England.

We northern nations are ready to suspect the southern parts as afire with
a Feaver; whilest southern Countreys may fear lest our lands be
drowned with a Dropsie; such the superfluity of rain and Rivers a∣mongst
us. Let 
Iudea
 be compared with her neighbours in the same
Climate, and she would be found not onely to equall, but to exceed
them in conveniency of water. The Scripture
 describes it 
a land of brooks
of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills &c.
 And be∣cause
many now adays will beleeve the Maids word before the Mistres∣ses,
I mean, 
humane
 before 
divine
 testimony, hear how
 
Strabo
 speaks to
this point, 
. 
The
Countrey it selfe indeed was well watered, but the coasts about were base and ill wa∣tered.

Besides Rivers 
Iudea
 had constantly (save when the windowes of
heaven were miraculously shut up) the former and the later rain,
which like 
Trade winds
 on some seas, came at set seasons, at Seed-time
and before Harvest. So that heaven may be said to have kept an Ordina∣ry
for 
Iudea,
 and to have fed it at eating hours with set meales of water,
whereas other countreys have no such 
standing Table
 kept for them, be∣ing
left at large to the uncertainty of weather, and not always drinking
when they were athirst, but when they could get moisture.


4 
Object.
 Ammianus

Marcellinus
 reports, that therein were no navigable

ivers, which must needs be a great hindrance of commerce in the
Countrey.


Answ.
 The term 
navigable
 must be distinguished on. Confesse we


that 
Iudea
 had no vast streames in it, like 
Nilus
 or the 
Dan
w,
 whose
chanels are capable of Boats, ships f
llows; yet wanted it not Rivers
to carry vessells of considerable burthens. Every Tribe therein did bor∣der
on the Mid-land sea, or on the river of 
Iordan, up which river, even a∣gainst
the streame,
 they used to sail, in vessells bearing burdens (not un∣like
our western Barges) by the confession of other
 authors.


5. 
Object.
 It was full of mountains, which gener
lly are conceived
destructive to the fruitfulness of a countrey.


Answ.
 Such dwarf-mountains or Giant-hills made the land insensi∣bly
larger in exten
, no whit lesser in increase. Was ever a great belly
brought for an argument of barreness▪ especially seeing these moun∣tains
in 
Iudea
 did not swell with a mock-mother Tympany, but were
pregnant with speciall commodities. Some cattell, as 
Go
tes;
 and plants▪
as 
Vines
 are never more triumphant on their throne, then when advan∣taged
on the sides of such hills. The
 Geographer speaking of 
Trachonitis,

the coursest list, and most craggy ground about the countrey of 
Iudea,

acknowledgeth there were 
, grassie and fair fruitfull
hills; which as they afforded a delightfull prospect, so they conduced much
to make the cities impregnable which were built amongst them.


6. 
Object.
 Mention there is in Scripture of many deserts in 
Iudea,
 as if
the countrey were nothing else but a heap of wildernesses hudled up to∣gether.


Answ.
 Indeed the word 
Desert
 sounds hideously to English eares: it
frights our fancies with the apparitions of a place full of dismall shades,
salvage beasts, and dolefull desolation, whereas in Hebrew it imports
no more then a woody retirednesse from publick habitation; most
of them in extent not exceeding our greater Parks in 
England,
 and more
alluring with the pleasure of privacy, then affrighting with the sadnesse
of solitariness.


7. 
Object.
 Frequent famins are mentioned in this land, and some
most prodigious. In the siege of
 
Samaria
 a woman eat her own child,
unexampled almost in other histories, and all things were sold at exces∣sive
rates.


Answ.
 The instances alledged argue not the barrenness of the coun∣trey,
being extraordinary Punishments inflicted immediately by divine
Justice. This we confesse, that as merry men, when sad, are very sad;
so this pleasant land, when God frowned upon it, was extremely de∣jected,
and the famins therein were famins with a witness.


8. 
Object.
 Saint
 
Hierome,
 who lived himself long in 
Palestine,
 and must
be acknowledged so skilfull in this matter, that others could not deceive
him, & so honest, that he would not deceive others, speaketh very mean∣ly
thereof. 
It is ragged with craggy mountaines, and suffereth the penury of thirst,
so that it preserveth rain water, and supplieth the scarcity of wells by building of
cisterns.




Answ.
 Saint 
Hierome
 in the same place (and none fitter or abler to do
it) answers himself, 
Neque hoc dico in suggillationem terrae Sanctae, sed ut decu∣tiam
supercilium Iudaeorum. &c. I say not this to disgrace the land of Iudea, (as the
hereticall Sycophant doth belie
 me) or to take away the truth of the history, which is
the foundation of spirituall understanding, but to beat down the pride of the Iews,
which enlarge the straits of the Synagogue, further then the breadth of the Church.

This Father did de
ry the literall, to raise the mysticall 
Canaan;
 and they
that know Saint 
Hierome,
 know that when he intends to praise or dis∣praise,
he will doe it to the purpose.

Object.
 Modern travellers which have lately surveyed the countrey,
report it to be a bare surface of sand at this day.


Answ.
 Who can guesse what 
Naomi
 was by what
 
Marah
 is? The
stump indeed stands still, but the branches are withered; the 
Skeleton
 re∣mains,
but the favour and flesh thereof is consumed. 
Iudea
 is, and is
not, what it was before; the same in bulk, not blessing; for fashion,
not fruitfulness; the old Instrument is the same, but it is neither strung
with stock, nor plaid upon with the hand of skilfull husbandry. The

 
Rose of Sharon
 is faded, her 
eaves lost, and now nothing but the pric∣kles
thereof to be seen. See what sinne can doe, or undoe rather, and the
guilt of our Saviours bloud: 
A fruitfull land maketh he barren, for the wicked∣nesse
of them that dwell therein.
 As therefore the cleare and lovely com∣plexions,
the handsome and proper persons, the bold and valiant Spirits,
the comely and courtly behaviour of the ancient 
Iews,
 are not to be mea∣sured
by the suspicious and louring looks, the low and crooked statures,
the slavish and servil conditions, the base and sordid demeanour of the

Iews
 now adays; no more are our judgments to contract the former
fruitfulness of their soil to the present sterility thereof. And yet as the
sheep which fell to
 
Iacobs
 share, had strakes or speckles scattered here
and there in their skins: so, granting the generality of 
Iudea
 barren, yet
by the confession of
 Travellers some spots and parcels of ground tran∣scendently
fruitfull, are every where to be found, retaining and trans∣mitting
to posterity the memory of the universall fruitfulness of 
Iudea,

before God had justly cursed it for the sinnes of the people.






CHAP. 7. Of the ancient division of the land betwixt the seven Canaanitish Nations.


HAving done with the description of the commodities of this
Countrey, we come now to the serverall divisions thereof; which
thing seriously considered conduceth much to the right understanding
of the Scripture. In severall ages the land fell under different divisions.




1 In 
Abrahams
 time it was parted betwixt the seven Nations of

Canaan.



2 Afterwards the same was subdivided into one and thirty petty
Kingdomes.


3 By 
Ioshua
 it was parcelled into twelve portions, betwixt so ma∣ny
tribes.


4 In 
Rehoboams
 reigne it was rent into two kingdomes, 
Iudah
 and

Israel.


5 After the Captivity it was divided into three Provinces, 
Iudea,
Samaria,
 and 
Galile.


6 In Christs and his Apostles time it was carved into four Tetrar∣chies,
and some other appendent dominions.




We will first survey it in the originall condition thereof, as it con∣sisted
of a Heptarchy, or seven ruling nations of 
Canaan,
 whose number,
names, extraction, and severall habitations require much care and dili∣gence
to rank and order them aright.


The first difficulty we meet with, is in the number of these nations, so
variously reckoned up. They are counted up thus: two, 
Gen.
 13. 7.
three, 
Exod.
 23. 28. five, 
Exod.
 13. 5. sixe, 
Exod.
 3. 8. 17. seven, 
Iosh.
 3. 10.
ten, 
Gen.
 15. 19. eleven, 
Gen.
 10. 15. & 1 
Chron.
 1. 13. and seventeen,
if a collective number of them all be cast up. Now how come they to
be so differently computed where one and the same Spirit is the Auditour
to state their account? It is answered, that seven was the compleat and
solemne number, whereon God himself emphatically insists when re∣peating
his favours to the 
Iews,
 Seven nations greater and mighter then thou.

And perchance the beast in the Revelation
 
with seven heads,
 beareth
some allusion thereunto. Wherefore when these seven nations are
summed up defectively, under that number, we must conceive such of
them as are omitted to be implyed under the 
Genericall name
 of 
Cana∣anites.

But on the other side, when above seven are brought, then the
inhabitants of the larger 
Canaan,
 are cast into the account: whose coun∣trey
was promised too, but never peaceably possessed by the 
Israelites,
 as
we observed before. We finde three severall Editions (as I may call
them) of the nations of 
Canaan,
 whereof the most authentick and
common is 
Deut.
 7. 1. which we will principally peruse, as followeth.




1 Hittites.


These come forth first as if it were to usher and make room for the
rest; as well they may, being Giants of such strength and stature, the

Anakims
 being descended from them: so formidable to their foes, that

 some conceive them named from 
 
hittah,
 which signifies 
to scare

and frighten: such the terrible impression of them on their enemies. As
stout their men, so their women were notable domineering dames,
witness 
Rebecca's
 complaint, 
that she was weary of her life for the
 daughters
of Heth
 which 
Esau
 had maried. They lived about 
Hebron
 and 
Beer∣sheba,

and their countrey was afterwards possessed by 
Iudah
 and

Simeon.








2 Girgashites.


It is hard to determin their exact habitation. Wise 
Agur
 confesseth
that 
he knew not the way of a
 
Serpent upon a stone,
 so invisibly he slides
away on a smooth place. Such the clear conveyances of the 
Girga∣shites

going into 
Africa,
 as the 
Iews
 will have it, after 
Ioshua's,
 time▪ that
they cannot be traced by any memory left behind: except some reliques
of them remain in the countrey of the 
Gergesens
 (whose swine the de∣vills

 drawned by Christs permission:) whence
 Authors collect
them to have lived on the east of 
Iordan
 near the Sea of 
Cinnereth,
 after∣wards
in the juncture of the tribes of 
Gad
 and 
Manasseh.






3 Amorites.


These sometimes are taken by a 
Synecdoche
 of eminency for all the
seven nations: 
The sins of the
 Amorites are not yet full.
 Here we behold them
as a particular people, so called, as
 some conceive, from 
 
Amar, to
speak,
 as confident talkers, such as the
 Psalmist describes, 
We ought to
speak, who is Lord over us?
 Yea some carnall cause they had to boast,
being compared by the
 Prophet to 
Cedars
 for their height, and 
Oakes

for their strength. Their originall habitation was in the mountainous
Countrey, which fell afterwards to the lot of
 
Dan,
 and the west part
of the possession of
 
Ephraim.
 Hence they made a 
ally over 
Iordan,
 and
setled themselves under 
Sihon
 their King eastward in the countreys
which they had gained from 
Moab
 and 
Ammon,
 afterwards possessed by

Reuben
 and 
Gad.






4 Canaanites.


These also generally taken include all the seven nations, growing
from the root of 
Canaan.
 Consider we them here as one branch of that
tree. Now though the false report of the spies was in some respect but
a libell of this land, yet they may be beleeved for the situation of the
people therein, that 
the Canaanites dwelt by the
 Sea, and the coast of Iordan,

that is, all the breadth of the Countrey northward, which came after∣wards
to be possessed by 
Asher, Nephthali, Zebulun,
 and 
Issachar.






5 Perizzites.


By interpretation 
Villagers,
 as dwelling in dorps and Hamlets, not
walled towns. Which as it abated their civility, so it advanced their
manhood. Their habitation not far from
 
Bethel,
 where the children
of 
Ioseph
 afterwards received their portion; whose land by
 
Ioshua
 was be∣stowed
upon them, in case the country allotted proved too little for them.

 Some of them also were dispersed in the northern part of the Tribe of

Iudah.






6 Hivites.


Their name in Hebrew signifieth 
Serpents.
 So called, as the learned
conceive, from their delight to live under-ground in caves, whereof
plenty in the sides of mountains. I find two Colonies or plantations of
the 
Hivites.
 One in the center of the land, where afterwards the tribes
of 
Benjamin,
 and 
Ioseph
 met together. For the 
Gibeonites
 (who put a new


cheat on the 
Israelites,
 with their old clothes) were
 
Hivites,
 as also the
inhabitants of 
Sichem
 were of the same
 nation. Their other planta∣tion
was under mount
 
Hermon,
 or in mount 
Lebanon,
 as
 severall Scrip∣tures
doe place them. Now rather then any difference should a∣rise
herein, 
Hermon
 will humbly confess it self parcell of 
Lebanon,
 and
so the seeming contradiction is reconciled.






7 Iebusites.


Their abode is notoriously known to have been in, and about
 
Iebus

or 
Ierusalem,
 where they defied all 
Davids
 power to dispossess them, and
yet at last by 
Ioabs
 valour were ejected.


So much of the heathen Heptarchy in 
Canaan.
 Come we now to
consider a second edition of these nations, as God gave in a list of their
names to
 
Abraham,
 promising withall to give his posterity their coun∣trey
in possession. Here we find them tenne in number, the 
Hivites

being omitted, and four more added, namely,






8. 1 Kenites.


Of these no mention ever after in Scripture. For the 
Kenites
 descen∣ded
from 
Iethro
 (part whereof
 flitted from the South of 
Iudah
 to the
North of 
Nephthali
) were a different nation from these 
Kenites
 the sub∣ject
of our enquiry: we conceive therefore one of these two things most
probable.




1 Either after 
Abrahams
 and before 
Ioshua's
 time, by famine, sword,
and pestilence they were utterly deleted, and their land shared
betwixt the former seven nations of the 
Canaanites.


2 Or within the term aforesaid, being perchance too few and
feeble alone to maintain the dignity of a distinct nation, they
lost their names by listing themselves under some other people.








9. 2 Kenizites.


As deep silence of these in holy writ as of the former; as if they had
lived in
 
the land where allthings are forgotten.
 And probable it is, that betwixt

Abrahams
 and 
Ioshua's
 time (if a day may 
bring
 forth much,
 what alte∣rations
may four hundred years produce?) they were extinguished. 
All
flesh is grasse,
 and not onely particular men, like single blades, may be
mowed down by death, but even whole nations plucked up by the
roots, never to grow again, being buried without other monument
over or epitaph upon them, then that of the Psalmist,
 
their memoriall is
perished with them.






10. 3 Kadmonites.


That is, by the notation of the word, 
men of the east,
 or 
Easterlings
 if
you please. These a learned
 man with great likelyhood conceives to
be the 
Hivites;
 both because (as aforesaid) the 
Hivites
 are omitted in
this Catalogue, and because they lived in the eastern part of 
Canaan,

under mount 
Hermon.
 As for the opinion, that 
Cadmus
 the 
Phenician
 with

Hermione
 his wife were 
Hivites
 (Serpents their name sounds in Hebrew,


as we observed before) and therefore fabled by the
 Poet, to be turned
into Dragons; such as exclude it their judgment, because no solid
truth, may admit it into their fancy as a pleasing conceit.






11. 4 Rephaims.


Their position is undoubtedly known, living about 
Ashtaroth
 Car∣naim

in the half tribe of 
Manasseh
 beyond 
Iordan.
 But though here was
their principall nest, we find some of their feathers scattered in other
places, in a
 valley near 
Ierusalem
 of that name, and another in the
tribe
 of 
Ioseph,
 whither perchance they fled, when smitten at home by

 
Chedorlaomer.


But the last and largest volume of these nations of 
Canaan,
 is 
Gen.
 10.
15. where sixe more are added, dwelling in those parts of 
Canaan
 which
the 
Israelites
 never fully possessed. The former nations were as I may
say under the 
first qualification
 to 
dye without mercy,
 but these had more
favour afforded them, according to the honour of Martiall proceed∣ing.
These latter were never 
Servants in ordinary
 to the 
Israelites,
 ne∣ver
wholly subdued by them, but were onely 
retainers at large,
 doing
them homage at great solemnities, and high festivalls: understand
thereby all the victorious reignes of 
David
 and 
Solomon.
 We take them
in order.






12. 1 Zidonians.


Eminently known by their famous City, whereof largely here∣after.






13. 2 Archites.


These dwelt at 
Arca,
 or 
Arce,
 a City in 
Libanus
 over against 
Tripoly,

whereof mention in 
Ptolomeus.






14. 3 Sinites.


In searching after their proper place, we are at a losse, like 
Ioseph
 when
sent to seek his brethren; onely he, when wandring,
 met with a man to
direct him, we with many to distract us. Some place them near the
mountain of 
Sinai.
 But that barren desert affords no more livelyhood,
then the Law there delivered could give life unto men. Others seat them
neare 
Sin
 (by 
Ptolomy Simyra
) in the northern bound of the land. And
a third
 sort, whom we will follow, in the very south point thereof,
at the entrance of 
Egypt,
 near 
Pelusium,
 called 
Sin
 in the
 Scriptures,
whence the desert of 
Sin
 hath its name
.






15. 4 Arvadites.


These lived north of the 
Zidonians,
 whereof largely in the description
of mount 
Libanus.






16. 5 Zemarites.


More uncertain for situation then the former, because no
more mention of them. Had the land whereon they lived, like the
floor of 
Bels
 Temple, been strowed with ashes, some print of their
footsteps would have remained, whereas now no marks, to discover


them. Learned men thus groping in the dark, some seek (for lack of
other light) to light a candle from a glow-worm; their conceit being
no better, who from the vicinity of the sound, make these 
Zemarites
 in∣habit
mount 
Shemir
 (afterwards, 
Samaria
) which is confuted by the
Hebrew Orthography. More probably they may be placed at
 
Zema∣raim,

a City afterwards of 
Benjamin.






17. 6 Hamathites.


As formerly we had too little, here we have too much direction,
finding two eminent places equ
lly probable for their habitation▪ 
Ha∣math

on the north of 
Nepthali,
 and another many miles off, called 
Ha∣mah
the great,
 and afterwards 
Antiochia.
 And perchance they might re∣move
from the one to the other. So much of the nations descended
from 
Canaan,
 amongst whom the 
Philistims
 are not reckoned, (whose
five Satrapies possessed the South-west part of the land) because they
came not from 
Canaan,
 but from 
Mizraim
 his elder Brother, of whom
God willing largely hereafter in the descriptions of the tribes of 
Dan,

and 
Simeon.


To conclude▪ Let the reader beware lest deceived with the similitude
of sounds, he 
condemne the generation of the righteous,
 and mistake true

Israelites
 by birth, to be 
Canaanites
 by descent; as namely,



1 
Caleh
 the
 
Kenite,
 undoubtedly of the tribe of
 
Iudah,
 onely his
grandfathers name was 
Kenaz.


2 
Vriah
 the 
Hittite


3 
Ornan
 the 
Iebusite


so loyal


so liberal


to 
Da∣vid:




The first might be a Proselyte

Hittite,
 but more likely an 
Is∣raelite

whose Father was cal∣led

Heth;
 and the latter of the
tribe of
 
Iudah
 or
 
Benjamin,

who lived promiscuously
with the 
Iebusites
 in the City
of 
Iebus
 or 
Ierusalem.




4 
Hushi
 the 
Archite,
 who out-achitophelled 
Achitophell
 in his
policy, was probably an 
Ephraimite of the
 borders of Archi,
 otherwise
unlikely that 
David
 would have chosen a stranger to have been
his Cabinet counsellour.


5 
Simon
 the
 
Cananite,
 Christs Disciple, certainly a 
Iew,
 (other∣wise
our Saviour would not have entertained him in so near a
relation) born it seems in
 
Cana
 of 
Galile.




So much for caution, lest 
Demetrius
 who was 
well
 reported of all men,

suffer for 
Demetrius, Diana's
 silver-smith; and these reall 
Iews
 be mis∣represented
under the notion of heathen extraction.










CHAP. 8. The second solemn division of the land of Canaan into thirty one King∣domes.


§ 1. NExt to the distinguishing of this land into seven nations,
 we
must observe the division thereof amongst
 one and thirty
Kings. Strange, that their scepters (except very short) did not justle one
another, in so narrow a Countrey. But, we must know, that the Ge∣nius
of that age, delighted not so much, in scraping much together, as
in having absolute authority in that little, which was their own. Pride
is commonly the sinne of young men, covetousness of old folk. The
world in the youth thereof, more affected honour, then wealth, high
titles, then large treasure. And these 
Royolets
 contented themselves, that
their crowns (though not so big) were as bright, their scepters
(though not so great) were as glistering, as those of the mightiest
Monarchs, being as absolute Soveraignes in their own small terri∣tories.


§ 2. Let us consider,
 how these one and thirty kingdomes were
afterwards disposed of, and how they were shared amongst the seve∣rall
Tribes. In reckoning up their names, we observe the method in

 
Ioshua,
 as he marshalls them upon order following;

By the King of the nations of 
Gilgal,
 understand a Soveraign over
a miscellaneous company of people, the master-bee of a swarm not
yet fixed in an hive, having a sufficient territory for his men, but no


considerable Metropolis of his kingdome. In this Catalogue, 
Sihon
 and

Og
 are not reckoned, whose dominions lay 
ast of 
Iordan,
 and they
make up thirty three Kings in all. So much of these Cities for
the present; whereof largely hereafter in those respective Tribes to
which they belong.


§ 3. Amongst these Kings one may visibly discover two distinct
combinations.




1 In the southern circuit of 
Canaan, Adoni-bezek
 King of 
Ierusalem

seems to be chief of this knot, at whose
 sending the Kings
of 
Hebron, Iarmuth, Lachish, Eglon &c.
 assembled themselves
against 
Ioshua,
 and were destroyed by him.


2 In the northern Association. There
 
I
bin
 the King had the
precedency, with whom the Kings of 
Madon, Shimron,
 and

Achshaph &c.
 confederated themselves against 
Ioshua
 with the
same success.




Had all at once ingaged against 
Ioshua,
 the task had been hard;
had he fought them all severally, the work had been long to subdue
them. For, these thirty and one Kings, who made up a full moneth in
their number, how many years would they have made up in their
resistance? Whereas now divine providence fitting the strength of

Ioshua's
 arm, parcelled his foes into two bundles, that he might the
more easily at two blows, strike through both of them.


§ 4. And here we present the Reader with a draught of the land,

as it was in the days of 
Abraham,
 and continued till the time of 
Ioshua;

not well satisfied, whether more properly to term it 
old,
 or 
new Canaan.
 If
we count from the beginning of the world downwards, it was young
or new 
Canaan,
 because nearest the creation; if we reckon backwards
from our time, the old 
Canaan.
 If the Reader discover any difference
betwixt this, and the next Map of the same land, as it was consti∣tuted
after the days of 
Ioshua,
 let him consider,



1 How the same face is disguised by different dressing. 
Palestine

afterwards (when divided betwixt the twelve Tribes) being
tricked and trimmed with many new Cities, had the favour
thereof quite altered.


2 How the pictures drawn by the same exact Artist, of the same
person, first when a youth, afterwards when an old man,
must have much difference betwixt them; and the distance of
some hundreds of years, causeth a necessary variation in the de∣scriptions
of the same Countreys.




It will be objected, that though age and accidents may alter the old,
and induce new lineaments in mens faces, yet the Simile holds not
in the description of Countreys, where the same chanels of sea, cour∣ses
of rivers, falls of vales, flats of plains, ridges of hills, must re∣main.
As for mountains, time, for want of carriage, must be forced


to leave such luggage behind her; and therefore that such land, and
water-marks, must always continue, without any considerable altera∣tion.
But it is answered, that even these seeming Standards of nature,
are moveable with time and casualty, inundations, tempests, and earth∣quakes;
in the last (being the earths violent cough) sometimes she spits up
her own lungs, casting up great hills where never were any before. What
the Apostle speaks in an higher sense, is true of the materiall world, and
the severall countreys therein,
 
The fashion of this world passeth away;
 so that
to the very view of the eye, the shape, form, and garb thereof is meta∣morphosed.
Besides, other Anagrams hapning in the land of 
Canaan,

lands afterwards transposed for water, and water for land; one is most
remarkable, namely, when the pleasant 
vale of
 Siddim
 nigh the banks
of 
Iordan,
 was turned into the salt-sea, or noisome Asphaltite-lake. 
This
was the work of the Lord, and it may justly seem marvellous in our eyes.
 But of
the cause, time, and manner of this alteration, largely God willing here∣after.


Here the Map of old 
Canaan
 it to be inserted.
















CHAP. 9. The third division of the land into twelve Tribes, some of all which Tribes re∣mained
untill, at, and after the time of our Saviour.


§ 1. THe third solemn division of 
Palestine,
 was made by 
Ioshua
 in∣to
twelve Tribes, of whose severall bounds largely in our en∣suing
discourse. This partition remained untill 
Shalmaneser
 carried ten
Tribes away captive, and in exchange, brought in his own colonies to
possess their conquered Countrey. However, although the main body
of the ten Tribes were thus transplanted, without any hope to return to
their native soil, yet some competent representation of every Tribe, re∣mained
behind in their own countrey, even untill, at, and after the time
of Christ, and his Apostles.


§ 2. Alledge not to the contrary, that it is said, after 
Shalmaneser
's car∣rying
them away captive,
 
there was none left but the Tribe of Iudah onely.

Understand it, that 
Iudah
 onely remained in the flourishing condition
of a kingdome. That onely was the visible standing-corn, amongst
which, others of 
Israel,
 like loose eares were scattered. But to the point,
that some gleanings of these ten Tribes, remained in their countrey, af∣ter
the Assyrian captivity, may be proved;



1 From the very nature of a generall calamity, which lighting on
a populous nation, cannot so particularly apply it self to every
individuall person, but that some will escape. The
 
hired rasor

made not such clean work, as to shave every hair, but that some
small down might creep under the edge thereof. That
 
Besome
of destruction
 swept not so clean, but that some dust may be
presumed left behind in the small crevices of the countrey.
Some (no doubt) by timely flight, casuall absence, especiall fa∣vour,
secret concealment, might escape; and others, through
age and sickness unable to travell, might be permitted to re∣main
behind.


2 Mention is made of a
 
remnant which escaped out of the hands of the King
of Assyria.
 And when 
iezekiah
 kept his solemn passover, he sent

messengers to 
Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, Zebulun, Asher,
 some of
whom made a mock at his courtesie, and others thankfully em∣braced
his gracious invitation.


3 
Iosiah
 in his passover (celebrated in the eighteenth year of his reign,
ninety and odde years after the banishment of the twelve Tribes)
assembled there
 
all Iudah and Israel that were present,
 or 
found.




§ 3. Such remnants of the ten Tribes, being afterwards carried cap∣tive
with 
Iudah
 to 
Babylon,
 returned thence with the rest of their bre∣thren;
as probably is insinuated,



1 By the sacrifice at the dedication of the second Temple,
 
A sin


offering for all Israel, twelve hee-goats according to the number of the
Tribes of Israel.
 In expression (no doubt) of gladness, of some
of every Tribe present thereat.


2 By the number of such as returned, amounting to
 
forty two thou∣sand
three hundred and threescore.
 Now, whosoever shall be plea∣sed,
to cast up the particular sums, of the severall families of 
Iudah

and 
Benjamin
 set down there, will find them fall short twelve
thousand of the foresaid number. Where therefore shall we sup∣ply
the account? Hear how the great Jewish-Chronicle (set
forth not long after our Saviours time) resolves this question;

 
Surely, they were made up of those who came up from Babylon to Ierusa∣lem,
of other Tribes.


3 The
 Scripture saith, after the captivity of 
Babylon
 that there dwelt
in 
Ierusalem
 (besides those of 
Iudah
 and 
Benjamin) of the children
of Ephraim and Manasseh.




Nor is the testimony of 
Iosephus
 to be slighted herein, though 
Ios.
 
Scaliger
 causlesly condemns it, affirming that the King of 
Egypt
 em∣ployed
seventy two 
Iews
 to translate the Bible into Greek, taking six out
of every Tribe, which compleat that number.


§ 4. That such fragments of the ten Tribes returning from 
Babylon,
 were
reestated in their ancient possessions, I dare not affirm, but rather be∣lieve
the contrary. For there was no inducting them into their former
inheritances, because no vacancy or avoidance therein; 
terra plena,
 the
land was still full with the plantation of 
Medes
 and others brought in by

Shalmaneser.
 So that this remnant of the ten Tribes, were (for the main)
fain promiscuously to make their habitations where they might, whilst

Iudah
 and 
Benjamin
 were restored to their ancient, intire, and distinct
possessions. Yet there is some probability, that some of 
Zebulun
 and

Nephthali
 in our Saviours time had recovered part of their ancient patri∣mony.
Otherwise the force of 
Isaiahs
 prophecy, and 
Matthews
 applica∣tion
is much impaired:
 
The land of Zebulun and the land of Nephthali &c.
The people that sate in darkness saw great light.
 That is in a genuine and un∣strained
sense, their posterity had the day of deliverance first dawning
unto them, whose ancestors were first overtaken with the night of af∣fliction.


§ 5. That in the time of Christ, and his Apostles, some pious people
of all Tribes, were extant in 
Iudea,
 plainly appears,



1 By
 
Anna
 the Prophetess, which was of the Tribe of 
Asher.


2 By Saint 
Pauls
 expression,
 
Unto which promise, our twelve Tribes in∣stantly
serving God day and night, hope to come.
 This cannot be meant
of those departed this life, before Saint 
Pauls
 time, (which were
past hope and in possession of the promise) but of such as served
God then, when this speech was uttered.


3 By the superscription of 
S. Iames
 his Epistle,
 
To the twelve Tribes


which are scattered abroad, greeting.
 Being Christian 
Iews
 probably,

 dispersed from 
Ierusalem,
 after the martyrdome of Saint 
Stephen.




§ 6. To conclude, what in the Law God prescribed concerning the

fields,
 he was pleased graciously to practise upon the 
persons of the Israelites.


 
Thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape in thy vine∣yard.
 He suffered a small racemation to remain, still preserving
 
, and not wholly discomposing the solemn Jury of the twelve
Tribes, which untill Christs time were made the thinner, but not the
fewer, by all their calamities. For, although thorough continuance of
time, suddain and great changes in their condition, laziness and neglect,
casuall losing, and spightfull embezeling of their Records, mixt ma∣riages
with heathens, and many other accidents the intireness of their
Pedegrees was much perplext and interrupted; yet by tradition from
their parents, they knew in generall their extraction from those Tribes,
though unable particularly, to clear the immediate series of their de∣scents.






CHAP. 10. Of Palestine rent into two kingdomes, under Rehoboam; and their severall
strengths balanced.


§ 1. THe next solemn division, the land of 
Canaan
 fell under, was,
when it was cloven by the ten Tribes
 defection, into the king∣domes
of 
Iudah,
 and 
Israel.


§ 2. The kingdome of 
Iudah
 consisted chiefly of the Tribe of 
Iudah,

which alone was so powerfull, and populous, that the men thereof, in
the muster made by King
 
David,
 amounted in number to moe, then
the half of all the other Tribes there expressed. Besides the body of this
Tribe, very considerable were the appurtenances thereof, namely,


Some of



Simeon,
 whose inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of
the Tribe of Iudah.


Dan,
 part of whose possession was taken out of what ori∣ginally
was assigned to 
Iudah.




These must be presumed, to beare a State-sympathy to the kingdome
of 
Iudah,
 ingaged thereunto by the position of their countrey. Yea, we
finde it expressed in Scripture, that
 
Beersheba
 a City of 
Simeon;
 and
 
Gath,


 
Zorah,
 and
 
Ajalon,
 Cities of 
Dan,
 did belong to, and were fortified by
the Kings of 
Iudah.


§ 3. Besides these, two thirds of the Tribe of 
Benjamin,
 pertained to
the same kingdome; as also all the 
Levites
 which 
left
 their Cities in

Israel,
 and clave to the house of 
David.
 These, though properly the eyes
of the land, had hands also, and contributed to the strength of the king∣dome.
Adde hereunto all the well-affected, which out of all the Tribes


of
 
Israel
 resorted to 
Ierusalem.
 For, the by-ditches of 
Dan
 and 
Bethel,

did not so drain the peoples devotion, but that much thereof ran in the
right chanel to the Temple; and no doubt, many violently kept at home,
had their hearts at 
Ierusalem,
 and their bodies in 
Israel,
 to which king∣dome
all the rest of the Tribes did belong.


§ 4. Here it will be richly worth our pains, to enter on a compara∣tive
estimate of these two Kingdomes, which of them exceeded in puis∣sance:
Herein we shall carry an impartiall hand; and indeed, though
the controversie be betwixt two Kings, there is nothing to be got by
flattering of either.


§ 5. We will compare them first in that, wherein 
Solomon
 placeth
the honour of a King,
 
the multitude of their subjects.
 And here any clear
judgment will find for the Kings of 
Israel.


§ 6. Secondly, if the extent of their dominions be surveyed, and our
eye in the Map made umpirer therein, the case is clear in view without
measuring, that 
Israel
 was the greatest.


§ 7. Thirdly, if their Cities be numbred, the result will be this, 
Iudah

had the Sun, 
Ierusalem; Israel
 had the Moon, 
Samaria,
 and most Starres
of the first magnitude, 
Ieri
ho, Iezreel, Mahanaim &c.


§ 8. Fourthly, if their ports, and naval power be considered, neither
will be found very active that way, contentedly yeelding their sea-tra∣ding
to the 
Phenicians.
 Yet 
Israel
 had the advantage of havens, and marine
accommodations, bordering most on the Mediterranean; 
Iudah
 also (to
hold the scales even) had 
Ezion-Gaber,
 a considerable port on the Red-sea,
as may appear by 
Ahaziahs
 request to 
Iehosaphat,
 
Let my servants goe with
thy servants in the ships;
 plainly importing, that the men of 
Iudah
 were the
Cape-merchants and prime mariners in those seas, by whose courtesie
the subjects of the Kings of 
Israel,
 were admitted to trafique there. How∣ever,

Ezion-Gaber
 on the Red-sea was but a key to the back-door (little
of the East-Indies being then known, and less traded to) whereas the
havens on the Midland-sea opened the broad gates of commerce to the
most and best frequented parts of the world.


§ 9. Fifthly, if the absoluteness of their Kings power be stated in
their respective dominions, here in the opinions of some the upper hand
must be adjudged to 
Iudah.
 The Kings whereof in administration of
justice (or rather revenge) often exercised arbitrary power, making
use of their prerogative above law. As appears by 
Solomons
 proceedings
against the lives of 
Shimei, Ioab,
 and 
Adoniah;
 and more plainly in 
Ieho∣ram's


 executing his own brethren, by his peremptory pleasure, with∣out
legall conviction of them. Whereas no monument is extant, of
such arbitrary proceedings in the kings of 
Israel,
 more confining them∣selves
to legall courses. Yea, the very murder of 
Naboth
 carried the face
of a judiciall process, wherein legall 
n
 formalities of witnesses, though
suborned, were observed in a solemn Session. The reason why the Kings


of 
Iudah
 were more unlimited in their power, was, say they, because
they derived their title immediately from the God of heaven, confir∣med
in 
Davids
 familie by severall descents. But the Kings of 
Israel,
 be∣ing
Creatures of their own subjects, made by popular election, on con∣dition
to remit their taxes and burdens, (and seldome above three of the
same stock in a direct succession) were fain to ingratiate themselves,
with remitting much of that royall rigour used by the Kings of 
Iudah.

And this is assigned by a judicious
 Author as a principall cause why

Israel
 never returned to their former subjection to 
Davids
 family, because
the scepter of 
Iudah
 was too heavy for them, and they lived under more
liberty in their own kingdome.


§ 10. Sixtly, if their forain impressions, made by them on neigh∣bouring
Princes be considered, the balance is so even, it is hard to say,
on which side the beam breaketh. For, as memorable were the victo∣ries
of the Kings of 
Israel
 against the 
Syrians,
 so no lesse fortunate the
fights of some Kings
 of 
Iudah
 against the 
Ethiopians,
 and other enemies.
And as the kingdome of 
Moab,
 till the death of 
Ahab,
 was
 tributary to

Israel:
 so 
Edom,
 untill the end of the reign
 of 
Iehosaphat,
 was in subjecti∣on
to the crown of 
Iudah.


§ 11. Seventhly, if their home-achievements each against other, be
recounted, (the truest touch-stone of their severall strengths) God often
made them alternately hold up one another, whilst he whipt them both
for their sinnes. But although 
Abijah
 once got a remarkable
 conquest
of 
Ieroboam,
 yet generally 
Israel
 worsted 
Iudah,
 overpowering them with
multitude of men. Thus 
Baasha
 cooped up 
Asa
 in his own land; 
Ioash


 overcame 
Amaziah,
 and took 
Ierusalem;
 and 
Pekah
 almost utterly
 con∣sumed

Ahaz,
 and his kingdome.


§ 12. To conclude, if their lasting and continuance be measured,
herein 
Iudah
 clearly carrieth away the preheminence. Grant, 
Israel
 beat

Iudah
 at hand, yet 
Iudah
 beat 
Israel
 at length, even out of distance. For,
whilst the 
Babylonish
 captivity did onely snuffe 
Iudah,
 for seventy years,
(blazing the brighter when they returned from banishment) the 
Assy∣rian

conquest utterly extinguished 
Israel,
 from ever appearing again, in a
formed Common-wealth, in their own Countrey.






CHAP. 11. Of the partition of the Land into the Provinces of Galilea, Samaria,
and Judea.


§ 1. WHen these two kingdomes had determined, & the division
of the twelve Tribes was out of date, 
Palestine
 began to be
distinguished into three Provinces, whose number and posture we
find in the Evangelists, being traced in order by the feet of our Saviour,



 1. 
He left Iudea. 2. And departed again into Galilee. 3. And he must needs goe
through Samaria.
 It being denied to our Saviour himself, to travail 
per
saltum, à termino ad terminum sine medio,
 so that he could not ordinarily pass
from 
Iudah
 in the south, to 
Galilee
 in the north, without traversing 
Sa∣maria,

which lay in the midst betwixt both.


§ 2. To begin with 
Iudea,
 or 
Iury;
 it is not taken here in that large
acception, wherein it contained the whole Countrey, and entire sub∣ject
of this our book (in which sense 
Herod the great
 is styled
 
King of
Iudea
) but is taken, as
 elsewhere it is termed, the 
Province of Iudea,
 for
a third part of the whole land, consisting of the ground formerly
belonging to 
Iudah, Benjamin, Simeon, Dan,
 and 
Reuben.
 For, that this
Province reached eastward, beyond the River, plainly appears in the
 Evangelists, affirming, that Christ 
came from Galilee into the Coasts of Iudea
beyond Iordan.
 A spacious Countrey it was, and in our Saviours time,
the proper habitation of the principall 
Iews.
 Nor is it amiss to observe,
that a portion of land (with the governments of 
Lidda
 and 
Ramah
) ly∣ing
in the juncture of 
Benjamin
 and 
Ephraim,
 was in the time of the 
Mac∣cabees,

taken from 
Samaria,
 by King 
Demetrius,
 and by him
 assigned to

Iudea,
 in reward of the friendship, and faithfulness of the 
Iews
 in his
service; which gore, or gusset of ground, was called 
Apherema,
 that is,

a thing taken away,
 because parted from 
Samaria,
 and pieced to 
Iudea.


§ 3. 
Samaria
 succeeds,
 whereby we understand not, the City of that
name, for a long time, 
Metropolis
 of the kingdome of 
Israel;
 but a coun∣trey
(formerly pertaining to 
Ephraim,
 and 
Manasseh,
 and
 
Gad
) peopled
after the 
Assyrian
 captivity, with colonies brought thither from
 
Babylon,

and the neighbouring Dominions. At first this land did not fadge well
with these new inhabitants, Lions sent by God disturbing their quiet
possession; untill a Priest of the 
Israelites
 was remanded, to teach them

 
the manner of the God of the land.
 But, what betwixt an ignorant Master,
and indocible Scholars, nothing was learnt to purpose. He taught them
no true worship, but onely 
Ieroboams
 divinity (as appears by their
 ap∣pointing
out Priests of themselves for their high-places) and they jum∣bled
together their own numerous Idols, with the service of God. In so
much, as they are said to
 
fear the Lord,
 and in the next verse, 
not to fear the
Lord:
 not that there is any contradiction in the text, but an open op∣position,
betwixt their pretence, and practise; seeing such as fear God
otherwise, then his will in his Word prescribes, fear him not in effect.


§ 4. However, afterwards the 
Samaritans
 quitted their multitude of
Idols,
 and patched up a religion amongst themselves, wherein,



1 They adored one 
Deity,
 but him so erroneously, that Christ flatly
told them,
 
yee worship that which you know not.


2 They acknowledged onely the five books of 
Moses
 for Canoni∣call.


3 They had a Temple on mount 
Gerizim,
 stickling for the ho∣nour


and holiness thereof to equall, yea exceed that at 
Ierusalem


4 They expected a Saviour, beleeving him as able, so willing to re∣solve
all important difficulties;
 
When Messiah is come, he will tell
us all things.


5 They falsly accounted themselves extracted from the ancient
Hebrew Patriarchs.




Thus the 
Samaritan
 woman had it rise in her mouth,
 
our Father Iacob,

though in very deed, he was no more her Father, then the man she kept
company with, was her husband, being neither lineally descended from
the one, nor lawfully maried to the other. Hear what 
Iosephus
 hath to
this purpose; 
The Samaritans,
 says he,
 
are of this nature, that when the Iews
are high in fortune and success, presently they embrace society with them, and deduce
the series of their own descent from the Patriarch Ioseph, and his sonnes Ephraim
and Manasseb: But when the Iews are depressed and low in estate, then they disclaim
all kindred, defie all affinity with them, professing themselves (as indeed they are)
to be originally Medes and Persians.


§ 5. Generally great was the Antipathy betwixt the 
Samaritans
 and 
Iews.
 The former persecuting every face that did but look towards 
Ie∣rusalem;

on which bare account they churlishly denied our Saviour en∣tertainment
in their town, because
 
his behaviour was as though he would
goe to Ierusalem.
 Nor came the 
Iews
 behind them in hatred, so far from
familiar
 conversing with them, that a 
Iew
 would rather contentedly
endure thirst, then, to quench it, crave drink of a 
Samaritan,
 lest such
hands should defile the water, with the very drawing of it. Yea when
the malice of the 
Iews
 meant mortally to wound our Saviours re∣putation,
they said, he was a
 
Samaritan and had a Devill.
 However, the
deluge of sin did not so generally drown all the 
Samaritans,
 but that
some dry Islands, some good men were found amongst them. One
eminent for his gratitude to God, being the tithe of the lepers cleansed by
Christ, who
 alone returned to give him thanks; & another no less com∣mendable
for his charity to
 man, being Physitian, Surgeon, Host, and
in a word, 
neighbour
 to the unknown traveller wounded by theeves in
his journey to 
Iericho.


§ 6. 
Galilee
 remaines, so called (as
 
Melanchthon
 will have it) because
in Hebrew signifying a bound or limit, lying in the northern marches
of the land. It was twofold,



The Upper formerly belong∣ing to the tribes of 
Asher, Nephthali,
 and 
Manasseh
 be∣yond

Iordan.


The Lower, formerly belong∣ing to the tribes of 
Zebulun,
 and 
Issachar.




The upper 
Galilee
 is also called
 
Galilee of the Gentiles,
 or, 
Galilaea Gojim,

whereof many reaasons are rendred by learned men. These two most
considerable, either that it was so called, because very populous, in
which consideration it is termed by
 
Iosephus
 
; affirming,
that the least 
 village therein had fifteen thousand inhabitants. So


that, 
Galilea Gojim,
 or of the 
Gentiles,
 is the same with populous 
Galilee.

(If any except that 
Gojim
 in Scripture is onely taken for Heathen, never
for the people of the 
Iews,
 may he be remitted to learned
 
Rivet,
 by in∣stances
to the contrary to have his judgment rectified herein) or else, it
was called 
Galilee of the Gentiles,
 because it bordered on them, and lay in
the passage through which travellers journied to the 
Gentiles.
 Thus the
gate of
 
Ephraim
 in 
Ierusalem
 got the name thereof, not that it stood in, but
led toward the Tribe of 
Ephraim.


§ 7. The 
Galileans
 were high spirited people,


 
, 
fighters
from their infancy,
 impatient of wrong, lovers of liberty, and prone to re∣venge.
Much of their nature may be read in their countrey-man Saint

Peter,
 forward (not to say furious) in hot bloud, to draw his
 sword
though at great disadvantage, and after, at leasure to repent it. Apt they
were to raise tumults against the 
Romans,
 but always with ill success.
Witness especially, when they pretended sacrifice to cloak their Rebelli∣on,
but 
Pilat
 was too quick and cunning for them, who subduing them,

 
mingled their bloud with their sacrifices.
 They were distinguishable by their
Dialect from other 
Iews,
 speaking a broader, or (as I may say) a 
Dorick
Syriack,
 whereof the maid minded Saint 
Peter, Thou
 art a Galilean, and thy
speech agreeth thereunto.
 They were accounted courser, and less refined 
Iews,

as appears by the expression of the Evangelist,
 
The Galileans received him,
having seen all the things that he did at Ierusalem at the feast, for they also went up
vnto the feast.
 Where those words, 
for they also,
 though they admit the

Galileans
 to the communion of the same Religion with the 
Iews,
 yet set
them at a second table, as inferiour to the other. Yea, the 
Iews
 called
our Saviour in disgrace, at least wise in diminution, a 
Galilean.
 Might
I presume to interpose my opinion, I should conceive these 
Galileans

were chiefly extracted from the remainder of the ten Tribes, left behind
in the land, after the 
Assyrian
 captivity, as we have shewed before.


§ 8. If these three Provinces be in severall respects,
 compared toge∣ther,
they behave themselves as followeth,


For



Antiquity; 
Galilee
 the first, (mentioned
 in 
Ioshua) Iudea
 the next,

Samaria
 the youngest.


Extent; 
Iudea
 the greatest, 
Galilee
 the next, 
Samaria
 the smal∣lest.


Honour; 
Iudea
 the highest, (because 
Ierusalem
 therein) 
Samaria

the next, 
Galilee
 the meanest.


Safety; 
Samaria
 the first (best secured in the middle) 
Iudea

next, 
Galilee
 last, and most exposed to enemies.


Fruitfulness; 
Galilee
 the first, 
Samaria
 second, 
Iudea
 mountainous,
and less fruitfull, by the testimony of Saint 
Hierom.




This distinction of these three Provinces lasted till the destruction of
the second Temple, but abated in the solemnity thereof, by the ensuing
partition into Tetrarchies.








CHAP. 12. Of the division of this land into four Tetrarchies, and some other small territories.


§ 1. MUch about the time of our Saviours birth,
 this land was di∣vided
into four Tetrarchies. A Tetrarchy is conceived by

 some to be a dominion, wherein are 
 
: i.e. 
four
squadrons and sixty four men.
 Others, with 
Pliny,
 take it to be a countrey,
with four Cities therein. But learned
 
Salmasius,
 to whom we refer the
reader, confutes these for erroneous, where he proveth a Tetrarchy to be
a fourth part of a kingdome; be the men, or Cities therein more or less.
These Tetrarchies in 
Iudea,
 took their originall from the Testament of

Herod
 the great, who leaving severall Sons, bequeathed unto them par∣cells
of his Kingdome.


§ 2. Afterwards,
 with some alteration of their limits, these Tetrar∣chies
in 
Iudea
 were continued by the 
Romans
 (as also elsewhere in the
Countrey of 
Galatia
) on very politick considerations;



1. Hereby they had the advantage four to one, to gratifie and ingage
more friends, with Princely honour; seeing one kingdome thus
thriftily managed, afforded four Tetrarchies; as he may be
charitable to moe, who changeth his pence into farthings.


2 As they gratified moe; so they trusted less, it being no wisdome
to venture too much power, in one and the same person.


3 The restless nature of the 
Iews
 required many overseers; and
a small territory amongst them, would yeeld the Governour
thereof plentifull employment.




In
 Saint 
Luke,
 we find the number and order of these Tetrarchies,
namely, when 
Iohn Baptist
 began to preach,


Pilate
 was Governour of 
Iudea.


Herod
 was Tetrarch of 
Galilee.


Philip
 was Tetrarch of 
Iturea,
 and 
Trach
nitis.


Lysanias
 was Tetrarch of 
Abilen
.


Pilate
 is styled Governour, having precedency of the rest, as residing in

Ierusalem
 the principall City, and (perchance) had a superintendency
over the other Tetrarchs, by vertue whereof he suppressed the rebel
lious


Galileans,
 which were otherwise of 
Herods
 dominion. Howsoever
they observed their distinct jurisdictions; for, 
Pilat
 hearing that Christ
was of 
Galilee,
 sent him to 
Herod,
 to be tried before him: either out of
civility, because he would not incroach on anothers jurisdiction; or
out of policy, to decline so distastfull, and dangerous employment; at
leastwise to divide the Odium betwixt them, that 
Herod
 should have his
share, if not his half thereof.


§ 3. Concerning the bounds of 
Iudea
 and 
Galilee (Samaria
 being so
swallowed up betwixt them,
 that the southern part thereof belonged to

Iudea,
 the northern to 
Galilee
) largely in the last Chapter. Of 
Iturea
 here∣after
more fully in the Description of 
Nephthali.
 As for 
Abilene,
 we are


less solicitous in assigning the accurate bounds thereof, because it lay
wholly out of the land of 
Canaan,
 the proper subject of our discourse.

Abilene,
 called by 
Ptolemy Abilene Lysaniae,
 being a fair City in 
Coelosyria,

where the dominions thereof ranged far on the north of 
Libanus.
 If any
demand, why the Tetrarchy of 
Abilene
 is mentioned by Saint 
Luke,
 see∣ing
it was an exotick, and forain territory, out of the pale of 
Palestine;
 let
them know, it was done out of the over aboundant exactness of the
Evangelist, for these reasons:



1 The more exquisitely to notifie the particular time of his histo∣ry,
not onely by the date of the Governours of 
Iudea,
 but also of
contemporary neighbouring Princes. And the harmony in
chronology is the sweeter, the more are brought into the consort.


2 Because many dispersed 
Iews,
 equally concerned in Christ, and
the benefit of the Gospell, lived scattered in 
Abilene.


3 Because having formerly mentioned three Tetrarchs, the num∣ber
had not been perfect, and entire, without adding the fourth.
Thus some English coines being quarter-pieces, cannot be put
away in payment without loss, except four of them be joined
together.


4 Because, though 
Abilene
 was not within the compass of the lesser

Canaan,
 possessed by the 
Iews;
 yet it was within the bounds of
the larger 
Canaan,
 that Countrey once belonging to the 
Archites,

and 
Arvadites
 the sons of 
Canaan.




§ 4. Now whosoever shall with a Compasse in his hand,
 survey the
extent of these Tetrarchies, will finde them to fall out very uneven in
their dimensions, some much larger then others. Indeed they were
measured with no other scale, then the favour and friendship of the
Emperour, so that the best befriended at 
Rome,
 got most dominion in

Palestine.
 Yet were these Tetrarchies as justly divided, as our English
Hundreds, (and those perchance equall in their primitive institution,
for number of men) seeing we count threescore and eight hundreds in

 
Kent,
 and but six in 
Lancashire,
 accounted little less in the compass there∣of.
Nor was the Revenues of these Tetrarchies, less unequall then their
extent, the 
 or yearly income of 
Trachonitis,
 with the appurte∣nances
belonging to 
Philip,
 amounting,
 as 
Iosephus
 computeth it, but
to an hundred talents; whilest 
Galilee,
 with its appendents, returned
two hundred; and 
Iudea,
 advantaged with the friendly City of 
Ierusa∣lem,

yeelded four hundred talents yearly to the Governour.


§ 5. Indeed exactness in observing the bounds of these Tetrarchies,

is not to be expected; which, in process of time, passed under all parts
of numeration; Multiplied, Subtracted, Added to, new Divided, made
moe, made fewer, made other then in their primitive establishment.
Let not therefore the Reader be moved, if sometimes he find moe
Tetrarchies, sometimes fewer then four, mentioned by good Authours


in 
Palestine,
 seeing as
 
Salmasius
 informs us, the word Tetrarchy in after∣ages
was negligently taken, for a part or parcell of dominion, without
relating to the exact proportion of a fourth part. Thus it is usuall for
barbarous tongues, to seduce words (as I may say) from their native
purity, custome corrupting them to signifie things contrary to their ge∣nuine,
and grammaticall notation. Who knows not, but that the word

Moity,
 both in
 law, and true language▪ importeth the just midst, and
true half of a thing? though 
small moity
 in ordinary discourse is taken for
any Canton, or small portion. And in a more proper instance, though
the 
Cinque Ports
 are notoriously known to be five, as the name signi∣fieth;
yet reckoned up with their members they make seven, as I doubt
not, but six, yea moe Tetrarchies, may sometimes be told in 
Palestine.


§ 6. And now to take our farewell,
 of the severall divisions of this
land, mentioned in Scripture, (for on such onely we insist) it will not
be amiss to minde the Reader, that besides the foresaid partitions, we
finde some other territories in 
Iudea,
 having proper names and bounds
to themselves, but the latter so excentricall, that they fall out neither even
with any one Tribe, nor adequate to any of the Provinces, or territories
formerly described. Such are,



1 
Idumea,
 sometimes taken more strictly, for the south part
 of 
Iu∣dea;

sometimes more largely (as always in the old
 Testa∣ment)
for the land of 
Edom,
 and the adjacent Dominion.


2 
Perea, (
 to cross the water
 is frequent in the travels of our
Saviour) being a countrey containing all the land once belong∣ing
to 
Reuben, Gad,
 and 
Manasseh
 on the east of 
Iordan.


3 
Decapolis,
 that is, a land with ten Cities therein; the just propor∣tion
of command given to the good servant, who improved his
five to ten pounds, 
Take thou authority
 over ten Cities.




However, such is the variety even betwixt good authors, that a∣mongst
them the ten Cities of 
Decapolis,
 are almost ten severall ways rec∣koned
up. We will onely set down two, the most authentick com∣putations
of them.




Pliny
 his account.


1 Damascus.


2 Opoton.


3 Philadelphia, 
once
 Rabba.


4 Raphana.


5 Seythopolis, 
once
 Bethsan.


6 Gaddara.


7 Hippon.


8 Pella.


9 Galasa, 
for
 Gerasa.


10 Canatha.






Brochard
 his account.


1 Tiberias.


2 Sephet.


3 Kedesh-nepthali.


4 Hazor.


5 Capernaum.


6 Caesarea Philippi.


7 Iotopata.


8 Bethsaida.


9 Chorazin.


10 Scythopolis.





The reason of their great difference may be this, that in continuance of
time, some of these ancient Cities fell into decay, or disfavour to for∣feit
their franchises, whilst later places might succeed to their lost im∣munities.


§ 7. Here we pass over in silence,
 the division of 
Iudea
 into the

 
Hill-countrey,
 and the
 
Low-countrey;
 because this distinction is not ap∣propriate
to 
Palestine,
 but usuall, and obvious in all other kingdomes. I
remember whilest I lived in the West of England and confines of 
Sum∣merset-shire,

hearing a labourer speak much of his long living in the low-countreys,
I demanded of him, whether he had ever been at 
Amsterdam?

He answered, that 
he had never been there, but often at Taunton.
 Whereby I
plainly perceived, what low-countreys he meant, namely the flat and
levell of 
Summerset-shire,
 under 
Quantock-hills,
 according to the language
of the people in those parts. Thus when the Tribe of 
Iudah
 is said to
conquer the 
Can
anites
 in the
 
low-countrey,
 we understand the champion
and plain-field in 
Iudea,
 which lay at the foot of the mountains.


§ 8. We meet in Scripture with many other petite tracts of
ground,
 honoured with names of lands; as, the land of
 
Hepher,
 the
land of
 
Dor,
 the land of
 
Zuph,
 the land of
 
Shual
 &c. and in the new
Testament the land of
 
Gennesareth,
 with many other. These may be
compared to our 
Gilsland
 in 
Cumberland, Cleveland
 in 
York-shire,
 Marishland
in 
Norfolk, Lovingland
 in 
Suffolk, Portland
 in 
Dorset-shire:
 places which
sound so big, that if measured by the ear, and length of syllables, they
would be accounted Kingdomes, or Counties at least, whereas surveyed
by the sight, and scale of miles, they appeare like the aforesaid lands in

Palestine,
 very small, and little parcells of ground, whereof largely as we
light on them hereafter in our severall descriptions.






CHAP. 13. How the Hebrews measured places. Of their cubits, furlongs, miles and Sab∣bath-days-journeys.


§ 1. THe Hebrews distanced their places by severall measures,

some arbitrary, casuall, and uncertain; others certain, as
reduced to a constant standard. Of the former was their measuring of
land by paces, for we
 read, when 
David
 solemnly brought the Ark into

Ierusalem, when he had gone six paces he offered oxen and fallings.
 But here we
are left at a loss in point of certainty, taking it rather for an ambulatory,
then a Geometricall pace, and then how vast the difference herein? For

Saul
 being higher from the shoulders
 upward, then the rest of 
Israel,
 by
the symmetry of parts, his pace must be presumed proportionably lon∣ger
then other men. Nor more certain was the Hebrews measuring
their land by a 
bow-shoot,
 as 
Hagar
 is said, to set her son 
I
hmael a good way


off, as it were
 a bow-shoot;
 which if at rovers, or randome, admits of va∣riation,
according to the strength of the bow, might or sleight of the
archer, weight or fashion of the arrow.


§ 2. As little certainty is also to be had,
by measuring of ground by
days-journeys.
 
Moses
 in the name of his countrey-men requested 
Pharaoh,

that they might goe
 
three days journey into the wildernesse, and sacrifice unto
the Lord their God.
 And I have seen some Dutch-maps, in their Scale, in
stead of miles, measured by days-journeys. A computation most un∣certain,
especially when it is not agreed, whether the day be in Summer,
or Winter; the traveller on horse-back, or on foot: not to speak of the
goodness, or plainness of the way, (by which advantage,
 
Ahimaaz
 beat

Cushi
) the speed and diligence of the traveller. For instance; 
Iacob
 being
in the prime of his youth, sole and single with God, and his staffe, tra∣velled
in a day from 
Beer-sheba
 to
 
Bethel,
 no less then sixty English
miles; a tough journey, and yet the wonder is lessened, if we observe,



1 No doubt, he set forth early (probably in the dark to prevent
discovery) and travelled till after 
the Sun
 was set.


2 He fled from his brother 
Esau;
 and fear makes good foot-men.


3 He went to fetch a wife; and so welcome an imployment made
him mend his pace.




Thus early up, and active in himself, and assisted by God, and driven
with fear, and drawn with love, and freed from any luggage; no won∣der,
if he went fast and far in a day. But the same 
Iacob,
 when he re∣turned
from 
Padan-Aram,
 bringing with him flocks, children, and the
impediments of a family, found
 fifteen miles from 
Mahanaim
 to 
Peniel
 (if
he went so far in one day) to be a sufficient journey. However, I deny not,
but perchance anciently, the foresaid 
paces, bow-shoots,
 and 
days-journeys

were reduced to a certain proportion, though now to us unknown.
And yet hence no imperfection in Scripture-History is justly inferred,
because the point is of no such concernment, and the holy Spirit inten∣ded
not exactness therein, as not important to the truth of the story.


§ 3. Come we now to their certain measures of ground:
 amongst
which the cubit challengeth the preheminence, as most common and
current in all 
Iudea,
 yea and in other eastern countreys. For we finde
even in 
Persia,
 that the gallowes provided by 
Haman
 for 
Mordecai
 (but
hanselled by himself) was fifty
 cubits high. Except any will say, this
was extraordinary, that in the greater scorn and derision, that the gal∣lows
might the better fit a 
Iews
 body, it was framed and fashioned ac∣cording
to a Jewish dimension. By cubits they were commanded, to
measure the suburbs and lands of the 
Levites,
 which were to 
reach from
the
 wall of the City, and outwards, a thousand cubits round about.
 Say not this
was a long and tedious work, to mete by so small a measure, God here∣by
shewing, that the least parcell of so fruitfull a land, was of conside∣
able
valuation.
Thus precious drugs are not weighed out by hundreds,


or pounds; but by drams, scruples, and graines; so soveraign is the
smallest particle thereof.


§ 4. A 
cubit
 (in the Hebrew 
,
 
Amah
) is so called from 
cubitus the
elbow
 (as that from 
cubo
 to lean, or 
 to bow) because properly the
space betwixt the elbow, and tip of the middle finger. It was two-fold,

the great,
 and 
the lesse,
 which may be cleared out of Scripture, against
such as levell all cubits alike, and conceive this distinction lyeth not in
the thing it self, but mens bare opinion. For, 2 
Chron.
 3. 3. we finde
cubits 
according to the first measure,
 and the Prophet
 expresly mentioneth

a full reed of six great cubits.
 The lesser cubit generally is adequate to our
foot and half, or half yard, the great double as much, commensurate to
our full yard or three foot. But 
Rabbi Cam
i
 in his comment on
 
Ezekiel

assignes the great cubit a larger proportion, so that a 
thousand Emoth,
 or
cubits make a mile, whom we have followed in laying out the bounds
of the 
Levites
 suburbs.


§ 5. Forbear we here to speak of 
fathoms,
 but once mentioned in
Scripture
 (and then in the 
Adriatick
 sea) because onely used to sound
the depth of water, nor measure the length of land. A 
furlong
 comes next
to be considered, so called 
quasi furrowlong,
 being so much as a teme in
England plougheth going forward, before they return back again. I say
in England, otherwise in the east parts of 
Poland,
 where Lords have large
lands in a continued champion-countrey, uninterrupted with inclo∣su
es,
they make but two 
urlongs (and those some miles in length) in
a whole day, the one going forth, the other coming back, so to save
time and toil of often turning. We finde no mention of furlongs in the
old Testament, and indeed the Grecian sheers first cut the land of 
Cana∣an

into the fashion of furlongs, after 
Alexander
 and the 
Asian
 Kings be∣came
Masters thereof. Hereupon we first meet with them in
 
Mac∣ca
ees,

which afterwards in the new Testament, became the constant
computation of distances, both by sea and land. Now although some
difference be in the dimension of severall 
urlongs, the 
Italian
 is conclu∣ded
to contain an hundred and five and twenty paces, and to be the
eight part of a mile.


§ 6. A mile consists of a thousand paces,
 whence in Latine it takes
its denomination, and is a measure of pure Roman extraction. How∣ever
some learned men conceive, that the Hebrew 
Berah,
 answereth to
the proportion of the Roman mile, and so (saith
 
Montanus
) is always
rendered by the 
Rabbins;
 namely, when 
Iacob
 is
 twice said, to 
want but
a Berah to come to Ephrath;
 and when 
Naaman
 is said, to have 
departed
 a
Berah from the Prophet Elisha.
 In all which places 
Tremelius
 hath it 
exiguum
terrae spatium,
 whom our translation following, readeth it, 
a little way.
 A
mile is said to contain eight furlongs, though others in these eastern
parts,

will have ten to concurre to the compleating thereof.


§ 7. But, be a mile more, or less; longer, or shorter; the sense, ra∣ther


then the sound, is to be heeded in our Saviours precept,
 
And who∣soever
shall compell thee to goe a mile, goe with him twain.
 Not that hereby he
meant to make Christians the lackeys to every mans insolence, but one∣ly
to beat down in them vindicative dispositions, to gain on their op∣pressours,
by submission, not violence, seeing resistance would invite
ruine upon them, during their present condition. Indeed, clothes are
straitest when first put on, which afterwards widen with wearing;
and so some think the strictness of this precept, was onely at the first
giving thereof. Yea, they compare this, and the like prudentiall coun∣sells,
rather then positive commands, to the shells of birds, which when
they are hatched fall off of their own accord, conceiving onely infant
Christianity obliged to the keeping thereof. Whereas an eternall tye is
therein contained; but, with what circumstances it is to be observed,
comes not within the 
Scale of miles
 in our Maps to determine.


§ 8. The 
Sabbath-days journey
 remaines,
 and great difference there is
amongst good authors about the proportion thereof. Some count it so
much as was betwixt each mans proper habitation, and the next Synago∣gue,
or place of publick worship, to which he was to repair; Others, that
distance, which one might goe after the 
Morning,
 and return before the

evening sacrifice was offered.
 But let us attend to the text which directs us
to some certainty therein;
 
Then returned they to Ierusalem from the mount
called Olivet, which is from Ierusalem a Sabbath-days journey.
 By the 
Mount
 here
we understand not the verge, or bottome; but the summity, top, or
ridge thereof, whence our Saviour made his ascension. Secondly, both
going thither, and returning thence are computed in the compass of the
journey. Now, 
Bethany
 which was on mount 
Olivet,
 is elsewhere said to
be 
nigh to Ierusalem
 
about fifteen furlongs,
 two miles on the matter; all which
put together, the result is, that four miles, or there-abouts, make up a

Sabbath-days journey.
 Provided, it was leasurely, and moderately paced,
coming under the notion rather of recreation, then toil; a walk, then
a work, both to man and beast; otherwise the day might be broken as
well in going too fast, as too far.


§ 9. It will here be demanded,
 seeing this was flatly against the letter
of the Law, (if not onely meant for the gathering of 
Manna
) positive,
and negative;
 
Abide yee every man in his place, let no man goe out of his place
on the seventh day:
 Whence then did this indulgence, or dispensation a∣rise?
Some ground it on 
Ioshua
's
 ordering, that the Ark should in its
removall be distanced from the people 
about two thousand cubits by mea∣sure;

which space is presumed, might be gone forward and backward
by any on the Sabbath-day without offence. But others conceive this
equity included in the very words of the Ordinance. For, surely God in∣tended
not, that the Sabbath should nail the 
Iews
 as fast to their houses
as the darkness did the 
Egyptians
 
when none arose from their place;
 seeing
such a sedentary stupidity had been a rack, not a rest; and a poor refresh∣ing


to the Jewish servants, that those who had been labourers six days,
should be prisoners the seventh. Some necessary motion therefore must
be allowed. And when the Disciples walked th
ough the corn on the

 Sabbath-day, the Pharisees found fault, not with their feet, but their
hands, not with their going, but gathering ears of corn as they went.
As for the 
Pars quota,
 how far people might goe on that day, custome
and tradition had decided it, about the days of our Saviour.


§ 10. For in the age of 
Elisha
 the nice restriction of a Sabbath-days
journey was unknown.
 For when the 
Shunamite
 requested of her hus∣band,

 
to send her one of the young men, and one of the asses, that she may run to
the man of God, and come again,
 he rejoyned, 
Wherefore wilt thou goe to him to day?
It is neither new Moon, nor▪ Sabbath.
 Intimating, that had it been Sabbath
either weekly or annuall, it was her duty, and had been her custome to
repair to the place where the Prophet lived; though 
Carmel,
 where 
Elisha

resided, was from 
Shunem
 at least fifteen miles. As for the 
Iews
 in our
Saviours time, they persisted in the rigorous observation of the Sab∣bath,
even till, and after the destruction of the Temple, insinuated in
our Saviours counsell,
 
Pray that your flight be not in winter, nor on the Sab∣bath-day.

Christ in the latter pitying that conflict, which would happen
in the scrupulous conscience of ceremonious 
Iews,
 betwixt their love of
saving their lives, and keeping the law; lest that, while the one spurred
them to fly, and the other bridled them to stay, they would be at such
a stand, that their enemies might easily knock them down in that
stound of amazement, and their life be determined in this world, before
the question decided in their conscience.


§ 11. As for latitudes and longitudes,
 the light and life of all great
Maps, we have onely observed them in our generall descriptions of

Palestine
 and 
Egypt,
 omitting them in the draughts of particular Tribes,
whose smalness render them incapable thereof, without very much
pains, and with very small profit. In the latitudes we may attain a tole∣rable
certainty, but so different are good Authors in assigning the longi∣tudes,
that they accord no better in their testimonies, then the witnesses
brought against Christ,
 
not any two of them agreeing together.
 Nor doth this
discord onely arise from the different meridians, whence the ancients and
moderns doe start their computations, because this being easily arbitra∣ted
according to just proportion, the difference almost remains as
much as ever before. However, we have followed authors of the best
authority, as
 hereafter God willing we shall give the Reader a particu∣lar
account thereof.








CHAP. 14. Directions for the use of the Scale of miles in our Maps.


§ 1. WIthout a 
Scale of miles,
 (or degrees equivalent) the livelyest
draught of a Countrey is no regulated Map, but a paper
full of names of places. However, vast is the difference betwixt the miles
in severall Countreys. An 
Italian
 mile containeth seven, an 
English

eight furlongs. A 
French
 is equall to two, a 
vulgar Dutch
 to three 
English

miles, the 
large Dutch
 to four, the miles in 
Swizerland
 to five, not to say six
of our 
English
 computation: so that, in that mountainous countrey, tra∣vellers
have a double disheartning, the worst of ways, and longest of
miles. Yea upon the Alpes in the juncture of 
Germany
 and 
Italy,
 in the
self same mountain, on the north side the miles are the longest, on the
south side the shortest in Christendome.


§ 2. Come over into 
England,
 and what difference is there betwixt a

Middlesex
 and a 
Yorkshire
 mile? The former the shortest, because (as some
will have it) every London-Lady when weary with walking, concludes
the space though never so short to be a mile: whilest the well moun∣ted

Rank-riders
 in the northern countrey, insensible of the length of the
way, because of the swiftness of their horses, make miles of the largest
proportion. Our scale of miles presented in all these Maps, is according
to the 
English
 mile containing eight furlongs; to which we have redu∣ced
(a task rather troublesome then difficult) the measures of other
authours, giving allowance according to the standards of the severall
countreys whereof they were.


§ 3. Here (if my complaint might finde any pity, and that pity give me
any ease) I would complain of the irreconcileable difference betwixt Au∣thors
(proceeding on one and the same scale of miles) in making their
distances betwixt their severall places. We read of 
Saul
 that he so scatte∣red
the army of the 
Ammonites
 so that
 
two of them were not lest together▪

Such a dispersion we finde in the judgment of learned men, not two of
them generally concurring in the measuring of miles betwixt eminent
places.


§ 4. Now as Jurie-men, when severall witnesses swear point-blank
one against another, make bold to beleeve his testimony who appears
most credible unto them, such power we have assumed to our selves in
these differences, to follow those, who we conceive have the best autho∣rity.
Herein having a speciall regard to those that lived upon the place,
and preferring their judgments above others, though otherwise of grea∣ter
learning, because in 
matters of fact
 done in his presence, the eyes of a
child are to be beleeved before the eares of a man.


§ 5. Where both authours appear of equall authority in themselves,
and number of followers, we have umpired the difference by pitching


on a middle number betwixt both. For instance,
 
Seiglerus
 makes it
fourteen thousand paces or fourteen miles betwixt 
Zidon
 and 
Tyre
 (emi∣nent
Marts, and therefore the distance betwixt them might be notorious∣ly
known) whilst
 
Vadianus
 makes it two hundred furlongs, or twenty
miles. Here to part the difference equall, we have insisted on 17 miles.


§ 6. However when this, and much more caution is used by us,
our Scale of miles is so farre from pretending to the exactness of
those left-handed 
Gibeonites
 to hit the mark at an haires-breadth and not misse,

that a large and charitable latitude must still be allowed us in a subject so
hard and full of uncertainty. Yea the holy Spirit it self speaks not po∣sitively
of distances of places, but with words of qualification.
 
About
threescore furlongs from Ierusalem to Emmaus;
 About five and twenty or thirty fur∣longs
they had rowed on the Sea;
 as if five in thirty made no considerable
difference. If the same favour may be but allowed our scale of miles,
I doubt not but it will acquit it self against all just exception.


§ 7. Now for the further managing of our 
Scale of miles
 we request
the Reader not to extend it, therewith to measure all the properties, or
History-pictures in our Map (for then some men would appear Giants,
yea monsters, many miles long) expecting him rather to carry a scale in
his own eyes, for surveying such portraitures. Yea in generall I undertake
nothing in defence or excuse of those pictures, to be done according to
the rule of Art, as none of my work, ornamentall, not essentiall to the
Maps: onely this I will say, that eminency in English Gravers, is not to
be expected till their Art be more countenanced and encouraged. Nor
would I have the Scale applied to Cities drawn in Prospective, as to

Rabbah
 in the Tribe of 
Gad
 &c. which then will fall out bigger then in∣deed
they were; desiring the Reader onely to understand them to be
fair and populous Cities, and therefore made more large and conspicu∣ous
then the rest.


§ 8. Such Towns as stand (as one may say) on tiptoes,
 on the ve∣ry

umstroke,
 or on any part of the utmost line of any Map (unresolved in
a manner to stay out or come in) are not to be presum'd placed accor∣ding
to exactness, but onely signifie them there, or thereabouts. Nor is
this without precedents in the best Geographers, so in their maps to make
the generall continuation of neighbouring countreys clearer thereby.


§ 9. If any difference,
 on accurate comparing, arise in the distances be∣twixt
the same places presented in severall Maps, (some such will escape in
defiance of all diligence) we hope the same will appear inconsiderable, &
such moats (not being before the sight, but in the corner of the eye) will lit∣tle,
if at all, hinder the light of a Geographical truth. Surely as in the strictest
laws of Horse-racers, some 
wast of weight
 is allowed to the Riders: so me
thinks some favour ought to be afforded an Author, in measuring and
making many Maps, were it but for the shaking of his weary hand in
so tedious a work. But if such differences appear somewhat great, let


those be relied on as the truest, where such places are set down 
datâ
operâ, of set purpose;
 so that it is 
the very work
 of that Map to describe them:
let those I say be credited before the distances in other Maps, where such
places come in onely of 
complement,
 or are brought in by the by, to fashi∣on
and fill up the (otherwise empty) borders thereof.






CHAP. 15. How the different qualities of places in our Maps, are distinguished by their se∣verall
Characters.


§ 1. MAy the Reader be pleased to learn the language of the severall
Characters of the places used in our Map,
 which speak
much in little, and are very usefull for the clearing of the history.




1 All Cities markt with Coronets were anciently the Royall seats
of the thirty one Kings of 
Canaan,
 at and before the time of 
Ioshua


2 All Cities surrounded with double circles (the reason whereof
hereafter) belong to the Tribe of 
Levi.


3 All Cities having banners or flags placed upon them, shew
the conjecturall position thereof, when we have no assurance
of their exact situation. One side of which flags humbly con∣fesseth
our want of certainty, the other as earnestly craveth bet∣ter
information.


4 When places are noted with Asterisks it imports difference of
Divines, some making them proper names, others meerly ap∣pellative.


5 Places which have both flags and Asterisks upon them, are as
I may say doublehatcht with uncertainty, not onely their posi∣tion
being doubtfull, but it is questionable whether they be pro∣per
names or no.


6 Places mentioned onely in the Apocrypha are signed with a Cre∣scent
or half-moon inverted,
 in some allusion to the difference of
Armes of younger brethren, such books being accounted of
the Fathers but of a second rank, and reputed but 
Deutero-canoni∣call

by learned Romanists. Say not that a 
Barre of bastardy
 better
befitted them being taken out of Apocrypha writings. For what
though those writings were never penned by Prophets (of
whom none betwixt 
Malachi
 and 
Iohn
 the 
Baptist
) never written
in Hebrew, never owned by the 
Iews,
 Gods people, for Canoni∣call,

to whom the oracles of God
 were committed,
 (and, which is mainly
materiall, Christ reproved them not for this neglect) never pro∣phesied
of Christ 
to
 whom all the Prophets beare witness,
 never so∣lemnly
quoted by Christ and his Apostles; yet because ancient,
and because it may be said of them as of 
Abijah
 the sonne of



Ieroboam,
 
in them there is found sone good thing toward the Lord,
 they
deserve from unprejudic'd judgments a reverent respect.


7 Places noted with 
 cross in a circle, are such whereof no men∣tion
in Scripture, but onely in humane writers, 
Iosephus, Pliny,

and the like.


8 Such as have on them an half-moon with the points upward
are modern places in the possession of the Turk.




Of these very few, and those either of high note in themselves, or be∣cause
seated on high rodes. We confess these no essentiall part, but con∣ceive
them a fit copartment for our subject in hand. And thus among
the flock of cities in our Map, by looking on their brand, their owner
and nature are quickly known.


§ 2. Some will conceive these had better been thrown together with∣out
any distinction, seeing the learned doe not need, and the unlearned
will not heed the differences aforesaid. However we had rather offend
on the right hand, and be censured for overmuch caution. Others will
adjudge it fitter, that the severall towns had been set forth in sundry
maps, not 
putting the new piece to the old so to make the rent the worse,
 not min∣gling
modern with ancient places, but presenting them apart in entire
descriptions. But this being a matter of great expence, we leave such
mens judgments to be rectified by their purses, when they seriously con∣sider
the price thereof.


§ 3. And now what remaineth, but that we humbly beg 
a measuring
reed out of the Sanctuary
 to be lent us, that so by heavens assistance we
may be enabled to perform this survey of the land of 
Canaan?
 This in the
first place implored, we proceed to our task. It was Saint 
Pauls
 advice
to the 
Corinthians,
 Be yee followers of me, as I am of Christ:
 my humble re∣quest
to the reader is, that while I goe before him in this my description,
he would follow me in his own pace, at his own pleasure, so fast, and
so far as I follow the truth, at least the most probability grounded on
Scripture, ancient Authors, and modern Travellers who have been eye∣witnesses
of the countrey.




Finis Libri primi.










To the Right Honourable
HENRY
LORD BEAVCHAMPE,
Son to the Right Honourable
WILLIAM
MARQUES OF HARTFORD.


MY LORD,


A
Mongst many other meditations, my
serious thoughts have made en∣quiry,
concerning 
Government
 and

Nobility,
 whence each of them de∣rived
their originall.


For the first, I finde it as ancient
as 
Man,
 and extracted from 
God

himself. Who because he was a 
Spirit,
 (and therefore invi∣sible)
the better to try what Tribute of obedience, Men out of

Conscience
 would pay unto him, stamped a 
character of do∣minion,



as his own visible Image (in the infancy of man∣kind)
on the 
Father of the family,
 that so honour and duty
might be given to 
God
 in yeelding subjection to him who
represented him. These first 
Governours
 were termed 
Patri∣arches,

that is, 
Father-Princes,
 their compounded name,
speaking their mixt authority. And
 
Josephus
 writing of the
death of 
Methuselah,
 saith 
, 
He left,
 or

passed over his principality to
 Lamech 
his son;
 and this

Prince-ship
 continued in the 
Primogeniture
 for many Ages,
till the method thereof was discomposed, partly by the nume∣rosity
of mankinde, partly by their far dispersed habitations.


Thus was 
Government
 the 
Mistresse,
 first born in the
world, whilest 
Nobility
 her 
Maide
 came in not long after to
attend her. For such 
Persons,
 whose vertuous dispositions
commended them to the speciall favour of 
Princes in Power,

had in reward of their worth; 
markes of Honour
 fixed upon
them: which afterward by succession descended unto their
posterity.


Of these, some imitating their 
Ancestours
 goodness, conti∣nued
in the splendor of their 
Nobility,
 whilest others degene∣rating
by their vicious courses, invited neglect and contempt
upon themselves. Insomuch that in some the 
valour
 and 
spirit
 of
their 
Progenitors
 (which advanced them by the 
sword
 in time
of 
war
) evaporated all into empty aire; turning into a 
wild
 and

riotous animosity;
 And in others, the gravity and wisdome
of their Grandfathers (which promoted them by the 
Gown

in the days of 
Peace
) settleth into feculent earth, leaving no∣thing
but a 
tame and unactive stupidity
 behinde it.


Herethe 
Nobility
 of such had expired, save that some of them
seasonably perceiving the desperate 
Consumption
 thereof


did follow the prescription of 
Physick,
 and returned into the

Native aire
 which first gave Honour her birth and being;
and did so repair their lost reputation by practising the Primi∣tive
vertues of 
Piety, Courtesie, Hospitality; Valour,
Wisdome,
 and 
Learning;
 thus going home to the 
Climate

wherein Nobility was first conceived.


But thanks be to God, your Lordship is none of those
personally guilty of any decay of dignity; whose vertues pre∣serve
your Honour in the perfect health and strength thereof,
which hath been the main motive to make me so desirous to
present my book to your Honour, as a proper Patron, even to the
height, for all purposes and intents. Whose Iudgment can ex∣amine
the whole, Clemency Pardon what is amiss, and Great∣ness
Protect the rest in defiance of opposition.


Indeed Sir, besides desire to shelter my self under your Pa∣tronage,
gratitude obligeth me to tender my service to your
Honour. For all my Books, being my 
nether and upper
milstone,
 (and such by the Leviticall Law, might not be

taken to pledge,
 because a 
Mans
 life
) without which I had
been rendered unable to 
grinde any Grist
 for the good of my
self or others, had been taken from me in these civill wars, had
not a Letter from your 
Lady-mother
 preserved the greatest
part thereof. Good reason therefore that the first handfull of
my 
finest meale
 should be presented in thankfulness to your
family.


And now my Lord, bethinking my self of a blessing for your
self and worthy Lady, that she-pattern of Meekness, Modesty
Piety, and Patience; no fitter can be found then what the
Psalmist pronounceth, that you may 
see your childrens
children, and
 Peace upon Israel.
 Here is the 
finest of


wares,
 and withall the 
largest of measures, length of days,

to enjoy them. Well may this prayer be read at 
Marriages,

there being a 
marriage
 in the Prayer, wherein 
Long-life

coupleth 
Posterity
 and 
Peace
 together. Otherwise it is wofull
to 
multiply
 for war to 
subtract;
 and onely to be fruitfull
for the 
Sword
 or 
Famine.
 May this Benediction of the
Psalmist light on you and yours in the highest performance
thereof: which is the desire of


Your Lordships
most humble servant
THO. FULLER.






Here followeth the Map of 
Reuben.
















THE TRIBE OF REVBEN. The second Book.


§ 1. 
REuben
 eldest Son of 
Iacob
 by 
Leah,
 forfeited his
Birthright by
 defiling his Fathers bed. For which
fact he was cursed,
 that 
he should not excell.
 Where∣upon
came such a dearth of eminent Persons
of this Tribe, that neither King, Judge, Priest,
nor Prophet descended thereof. Yea, few men of
fame, onely two notoriously infamous,
 
Dathan
 and 
Abiram,
 Generalls of
the mutineers against 
Moses:
 haply in hope, because of their extraction,
to recover the lost Birthright unto their Tribe. Yet these 
Reubenites,
 though
not springing high, spread broad; little puissant, very populous, coun∣ting
no fewer then forty six
 thousand five hundred at the generall
muster in mount 
Sinai:
 all which dying in the wilderness for their infi∣delity,
their children descended
 from them, being forty three thousand,
seven hundred and thirty, possessed this land, east of 
Iordan.


§ 2. A land, that five times exchanged her owners in the old Testa∣ment.
First, her originall inhabitants were the
 
Emims,
 a younger house
of the 
Anakims:
 accounted Giants, being great in stature and many in
number. Secondly, 
Moabites,
 who, though less and lower, yet advanta∣ged
by divine
 assistance, did overtop and overcome these voluminous

Emims,
 and possessed themselves of their land. Thirdly, 
Amorites,
 under

Sihon
 their King who (somewhat before 
Moses
 conducted the 
Israelites

hither) acquired the soveraignty of this countrey,
 beating out the

Moabites,
 and banishing them south of 
Arnon.
 Fourthly, 
Reubenites:
 on
whom 
Moses
 bestowed it, after 
Sihon
 was conquered and killed. Fifthly,

Moabites
 again. For it seems after the captivity of the 
Reubenites
 by 
Tilgath
Pilneser 1 Chron.
 5. 26. they made a re-entry on their old possessions:
seeing those cities (formerly inhabited by the 
Reubenites
) are propheci∣ed
against by
 
Isaiah
 and 
Ieremiah,
 under the notion of places belonging
to the people of 
Moab,
 to be destroied by 
Shalmaneser,
 and 
Nabuchad∣nezzar.



§ 3. This Countrey had 
Iordan
 on the west, (dividing it from 
Ephra∣im

and 
Benjamin
) the River 
Arnon
 on the east and south (parting it from
the kingdome of 
Moab
) and on the north confined on the Tribe of 
Gad.

The extent thereof from east to west may be allowed forty two miles,
not exceeding thirty five from north to south. A Countrey excellent
for grazing, not as if defective in corn and wine, wherein it shared with
the rest of the Tribes, (besides the benefits of some Mineralls, and me∣dicinall
waters, whereof in due place) but because exceeding in con∣veniencies
for Cattell:
 Pastures to feed, Woods to shade, and Rivers to
wate
 them. Therefore was it bestowed upon the Tribes of 
Reuben,
Gad,
 and 
half Manasseh,
 which much abounded in cattell. In which three
we may observe some shadowes of Primogeniture, (which might im∣bolden
them to petition to be first served) 
Reuben
 the eldest of 
Iacob
 by
his wife; 
Gad
 eldest by 
Zilpah
 his concubine, and 
Manasseh
 first born
of 
Ioseph.
 But these Tribes as first planted were first plucked up. God car∣ved
unto them the first cut of the Land, and after called for the 
Voider
 to
take it first from them. For they falling from the house of 
David,
 and
following 
Ieroboam
 through rebellion to Idolatry, and not being warned
with the terrible blow
 
Hazael
 gave them, shroudly shrubbing their
branches, God rent them up by the roots in the days of
 
Pekah,
 by the
hand of
 
Tilgath-Pilneser
 King of 
Assyria;
 some twenty years before the
generall captivity of their brethren, at the end of the reign of 
Hosheah,
2 Kings 17. 6.


§ 4 Leaving the people, come we to survey the places, and memo∣rable
actions in this Tribe. In the north
east corner thereof, near the
banks of 
Arnon,
 we finde the tract or territory of 
Aroer.
 For though 
Aroer

the City was undoubtedly entire in the Tribe of 
Gad;
 yet it
 plainly
appears, that at least a 
Moity
 of the countrey adjacent (so called from the
city) was possessed by the 
Reubenites.
 A populous place it was, the
 Pro∣phet
mentioning the cities of 
Aroer,
 though their names or number is
not expressed. Probably 
Arnon
 one of the principall, 
Tell yee it in Arnon

(
 says 
Ieremy:
) surely not to the fishes in the River, but to a City seated
on the brink thereof, and thence denominated: as 
Hull
 in 
York-shire,
 so
commonly called from the Rivolet running by it.


§ 5. Going south-west, having the stream of 
Arnon
 for our guide, we
leave 
Kedemoth,
 not far from the north bank thereof. The 
Septuagin
 read

Kedson
 for 
Kedemoth,
 and the Vulgar, without any warrant, read 
Iethson

for 
Kedson:
 so procreative is one errour of another. This 
Kedemoth
 was

 one of the four Peculiars of the 
Levites,
 wherein they were accommoda∣ted
with Safety, Pleasure, and Profit. Safety, in the City it self, within
whose walls they dwelt in secure habitations: Pleasure in their suburbs,

reaching a
 
thousand Cubits
 from the wall round about, (little less then an
English mile) where they had houses of retirement, with stalls and
stables for their cattell: Profit in their glebe land, extending two thou∣sand


Cubits from their suburbs on every side, improved for pasture,
tillage and vineyards. For thus the survey of the 
Levites
 lands, 
Numb.
 35.
4, 5. (though the difficult place is capable of severall senses) is ex∣pounded
by learned 
Rabbi Maimonie,
 and we in our Maps have described
them accordingly. Now though herein we have given the 
Levites
 lands
the largest and most favourable bounds (seeing I am unable to endow
them, they shall lose nothing by my restrictive measuring thereof) yet
know that narrower limits are assigned them by 
Tremellius,
 as shall
hereafter be presented in
 Diagram we have prepared for that pur∣pose.


§ 6. Behold here 
Levi's
 curse turned into a blessing,
 
Divide them in
Iacob, and scatter them in Israel.
 Now the 
dividing
 of them proved the 
dispo∣sing

of them, for their own and others advantage. Their 
scattering
 was
their 
ranking
 for the best behoof of the people, for whose instruction
they were intended. They were the 
Salt of the earth,
 and therefore God
sprinkled them here and there, the more conveniently to season the
whole nation. Insomuch that some English Parishes are more remote
from their Mother-church, then most places in 
Canaan
 were distant
from the Cities of the 
Levites.
 We must not forget that in 
Ieroboams
 aposta∣sie,
the religious 
Levites
 forsook their Cities and
 fled to 
Ierusalem,
 pre∣ferring
voluntary exile before wealthy homes, on the condition of an
Idolatrous compliance. It appears not in Scripture, how these Cities
and lands thus left were disposed of. Whether 
Ieroboam
 himself seised
on them, converting them into demeans of his Crown, or whether he
suffered them to revert to those respective Tribes, from whom they were
taken: so fastning his subjects affections unto him with nailes of gold of
their own profit. Either course may be conceived a cause to hasten the
captivity of the people; it being just that those, who swallow Gods
morsels, should be spewed out of their own possessions.


§ 7. Round about this City, is the wilderness of 
Kedemoth,
 not
wholly abandoned to solitariness, but as the rest of this kinde, more
thinly inhabited. It abounded with wild beasts, Lions, Bears, Bores,
Wolves, Foxes, where the pleasure in hunting the game, did not recom∣pense
the pains and dangers of the shepheards lying constant Perdues
in defence of their flocks. From this wilderness, 
Moses
 sent messengers
to
 
Sihon
 King of the 
Amorites,
 for peaceable passage through his coun∣trey.
But 
Sihon
 (path-wise and land-foolish) by denying a civility,
drew destruction on himself and subjects. For seeking in fight to tra∣verse
it, for their 
pedibus ambulando,
 he was by a 
firme Ejection
 outed of his
whole kingdome.


§ 8. To return to 
Arnon.
 Hereabouts the children of 
Israel
 passed o∣ver
it, miraculously 
with dry feet,
 saith
 
Adricomius.
 But the miracle seems
rather of his, then Gods making, the Scripture being silent therein,
and the river not of that depth or breadth, but that it was fordable, espe∣cially


with the help of Camels, Mules, and Asses. Many miles hence
this river solitarily runs on as sensible of its sad fate suddenly to fall into
the 
dead-Sea,
 at 
Ashdoth-pisgah.
 Where all his comfort is, to have the com∣pany
of two other Brooks: whereof the eastermost runs near to
 
Betzar

or 
Bozra:
 A City of refuge belonging to the 
Levites Merarites,
 whereof
there were six in the whole Countrey of 
Canaan,
 with a
 provision that
they should adde three more (mans mercy must increase proportiona∣bly
with his means) if God enlarged their coast; though we read of no
such addition, either in 
Davids
 or 
Solomons
 time. The Cities were so con∣veniently
distanced by Gods appointment, that in half a day (men for
their lives will take wide and thick strides) some one of them might
be recovered from the remotest corner of the land. Let Historians relate
the Laws of such Sanctuaries, whereof these most fundamentall.




1
t
.
 Strangers and sojourners in 
Israel
 were capable of the privi∣ledge
thereof, as well as native 
Iews.


2
ly
. Any murderer that could, might fly thither without any hin∣drance
or interruption;
 
Thou shalt prepare thee a way:
 Otherwise
such obstructions would have frustrated, and defeated the main
intent of such priviledged places.


3
ly
. If the murderer could but reach the
 border of such cities of re∣fuge
(the very hemme of Christs garment had soveraign ver∣tue
in it) distant as is aforesaid from the City it self, it was a suf∣ficient
protection for him till his cause was examined before the
Judges.


4
ly
. Upon examination, those were denied the benefit of refuge,
and
 delivered up to Justice, who had committed murder out
of 
malice prepense,
 or had killed one (as we may say) with a mali∣cious
weapon: namely, if the bigness or sharpness thereof, be
it
 iron, wood or stone, was mortall in view, carried death in
the sight thereof, as probable, enforced with ones hand, to kill
a man.


5
ly
. Others, who casually had killed their neighbour, might live
safely in the City, till the death of the High-priest: typifying the
suffering of our Saviour, whose execution is our gaol-delivery.


6
ly
. If the murderer
 wandring out of the suburbs, was found by
the avenger of bloud, he forfeited his protection, and might be
killed with indemnity.


7
ly
. After the High-priests death (say the
 
Rabbines
 without Express
from Scripture) the party was remitted to his innocence, not
honour; restored to his liberty, not lustre; clouded the remnant
of his life, 
because of the scandall that came by his hand.




Forget we not here, that besides these six Cities, the
 Altar in the Tabernacle or Temple, was reputed the seventh and paramount place
of murderers protection.



§ 9. The brook from the west, begins at 
Machaerus:
 one of the stron∣gest
inland Forts in the world, nature having prevented Art therein, so im∣pregnable
is the City and Castle upon the top of a steep
 hill, with a
deep valley round about. Hither
 
Iosephus
 saith, 
Herod
 the 
Tetrarch
 sent

Iohn the Baptist
 to be beheaded. For which fact, his great army was af
terwards
overthrown by 
Aretas
 King of 
Arabia.
 Hereabout,
 two springs
arise of contrary natures. One hot and sweet, the other cold and bitter.
Both which meeting together make a most excellent Bath, cordiall for
severall diseases. As if nature thereby would lesson us, that moderation,
wherein extremities agree, is the best cure for all distempers. These wa∣ters
are approved excellent for the contraction of the nerves, either in∣wardly
taken, or outwarldly applied. 
Herod
 the King being sick, (new∣ly
come out of a Bath of bloud, of the innocent 
Bethlehem-babes
) was hi∣ther
directed in vain by his Physitians, the water refusing to be guilty
of such a Tyrants recovery. On this stream stood
 
Lasha
 mentioned

Genesis
 10. 19. afterwards called 
Callirrhoe
 or the 
Fair stream.
 And now
what pity is it that such percious water should presently be spilt into the
the 
Dead Sea!
 But what remedy? Fair and foul faces must meet together
in the grave.


§ 10. As for the 
Dead sea,
 which onely peeps into a corner of this
Tribe, but stedfastly faceth a whole side of 
Iudah
 more properly thereof
hereafter. And as for 
Iosephus
 his valley of
 
Baaras,
 with the strange
growing, gathering, & working of the famous root therein, we mention
it, not to seem wholly ignorant thereof; and but mention it, not to seem
over credulous therein. Hereabouts is plenty of Alum and Brimstone, the
latter probably some stragling drops of that direfull shower, which was
rained on 
Sodome,
 and 
Gomorrah,
 leaving some tincture in the adjacent
Countrey as a remembrancer of so great a Judgment.


§ 11. It is now high time that we survey the west of this Tribe,
which 
Iordan
 (as we have said) divideth from 
Ephraim,
 and 
Benjamin.

This is the true meaning of 
Deborah's
 complaint, uttered and repeated,

for
 the divisions of Reuben were great thoughts of heart,
 namely because that
Tribe separated by 
Iordan
 from the western continent of 
Canaan,
 could
not come seasonably to the succour of 
Barak,
 and subduing of 
Sisera.

This River used to overflow all his banks in the first moneth. 1 
Chron.

12. 15. (parallel to the end of our 
March,
 and beginning of 
Aprill
) or,
as it is said 
Iosh. 3. 15. at the time of harvest.
 Which vast distance in our
English Climate (as much as betwixt Spring and Autumn) is easily
reconciled and made to meet in 
Iudea;
 where the 
Harvest 
t large
 is da∣ted
from the 
first fruits,
 and those ripe in 
Aprill
 in that hot countrey. Let
Naturalists discuss the cause, whence this inundation of 
Iordan
 pro∣ceeds;
whether from the violence of winds, then blowing on its stream,
and angring it beyond his banks; or from the influence of the Moon,
Commandress over moist bodies, and their motions; or from the con∣fluence


of Snow dissolved from the mountains. But my discourse like

Iordan
 overflowes, it shall return within its banks.


§ 12. In the northwest corner of this Tribe, 
Iordan
 first entring into
it, is fordeable at 
Bethbara
 or 
Bethabara,
 that is, 
the house of passage.
 For

Gideon
 having the 
Midianites
 in chace, sent messengers to all in mount

Ephraim,
 (a service most proper for them, cause in their confines) 
to

 take before them the water unto Bethbara and Iordan,
 which there with good
guides and high Camels might be waded over; but more southward the
river is fenced by its own breadth and depth against all Passengers. And
here afterward did
 
Iohn
 baptize our 
Saviour.
 As for
 
Aphek
 hard by, we
place it here rather in conformity to
 others, then convinced in our
own judgment of the true situation thereof.


§ 13. The altar 
Ed,
 or 
witnesse,
 was hereabouts erected by the 
Reube∣nites,
Gadites,
 and half Tribe of 
Manasseh,
 returning from the conquest of

Canaan.
 This Altar was a bridge in effect, to conjoin these divided
Tribes with the rest; severed by water, the same in worship; on the
other side 
Iordan
 in position, on the same side with the other Tribes in
Religion. But though there was a noon-day of Innocence in their inten∣tions,
yet because (though not a night of guiltiness) a twilight of su∣spicion
obscured their actions, it occasioned jealousies in their brethren,
as if they had hatched some idolatrous designe. But when the matter
came to be disputed in a military way, the controversie was ended by
the right stating of the question, and a seasonable distinction well ap∣plied,
that it was an Altar onely of memoriall, and
 not for any burnt
meat or Peace-offering. O that all differences between brethren might
winde off, in so welcome a conclusion!


§ 14. And now he that shall cast his eye over the Plain on the east
of 
Iordan,
 shall finde it well stockt with multitudes of goodly sheep,
which caused 
Deborah's
 expostulation, 
Why abodest thou Reuben amongst
the sheepfolds, to heare the bleating of the flockes?
 And yet no wonder if he
preferred such musick, before the clashing of swords, and sounding of
trumpets in the battail against the 
Canaanites:
 seeing naturally men
chuse profitable ease, before honourable danger. The tails of those
sheep, both for fat and wooll, were incredibly great, some of them a

 Cubit long. So that nature who hath tyed the tails to other creatures,
may seem to have tyed the 
Syrian
 sheep to their tails, which with great
difficulty they drag after them. This is the reason, why it is expresly
commanded in the law, that when a sheep is sacrificed for a 
Peace-offer∣ing,

the fat thereof and the whole
 tail (not observed in 
Kine,
 or 
Goats
)
taken off hard by the 
backbone
 was to be offered: that part being for
bulk and value considerable in their sheep, which is contemptible in
other creatures.


§ 15. To goe back to the 
River,
 having left that place behind us,
where the
 Ferry-boat passed over to carry 
David
 and his houshold,


after his conquest of 
Absalom.
 We are now arrived at that memorable place,
where God magnified 
Ioshua,
 heartened his own people, and shrivelled
up the hearts of their enemies, by drying up the waters of 
Iordan,
 whilest
the 
Israelites
 passed over in this admirable Equipage.




1 The 
Priests
 went into the river bearing the Ark; in homage
whereunto 
Iordan
 reverently retreated; (very farre from the

river Adam,
 which is besides 
Zaretan
) and they stood on firm
ground in the
 midst thereof, till all the 
Israelites
 were passed
over.


2 
Reuben, Gad,
 and 
half Manasseh
 led the 
Van,
 about
 forty thousand
men of Armes, the residue of them (in all about
 an hundred thousand) remaining at home to husband their ground, guard
their houses, govern their families.


3 After them the other Tribes followed: and it is observed 
that
they
 hasted,
 not with a distrustfull haste (as suspicious that the
returning waters might drown the hindmost of them) but an
industrious speed, and mannerly quickness, as not willing to
make God wait upon them in continuing a Miracle longer then
necessity did require.


4 When all were over, the 
Priests
 with the 
Ark,
 who first entred,
last left the water, (all dangerous designes are begun and finished
by Gods assistance) and then 
Iordan,
 whose streams hitherto
suspended, returned into his channell.


5 A duplicate or double monument was erected to perpetuate the
memory hereof, being a 
Grand Iury
 of great stones. Of these,
twelve were solemnely set up on the land in the Tribe of 
Ben∣jamin

at 
Gilgal,
 and the other twelve (the counterpart of this
deed) were left in the midst of the river.




Some perchance may admire that 
Ioshua
 should set this latter invisible
monument, in a place where it is drowned both in water and obscurity.
But this 
River-mark
 was such, as possibly the tops of the stones might
appear at low water; or if wholly hidden, and dangerous for boats to
approach, the 
ailers constant care to avoid them in their passage, called
the occasion of placing them there to their daily remembrance.


§ 16. We must not dissemble the difference betwixt Authors, about
the situation of the aforesaid City of 
Adam,
 but once mentioned in Scri∣pture,
and therefore (as the Hebrews have a Proverb of words but once
named, 
that they have no kindred and alliance
) more difficult to know the
true posture thereof. The best is, this 
Adam,
 though having no kindred
hath some company to notifie it; 
Adam besides Zaretan:
 and one 
Zaretan

is sufficiently known to have been in the half Tribe of 
Manasseh
 west of

Iordan,
 not far from the sea of 
Galilee.
 Hence learned
 
Masius
 concludes,
that the waters of 
Iordan
 were cut off, full seventy miles together, north
of the peoples passage over it. To which opinion, under favour, we


can in no wise consent. Conceiving rather that just against 
Iericho,
 the
river was dried up, for whereas the station of 
Iordan
 was most wonder∣full,
the 
Israelites
 had lost all the sight of this wonder on their right side,
if done out of distance so many miles from their view. Place we there∣fore
on these reasons (and the
 example of others) both 
Adam
 and 
Za∣retan

in the Tribe of 
Reuben.


§ 17. Some difference also there is betwixt Divines concerning the
latitude of their passage over the river: Some conceiving it onely to a∣mount
to the proportion of a fair alley, lane, or path of such receit alone
as admitted the 
Israelites
 in a full and free march a competent number a
brest, and that the waters, as in the 
Red sea,
 standing still on both sides,

 
were a wall to them on the right hand and on the left,
 as the Graver in our Map
hath designed it. Others doe not onely make a gap, through 
Iordan,
 but
pluck down the whole hedge thereof, maintaining that all the water of
that river on the left hand, (betwixt their passage over, and the 
Dead sea)
failed and were cut off, or dried up.
 Which latter opinion is most agreeable
to
 Scripture, and reason: for seeing the stream of 
Iordan
 south of their
going over, was not supplied with any reciprocall or refluous tide out
of the 
Dead sea,
 the stopping of the waters above must necessarily com∣mand
their defection beneath, and that the channell by consequence
for the time being was dried up.


§ 18. 
Iordan,
 having now closed his streams together, runs by 
Livias,

a City which 
Herod
 built, and so named, in honour of 
Livia
 the Mother
of 
Tiberius Caesar.
 For to enfavour themselves with the Emperour, the
Jewish Kings called many Cities by their names 
(Augusta, Tiberias,
 two

Cesarea's, Iulias, Livias
) as if 
Palestine
 had been a Register book of the
Imperiall Roman family.


§ 19. Let us now take an account of the inland Parts of this Tribe,
and return to the place where the 
Israelites
 passed over 
Arnon.
 Betwixt

Egypt
 and 
Arnon
 they had forty severall stations, and then entred into the

Promised land.
 In comemoration whereof, probably God did order,
that an offender should receive but 
forty stripes
 (what Judge soever
counts them too few, would think thirty too many, if he felt them him∣self)
and then be freed from further punishment. Coming into 
Ca∣naan,

their one and forty 
and first fixing there
 was at the foot of mount

Abarim,
 and edge of the wilderness of 
Ked
moth.
 Hence they removed to

Abelshittim,
 where 
Deuteronomie
 was made, the second Edition of the
Law revised, and enlarged by God, the Author thereof. Here the peo∣ple
of 
Israel
 were numbred the second time. And although some parti∣cular
Tribes were encreased, amongst whom those three that pitched
on the east side of the Tabernacle, 
Iudah, Issachar,
 and 
Zebulun,
 (God and
the rising Sun make any thing fruitfull) yet in the whole, they were
diminished
 one thousand eight hundred and twenty. Let such, as ad∣mire
hereat, that people being in slavery should multiply more then
when they were at liberty, consider,





1 Some Plants, 
(Palme trees
 and 
Camomile
) the more deprest, the
further they expand themselves.


2 Infant Nations, like infants, grow more discernibly at the first,
then when they approach their full stature.


3 God purposely to defeat the designe of 
Pharaoh,
 to destroy the

Israelites,
 blessed them with transcendent fruitfulness.


4 The breeders in the wilderness, were visited with many casual∣ties,
bringing them to untimely ends; whereas all those in 
Egypt,

though painfull in their livings, were healthfull in their lives.




But the most memorable Accident in this place, was the Idolatry of
the 
Israelites
 to 
Baal-peor
 an 
Idoll,
 conceived by most learned men to be

Priapus.
 And who could worship him with piety, whom none with
modesty can describe? It seems that 
Moab
 and 
Midian
 (perceiving 
S
hon

King of the 
Amorites
 overthrown in battell) counterfeited amity with
them, and pretending to shew them (being strangers) the courtesie of
the countrey, made them an entertainment, which could not be court∣like
and compleat without the company of their women. The 
Israelites

beholding the 
Midianitish
 women, first liking their faces, then tasting
their feasts, stepped from their 
Boards
 to their 
Beds,
 thence to their Altars,
adding spirituall to corporall fornication. This was done by the
 ad∣vice
of 
Balaam,
 whose counsell did more hurt then his curse. All his
charmes could have done them no harm, had he not raised these female
spirits to improve them, which cost the lives of twenty four thousand

Israelites,
 dying of the Plague; till the Javelin of
 
Phinehas
 executing of
judgment, stopped Gods fiery sword amongst them.


§ 20. Let us now request the Reader, to climbe up the hills of 
Aba∣rim,
Nebo,
 and 
Pisgah.
 These are a ledge of mountains rising by degrees
from east to west. So that some have compared 
Abarim
 to the Chancell,

Nebo
 to the Church, and 
Pisgah
 to the steeple. In mount 
Nebo
 the Authour
of the
 
Maccabees,
 speaks of a Cave, wherein 
Ieremy laid the Tabernacle,
and the Arke, and the Altar of Incense, and so stopped the door.
 But the same
Authour in the conclusion of his book confesseth, that his work is like

 
wine tempered with water:
 and we take this story to be no genuine juice
of the grape, and value it accordingly. On 
Pisgah, Moses
 surveyed the
whole land of 
Canaan,
 and although he was advantaged by the height of
the place, and clearness of his eyes (no whit abated in their sight at an

 hundred and twenty years of age) yet much of miracle must needs be ad∣mitted,
in so plain and far discovery. Here 
Moses
 was buried, being pri∣viledged
above other servants of God (whose souls Angels convey to
heaven) that an Angel was his Sexton, to cover his body in earth. Here
he concealed 
Moses
 his grave, lest the 
Israelites
 should goe a whoring af∣ter
it. Destroying Idolatry is a pious, but preventing it a more provi∣dent
Act, crushing it in the occasions thereof. Let none condemn this
for a needless caution, as if no fear that they who sometimes would


stone 
Moses
 while living, should adore him when dead. For the crooked
nature of the 
Iews
 was bowed to 
Extremes,
 and had no mean betwixt

hating,
 and 
adoring.
 Besides, when the memories of eminent men, hated
or envied when living, have passed the purgation of death, it is usuall
for their former enemies to fall in love with them.


§ 21. May the reader now conceive himself standing on the top of
mount 
Pisgah.
 Where (though content with a narrower compass, then
what 
Moses
 discerned) he descrieth a fair Prospect round about him.
Not to repeat the places of the west, because mentioned before, looking
south ward behold the City of 
Nebo,
 at the foot of its namesake moun∣tain:
and both of them so called from 
Nebo
 and 
Idoll God,
 hereabouts
worshipped. We read indeed how
 
Reuben
 changed the names of the
Cities of 
Nebo,
 and 
Baalmeon
 (because their old names taken from false
Gods resented of Idolatry.) But so hard it is to unhabit mens mouths
from old ill customes, that it seems their ancient names still prevailed
in common discourse.
 Criticks start many controversies concerning
this Idoll of 
Nebo;
 as: First, whether not originally
 a 
Babylonish
 Deity.
Secondly, whether under it the Moon (as the Sun under 
Bell
) was not
mystically adored. Thirdly, whether the same with 
Chemosh
 and 
Baal-Peor

(which is the opinion of Saint 
Ierome
) and if not, wherein lay the
difference? But it shall never trouble me, whether the fictitious Ser∣pents
of 
Iannes
 and 
Iambres
 the 
Egyptian
 enchanters, were made alike, or
did differ in some particulars, seeing the reall serpents of 
Moses
 devour∣ed
them all up. And seeing long since the service of the true God hath
confuted and confounded all worship of false Idols, I list not to trade in
the curiosities of distinctions betwixt them.


§ 22. Eastward behold 
Kiriathaim,
 or the 
two-towns
 (like 
Bridge-North

in 
Shropshire
) two lesser Cities being modelled into one. Here lived the

Emims,
 shrowdly smote by
 
Chederlaomer,
 which probably did facilitate
the 
Moabites
 in their victory over them. 
Iahaza,
 a City of the 
Levites,

where the 
Israelites
 in battell vanquished
 
Sibon King of the Amorites.
 A
little further see the City of 
Medeba,
 before the walls whereof a
 double
battell was fought and won at once, by 
Ioab
 against the 
Aramites,
 and

Abishai
 against the 
Ammonites.
 And it seems that the latter of these had at
this time the City in their possession, whither they retreated after their
overthrow. For what else doe those words import; 
The children of Am∣mon
likewise fled before Abishai his Brother,
 [and entred into the City,]
 except
any (conceiving it inconsistent with the present potency of 
David,
 to
have any of his enemies nestled in his dominion) will by 
the City
 under∣stand

Rabbah
 the Metropolis of 
Ammon,
 next year besieged and sacked by

Ioab.
 As for 
Medeba,
 there needs no other evidence to speak her ancient
greatness, then that 
Ptolemy
 by name takes notice thereof (though pla∣cing
it in 
Arabia
) which name it retained in the days of Saint 
Ierome.


§ 23. But northward is the most pleasant Prospect over the fair and


fruitfull 
Plains of Moab.
 Nor need any wonder why the 
Plain
 is so cal∣led,
seeing 
Moab
 had nothing on the north of 
Arnon
 (after the time of

Moses
) when they recollect, how lately all this land was possessed by
the 
Moabites,
 before 
Sihon
 forcibly expulsed them. Now to prove
that places sometimes are termed by their ancient Inhabitants, though
some hundred years after: we that live in 
London,
 need not goe no
further then the 
Old Iury;
 so called from the 
Iews
 once dwelling there,
now banished thence three hundred years agoe. But we keep the
Reader too long upon the top of this bleak and cold mountain. 'Tis
time to come down, when we have told him, that though 
Pisgah
 here
be taken for a proper name, yet it is often used as an appellative, for
any eminent ridge of a hill, which aspires above his fellowes. Know
also that all the Countrey hereabouts was called
 
Pisgah
 in the days of
Saint 
Ierome.


§ 24. Having now for a while reposed our selves in the pleasant
Plains of 
Moab,
 let us not tire when our task in this Tribe grows so
near to an end. Going a little northward we cannot misse the three
Stations whither 
Balak
 brought 
Balaam
 to curse the 
Israelites.
 For ha∣ving
first freely feasted 
Balaam
 at 
Kiriath-Huzzoth,
 his chief City in the
land of 
Moab,
 he brought him over 
Arnon,
 onely to see the utmost skirts
of the people, hoping if he could but kindle his curse in any cor∣ner,
it would quickly burn all 
the house of Israel.
 But thrice he struck fire
to no purpose.




1
t
. In 
Bamoth
 Baal
 or the high places of 
Baal.


2
ly
. In the field of
 
Zophim
 at the top of the hill.


3
ly
. In the top of 
Peor,
 which looks towards
 
Ieshimon:
 build∣ing
in each place seven Altars, and sacrificing a Bullock,
and Ram on every of them.




What was the designe of the Sorcerer? Conceived he that heaven
was covetous like himself, and might be bribed with sacrifices? Sure∣ly
the stench of his hypocrisie out-sented all the smell of his burnt offer∣ings.
Or thought he by often changing the scene to act the more upon
God? 
He that is the same yesterday and to day, and for ever,
 receives no
more impression from the shifting of place, then from the changing
of time. Or did he hope with the mystery of his numbers, 
Thrice seven
Altars;
 to flatter heaven into a consent? All numbers are but bare Cy∣phers
to him, that is infinite. O how he sweats for the wages of in∣iquity?
How is his tongue distracted between the Spirit of God and
the spirit of gold. All in vain; the further he goes, the worser he
speeds: but the better he speaks, falling at last from 
lenting, to down
right blessing of 
Israel.
 However, though he did not his work, he re∣ceived
his wages. And if 
Balak
 at that time did not pay him with gold;
yet afterwards the 
Israelites
 did with steel, justly slaying him with the

 sword.



§ 25. Pass we now, still more northward, by the place, where 
Elias

ascending to heaven in a 
Chariot of fire,
 left his 
mantle
 and 
a double portion
of his spirit
 to
 
Elisha
 his servant and successour: and by 
Mephaah
 a City
of the 
Levites,
 to 
Sibmah,
 so famous for her fruitfull vinyards. Going
through which, the Reader may 
eat grapes to the full at his own
 pleasure:
 A
liberty lawfully allowed him, but beware 
putting up any into his vessell,

lest he be apprehended for a trespasser. For the same law which pro∣vides
for his necessity, punisheth his covetousness. And what is this
whole world with the wealth thereof, but a vinyard, wherein happy
he, who hath enough to serve his turn, seeing 
when he dieth, he shall
 carry
nothing away with him.
 It seems in 
Sibmah
 there was some one signall vine
eminent for greatness above the rest, or else that all her vines grew so
close and uniform, that they resembled one entire and continued tree:
The
 Prophets always addressing themselves unto it in the singular
number, 
O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee,
 &c.


§ 26. Our work is ended, when we have viewed the north part of this
Tribe, where it confineth on 
Gad.
 Where we onely meet with one place
of note 
Heshbon,
 anciently the royall Palace of 
Sihon
 King of the 
Amorites,
 &
afterwards a City of the 
Levites.
 Which the Scripture placeth sometimes
in
 
Reuben,
 and sometimes in
 
Gad.
 To accommodate this difference
without making of two Cities of the same name (such multiplication
unwarrantable, save where absolute necessity enforceth it) I finde no fitter
expedient, then by setting 
Heshbon
 so equally between these two Tribes, as
partially in both, and totally in neither. Thus 
Bristoll
 is situated betwixt

Glocester
 and 
Somerset shires;
 and yet challengeth to be an absolute Liberty
of it self; as this 
Heshbon
 also was an entire demeans of the 
Levites.

One fair gate it had, called 
Beth Rabbim gate,
 nigh to which were
most clear and pleasant fishponds, to which the
 eyes of the 
Spouse
 are
compared by 
Solomon.
 Not that she was troubled with watery eyes
like 
Leah,
 (the resemblance being recounted amongst her perfections,
not defects) or that her eyes (as some may fancy) are compared to
Pools, moistened with teares for her sins, but because of her clear
and perspicuous vision and apprehension of heavenly Myste∣ries.


§ 27. As for the mountains of 
Emek,
 which M
r
. 
More
 in his Map,
without alledging any warrant from Scripture, (otherwise his con∣stant
custome) makes the bounds betwixt 
Reuben
 and 
Gad;
 I have
placed them accordingly, yet so that the Reader (without a miraculous
Faith) may remove these mountains to some other place, when he
finds just cause for the same. At which time also, when proceeding
on more infallible principles for their situation, let him take down
our conjecturall Flags from the tops of 
Mephaah,
 
Zerethshahar,
 &c.
now placed but by guesse, and let him dispose of them, if he can, in a
more exact position.



§ 28. So much for 
Reuben,
 not forgetting how in the days of 
Solomon

when the land was divided into 
twelve Purveyer
-ships to make monthly
provisions for his Courts
 
Gebar the son of Uri
 had al the country once 
of Si
∣on
King of the Amorites
 (but then possest by 
Reuben
) in his circuit whence no
doubt plenty of good fare out of this Pasture-countrey so abounding in
cattell, was brought to 
Ierusalem.
 Now we have placed the name of

Amorites
 on the sinister front of this our description, because they were
the old inhabitants of this Countrey: our constant custome through this
Book in the adverse page opposite to the 
Tribes
 name to insert one of
the seven Nations of 
Canaan,
 (former owners of that land) conceiving
it to conduce much to the illustration of Scripture.


§ 29. Modern Heralds, by Commission authorized from the
Jewish 
Rabbines,
 assign to 
Reuben
 for armes, 
Argent, three Bars waveè
azure,
 in allusion to 
Iacobs
 Legacy,
 
Unstable as water, thou shalt not excell.

For as water cannot hold it self, but as it is held in a vessell, so 
Reuben

could not contain himself within the bounds of chastity, till shame and
sorrow did reclaim him. Besides, as water once shed, is never to be
gathered up again; so 
Reuben
 could never after recollect his lost credit,
to recover the full favour of his Father. Though once he endevoured
to gather up some spilt drops of his reputation by projecting the de∣liverance
of
 
Ioseph
 from his brethren: but his design miscarried.


§ 30. For mine own part, I cannot concur with the common opi∣nion,
that these three 
Bars waveè
 were the Armes of 
Reuben;
 princi∣pally
because Armes are honorary ensignes, assign'd, or assum'd for
the greater grace of the bearer▪ Improbable therefore, that this Tribe to per∣petuate
the infamy of their ancestour would always have water running
in their shield, as if 
Reubens
 crime were the 
Reubenites
 credit; like such
whom the
 Apostle reproves, 
that glory in their shame.
 Rather let us
hearken to 
Aben Ezra,
 who allots to the banner of 
Reuben
 a man or
male child (others a mandrake, others put mandrakes in his hand) re∣lating
to 
Leahs
 words at his birth, calling him 
Reuben,
 that is,
 
See a Son,

causing her 
to forget her pain, for joy that a man child was borne into the world.


§ 31. The proper place for the standard of this Tribe was to be the
 first
of the three Tribes which pitched on the south of the Tabernacle. Thus
though 
Reuben
 lost the Primacy of power over all, he still kept the pre∣cedency
of place before one quarter of his brethren. Whence parents
may be taught, that though on just ground they disinherit, yet not so
wholly to dishearten their eldest sons, but still suffer some re∣membrances
of a birthright ever to remain unto them.




FINIS.








Here the Map of 
Gad
 is to be inserted.
















The third Book. THE TRIBE OF GAD.


§ 1. 
G
Ad
 eldest Son of

Iacob
 by 
Zilpah,
 so increased in

Egypt,
 that
 forty five thousand six hundred and
fifty males of twenty years old and upward of
this Tribe were numbred at Mount 
Sinai:
 all
which falling in the wilderness for their tem∣pting
of God with this disobedience, a new gene∣ration
of forty thousand
 and five hundred entred the 
Land of Canaan.

This Tribe affordeth very martiall men. For such of them as repaired
to 
David
 in 
Ziglag
 are described,
 
Men of war, fit for the battell, that could
handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like to the faces of Lyons, and were as
swift as the Roes upon the mountaines.
 Yet I meet not with any publick Ma∣gistrate
extracted from 
Gad,
 though the
 Genealogists rank 
Iehu
 with
four of his Posterity successive Kings of 
Israel
 amongst the 
Gadites;
 but
on no other ground, then because at the first time he is found mentioned
in Scripture he was
 imployed a Commander at the siege of 
Ramoth
Gilead
 a City
 in this Tribe. It seems that as the English-law makes a
charitable provision for children left by their parents, that the Parish
wherein they are first taken up, must maintain them: so Genealogists,
the better to methodize the pedegrees of the 
Iews
 in Scripture, reduce
Persons of unknown Parentage, to those respective Tribes, in whose
grounds they first light on the mention of them. But let 
Iehu
 pass for a

Gadite:
 the rather because so puisant a Prince, will prove a credit, rather
then a charge to that Tribe to which he is related.


§ 2. The land of this Tribe was of a double nature. For what lay
north of the river 
Iabbok
 was anciently the possession of 
Og King of Basan.

But what lay south of the river, had its property more intricate and in∣cumbred
with often exchange of her owners, and on the right under∣standing
thereof depends no less, then the asserting of the innocence of
the 
Israelites,
 the confuting of the cavill of the 
Ammonites,
 and the re∣conciling
of a seeming contradiction in Scripture; Take it thus briefly.






1
t
. It was the Land of certain Giants called
 
Zamzummims.


2
ly
. It was possessed by the
 
Ammonites,
 who destroied those Giants,
and this Countrey was accounted a moity or one half of their
dominion.


3
ly
. It was subdued by
 
Sihon King of the Amorites,
 who cast out the

Ammonites
 (when also he destroied the 
Moabites
) such as were
south of 
Iabbok,
 and dwelt in their stead.


Lastly, after the overthrow of 
Sihon, Moses
 gave it to the Tribe of

Gad,
 for their inheritance. Thus God by ringing the Changes
of successive Lords in this Land made musick to his own glory.




Behold we here what the Psalmist
 saith, 
Thou hast brought a Vine out of
Egypt, thou preparest room before it;
 the method and manner of which pre∣paration
is most remarkable. First, God in his providence foresaw
that the Countrey of the 
Canaanites
 was without other addition too nar∣row,
to receive the numerous people of 
Israel.
 Secondly, God in his
goodness resolved out of love to righteous 
Lot,
 that his posterity should
not totally lose their possession, nor would he suffer the 
Israelites
 their
kinsmen to deprive them of any parcell thereof; giving them a flat
command to the contrary.
 Lastly, God in his justice permitted 
Sihon
King of the Amorites
 should win part of the Countrey from 
Moab
 and

Ammon;
 and suddenly sends the 
Israelites
 to conquer the conquerour;
and now lawfully to inherit, what the other had wrongfully taken a∣way:
And thus 
he prepared room for his Vine.


§ 3. By this time we plainly perceive, that in the 
Ammonites
 demand
to 
Iephtha,
 there was some truth blinded with more falshood, that the
countenance of the former might pass the latter unsuspected.
 
Israel took
away
 (saith the King) 
my Land when they came out of Egypt from Arnon even
unto Iabbok, and unto Iordan; now therefore restore these Lands again peaceably.

True it was, that this Land was once theirs (and so it is plainly called

Ioshua
 13. 25.) but most false, that ever the 
Israelites
 took Inch of ground
from them, save onely mediately and at the second hand, taking it
from 
Sihon,
 who took it from the 
Ammonites.
 We report the rest to 
Ieph∣tha's

answer (who first with a fair ambassie, and then with a famous
victory confuted the 
Ammonites
 antiquated title to this territory) plea∣ding
that the 
Israelites
 had three
 hundred years peaceably possessed the
same. Now, if upon a strict account, some years fall short of that sum,
the matter is not much, because souldiers love to fill their mouths with
a round number, and too hundred fifty and odde with a good sword
may well be counted three hundred years currant, though not com∣pleate.


§ 4. The Tribe of 
Gad
 had the kingdome of 
Ammon
 on the east, the
half Tribe of 
Manasseh
 on the north, 
Reuben
 on the south, and the river

Iordan
 on the west. The length thereof from 
Aroer
 to 
Iordan
 may be
computed thirty five miles: and the breadth thereof from 
Mahanaim
 to



Dibon,
 falls out a little less. A Tribe inferiour to none for fair rivers, fruit∣full
Pastures, shady woods: superiour to most for populous Cities, and
memorable actions atchieved therein. As for 
Balme
 or 
Balsame,
 it was
a peculiar commodity of this Countrey. Thus the Prophet betwixt
grief, anger, and pity demands, 
Is
 there no balme in Gilead?
 and again, 
Goe
up into Gilead, and take
 balm O virgin.
 In describing this Countrey we
will follow the streams of 
Arnon, Iabbok,
 and 
Iordan,
 which (with some
little help lent us besides) will afford us the conveniency to behold all
remarkable mounts in this Countrey.


§ 5. In the eastern part of this Tribe the rivers of 
Arnon
 and 
Iabbok

(though running contrary ways) arise not far asunder: according to
the exact observation of
 
Iosephus,
 who saith that the land of 
Sihon King
of the Amorites, lay in nature and fashion like an Island,
 betwixt the three rivers
of 
Iordan, Arnon,
 and 
Iabbok,
 so near are the fountains of the latter to∣gether.
The heads of their springs are found in a mountainous and rocky
soil, affording great plenty of 
Iackalls;
 mungrell creatures of equivo∣call
extraction, deriving cruelty from the Wolves their sires and craft
from the Foxes their dams. These 
Iackalls
 are meant by our translatours

Psalm 63. 10. Let them fall by the edge of the sword, that they may be a portion
for Foxes:
 not for ordinary Foxes, which indeed are so dainty mouthed,
that they will not feed on any carkasse, but what they kill themselves:
but for these 
Iackalls
 (which may pass for Foxes, because so by the surer
side) so ravenous, that they will not onely feed on carion above ground,
but even dig holes into the earth, fetch forth, and feed on dead bodies of
men, if not deeply interred.


§ 6. The river 
Arnon
 running full south passeth by
 
Aroer,
 a fair City
whereof frequent mention in Scripture, but in no other notion, but
onely as the eastern boundary of 
Canaan.
 Here 
Arnon
 entertaineth a
river from the west, called the river of
 
Gad,
 because rising, running, and
falling within the compass of this Tribe.


§ 7. This river of 
Gad
 had formerly received into it another stream
called the waters of 
Nimrim,
 threatned by the
 Prophets to be dried up: on
the banks whereof 
Bethnimrah
 a City was seated. At the conflux of these
two, the 
Sea of Iazer
 is found, being no other then a Lake (about our 
Whit∣tlesey
Meer in Hungtingtonshire,
 for greatness) as the 
Iews
 call the meetings
of all waters, whether fresh, or salt, 
Seas.
 Nor let their language herein
be challenged for impropriety, having a warrant from God himself,

who at the creation, 
called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the
waters called he Seas.
 Conformable hereunto is the expression of the
modern Dutch; for in 
Helvetia
 a Province of 
Germany,
 yea in 
Argow
 (as I
may say) a County of


Helvetia,
 I have told above sixteen Seas, 
Zuger∣see,
Thuner-see, Ober-see, Rot-see,
 &c. though the biggest of them but
lakes in effect. Yea the 
Iews
 did so far extend, or rather, so straitly contract
the word 
Sea,
 that, that capable vessell of brass, used as a Lavatory for


the sacrifices in the Temple, was tearmed the
 
Molten Sea. Iazer,
 which
gave name to this Sea, was a
 City of the 
Levites
 hard by, whereat some
sad accident had happened, though the particulars thereof are not dis∣covered
in Scripture, for 
the
 weeping of Iazer
 passeth in the Prophet as
the expression of great lamentation.


§ 8. Hence the 
river of Gad
 passeth by 
Civitas interammis,
 or the 
City in
the midst of the river,
 wherewith on all sides it is environed, never mentio∣ned
in Scripture but with the company of
 
Aroer:
 a clear evidence both
of their distinction and vicinity. Hereabouts 
Ioab
 pitched his tent,
when sent to number the people. Wonder not that having the conve∣nience
of three Cities so near to receive him, he preferred rather to re∣side
in a tent during that imployment. For (besides that such movable
habitations comply best with military men) it was fittest for the work
in hand; where the people to be reckoned might have full and free ac∣cesse
in open aire; both wholsomer for the persons, and speedyer in dis∣patch,
then when pent within the streets and walls of a City. Nothing
else memorable remains in the southeast corner of this Tribe, save 
Dibon,

a City sometimes assigned to
 
Reuben,
 and sometimes to
 
Gad.
 To
reconcile this, some make them different and distant Cities; which in
my apprehension is rather to set up two marks then to hit the right one.
For seeing these two Tribes confine together, and both lay claim to

Dibon
 (like the two mothers challenging the living childe) we have
onely, in stead of a sword, made use of pricks, setting it equally in the
bounds of both. Here we advise the Reader (not out of distrust of his
skill, but desire of his good) to beware, neither to confound this 
Dibon
in Gad,
 with
 
Dibon-Gad,
 the thirty ninth station of the 
Israelites
 as they
came out of 
Egypt;
 nor with another
 
Dibon,
 which seems to be in 
Iudah,

wherein the 
Iews
 dwelt after their captivity.


§ 9. The river of 
Iabbok
 arising out of the aforesaid stony countrey,
first runs directly northward, and strengthened with an acce
ion of
waters from the 
Kingdome of Ammon,
 turns his stream full west. In which
course ere long he cometh to the ford which 
Iacob
 with his family pas∣sed
over: and where we crave the Readers leave for a while to discon∣tinue
our discourse of this river, and to attend that worthy Patriarch in
his travels through this Tribe, which in form of a Belt crossed 
Gad

athwart from northeast to southwest. 
Iacob
 first entring into this Tribe
came to 
Nahanaim,
 that is, 
the two campes,
 because there the
 Angels di∣gested
into two armies (probably behind and before him) appeared
to 
Iacob.
 Now as
 
Adams
 naming the Creatures argued his dominion
over them; so the 
Patriarchs
 naming of places in 
Canaan,
 was an Earnest
that their posterity should possesse them. Who no doubt, as curious to
enquire, so were carefull to continue those names which their Ancestors
had given them. 
Mahanaim
 was afterwards a
 City of the 
Levites,
 and in
the reign of
 
Ishbosheth
 the son of 
Saul,
 it was made the chief City of his


kingdome. But with his
 life within three years expired the 
Metropolis∣ship

of 
Mahanaim,
 which afterwards afforded refuge and residence to

 
David,
 when flying from 
Ierusalem
 for fear of 
Absolom.
 Hither the news
of 
Absoloms
 death was brought to King 
David
 (joyfull to the King, but
dolefull to 
David
) which caused his patheticall
 lamentation over the
gate, till the heat of
 
Ioabs
 anger dryed up 
Davids
 teares; perswading
him with cheerfull looks to countenance the conquerours.


§ 10. From 
Mahanaim,
 let us goe fairly, and softly on with an easie
pace in the company of 
Iacob
 (not overdriving his children and cattell
to the above named
 fords of 
Iabbok
) and thence to 
Peni
l,
 where 
Iacob

(the youngest warriour
 fighting before he was born, and the strongest
Conquerour) prevailed with God appearing like an Angell. Who in
admonition to 
Iacob,
 that he overcame not with his own striving, but
his opposites yeelding, gave him a gentle touch, being pleased, where he
could have broken the bone, onely to shrink the sinew, whereupon

Iacob
 carried an upright heart, and lame leg to his grave. Indeed
learned
 
Rivet
 is of opinion, that God presently healed his halting,
chiefly grounding it, because 
Esau
 at his meeting took no notice of his
lameness: but doth not the negative follow with more probability, be∣cause
the Scripture takes no notice of his curing? Besides, had the cure
come so quick, the hurt had never left so deep and long lasting impressi∣on
in the practise of the 
Israelites,
 abstaining, for that cause, from eating
the
 sinew in the thigh. Yea modern 
Iews
 (oh that they were as obser∣vant
of the substantiall as ceremoniall parts of the old Testament!) not
certain which sinew it was (so many meeting in the thigh) refrain from
feeding on
 all Nerves in the hinder parts of a beast.


§ 11. From 
Peniel
 going southwest 
Iacob
 being to meet 
Esau
 his bro∣ther,
thus marshalled his company. In the forefront his Concubines with
their children, next 
Leah
 with hers, 
Rachel
 and 
Ioseph,
 first in his love and
last in place, because furthest from danger; before all, like a valiant
Commander taking the worst service on himself, marched 
Iacob
 in per∣son,
having sent before him his presents to 
Esau,
 and dispatched before
them his prayers to God. See what gifts & good words, a fair tongue and
full hand can doe. 
Esau
 in stead of killing falls a
 kissing him. Behold
how they hug! being now more twins, then in their mothers womb:
for there they strove, but here they embraced. From 
Peniel Iacob
 travelled
to
 
Succoth,
 in English 
Boothes,
 because there he erected tents for himself
and his cattell: and so he went over 
Iordan,
 into the Tribe of 
Ephraim

to the City of 
Sichem;
 whither (God willing) hereafter we will fol∣low
him. And now seeing the way which we have come is both plain
and pleasant, let me request the Reader not to begrutch his pains to goe
some part of it back again, onely exchanging the company of plain
dealing 
Iacob,
 for valiant 
Gideon:
 who in his march traversed this Tribe
from the west to the east thereof.



§ 12. 
Gideon
 pursuing the flying 
Midianites
 with his souldiers, as faint
as few for want of victualls, coming to 
Succoth,
 desired food from the
inhabitants thereof. The 
Succothites
 were so far from granting him pro∣vision,
they would not give him good words, not more niggardly of
their victualls then prodigall of their
 taunts unto him. Wherefore 
Gide∣on

in his return (not then at leasure, that his wrath should hinder his
work) with briars and thorns of the wood hard by, tare their flesh in
pieces. The originall saith, 
he taught them with thorns,
 or 
made them to know,

namely their own folly and his power. Dull Scholars must have sharp

eachers: or rather 
like unto like,
 churlish crabbed dispositions, and
prickly crooked thorns well agree together. Hence 
Gideon
 marched to

Peniel,
 whose Citizens (neighbours to 
Succoth
 both in place and peevish∣ness)
churlishly entertained him; which cost them at his return the
breaking down of their
 tower, which was afterwards
 reedified by
King 
Ieroboam.
 From 
Peniel Gideon
 went forward, 
by the way of them
that dwelt in
 tents,
 on the east of 
Nobah
 and 
Iogbehah
 against the 
Midia∣nites,

unto 
Karkor,
 which being out of the Tribe of 
Gad,
 we shall hear
more of it in our description of 
Midian.


§ 13. The mention of 
those that dwell in tents,
 puts me in mind, that it
is as much my duty here to tender my conjecture to the Reader, as it is
his liberty to receive or reject it. There was a Countrey, undoubtedly in
this Tribe, called the
 
Land of Tahtim-hodshi,
 that is, 
newly inhabited,
 where

Ioab
 made his second station, when sent to number the people. Now
may not this in probability be the very place, where the 
Israelites
 former∣ly
dwelled in tents, and in 
Davids
 victorious reign were reduced to more
stability, and incouraged to turn their tents into houses, more certain
and solid habitations?


§ 14. To return now to the river 
Iabbok,
 half impatient for our long
deserting it, save that running westward, it glides cooly and calmly un∣der
the shade of 
the forest of Ephraim,
 so called, as learned men con∣jecture,
(for otherwise 
Ephraim
 possessed not any thing on this side 
Ior∣dan
)
because there
 
Iephtha
 defeated the 
Ephraimites
 for their insolent mu∣tiny
against him. But afterwards a greater slaughter happened in the
same place, when 
Ioab, Abishai,
 and 
Ittai
 Generalls for 
David,
 routed 
Ab∣saloms
 army, and
 when the wood devoured more then the sword. Wonder
not that sticks had a mouth more voracious then steel, understand it that
some were devoured by beasts, others famished as lost in the labyrinths
of the forest, and some staked on sharp piles in the fierceness of their
flight. Well might such sad fate befall the common souldiers, which
happened to 
Absalom
 himself. This was he that boasted how upright he
would be when made a
 Judge, whereas now, if the length of his hair
conduced any thing to his execution, it was the best, yea onely piece of
justice performed by him. Yet more probable it is, that running in hast
(not so minding which way to goe, as to be gone) he was snatched up


by the neck in a forked
 bough: How did the officious Oake act three
parts, being the Gallows, Halter, and Hangman for a traitour?
But this accident rather occasioned then caused his death: the Oake
was rather his Gaolor then his Executioner. It was 
Ioab
 that dispatched
him with three darts through his
 
heart.
 Wherein through a treble
orifice were discovered Disobedience to his Parent, Treason to his
Prince, and Hypocrisie to his God, pretending a
 Sacrifice and inten∣ding
Rebellion.


§ 15. Hard by was 
Absoloms
 Tombe, consisting of a great
 pit to
hold, and a 
great heap of stones to hide
 a great Traitour under it. May they
there lie hard and heavy on his Corpes, and withall (if possible) sink
down his rebellious example for ever having a resurrection. No me∣thodicall
monument but this hurdle of stones was fittest for such a
causer of confusion. Indeed in his life time he had erected a stately

Pillar near 
Ierusalem,
 intending it no doubt for the place of his buriall.
But just it was that his dead carkass should be deprived of his own
grave, who endevoured to dispossess his living Father of his king∣dome.


§ 16. And now a little to acquaint the Reader with the adjacent
Countrey, two severall ways led hence to the City of 
Mahanaim.
 The
one through the mountains, shorter but harder, which 
Cushi
 chose: The
other
 
by the way of the plain,
 which the furthest about was the nearest
way home. 
Ahimaaz
 took this as the most ready Road, who being a
messenger 
volunteer,
 would confess to 
David
 no more news then what
he knew would be welcome, whilest 
Cushi
 a prest Post must relate the
full of his message. And now the river 
Iabbok,
 who hitherto may seem
to run slowly, as attending in suspence the issue of the Battell, cer∣tified
of the success thereof hastens with all possible speed to fall into the
river 
Iordan.


§ 17. 
Iordan
 had now some distance of miles escaped out of the sea
of 
Kinneroth
 or 
Sea of Galilee:
 the 
edge whereof Iosh.
 13. 26. is assigned for
the utmost border of this Tribe. Through this lake (as 
Tacitus
 observeth)
this river kept his ready course, preserving his stream intire from incor∣porating
with the waters of the Lake. A thing no whit incredible to
those 
Welshmen
 in 
Merioneth-shire,
 who have beheld how the river 
Dee
 run∣ning
through
 
Pimble-meer
 continueth his channell without mixing with
the 
Meer.
 On the east side of this Sea stood the City of 
Gadara;
 (the first
syllable whereof is argument enough to place it in this Tribe) where the

Legion of Devills
 cast out of the man entred into the 
herd of Swine:
 where
a threefold difficulty appeareth in the relation of the story.




1 Whilest other
 Gospells mention but one, Saint
 
Matthew
 makes
two men possest with a Devill.


2 The same tearmeth them 
Gergasens
 whom other Gospells name

Gadarens.



3 Seeing Swine till killed, return their owners no profit, and then
their flesh was forbidden to the 
Iews
 to eate, how came the 
Ga∣darens,

being undoubtedly 
Iews
 (otherwise Christ would not
have conversed with them) to keep such a company of useless
cattell?




But these difficulties accept of their severall solutions.




1 Though two were possest, one of them being Paramount in tor∣ture
and unruliness eclipsed the mention of the other, the second
not being named in the presence of the principall.


2 
Gadara
 and 
Gerazen,
 though distinct, were neighbouring Cities,
and so might have joint commonage of cattell betwixt them.


3 They kept Swine to truck and barter with other nations.
Though their flesh was unclean in the mouths, yet their money
was clean in the purses of the 
Iews.
 But if any conceive they
kept Swine not onely 
ad usum
 but 
ad esum,
 such must acknow∣ledge
the drowning of them to be the owners just punishment
for their breaking Gods commandements.




But when those Hogs were sunk in the sea, a greater herd of them
remained in the City: swinish people, who preferred to wallow on
the dunghill of their own wealth, rather then to possess the pearl of
Christs presence, whom they requested to depart out of their coasts. So
much of the 
Gadarens,
 and their neighbours the 
Gergasens,
 onely let me
adde, that from the affinity of sound some have collected, the 
Girgashites

anciently to have inhabited this countrey, (as we have formerly obser∣ved)
and therefore in the title of every leafe we have divided this Tribe
betwixt them and the 
Amorites,
 as the old possessors thereof.


§ 18. 
Strabo
 reports how there is a little Lake near to the City of 
Ga∣dara

infected with such malignant and pestiferous qualities, that it scald∣eth
off the skin of whatsoever is cast into it. This may seem an effect of
the Devills in the hogs, 
(Satan
 when he departs useth to leave such per∣fumes
behind him) and semblably the possessed man stripped himself
of all his clothes and went naked. But seeing the Scriptures say expresly
that the hogs ran into the Sea, and not into this petty 
Lake,
 I dare not
assign this as the cause of those mischievous waters.


§ 19. 
Iordan
 having got out of the aforesaid 
Sea of Galilee
 is presently
crossed over with a stately Bridge. I conceive it of no great antiquity
(no stone thereof appearing in the Scripture) but 
Mercators Maps
 take
notice thereof. And a moderate 
Iesuite
 tells us (observe it Reader
against the time thou travellest into those parts) that the way over this
bridge, though somewhat further about and less frequented, is an easier
and safer rode from 
Damascus
 to 
Ierusalem,
 then what is commonly gone
over 
Iacobs bridge
 in the Tribe of 
Naphtali,
 whereof God willing here∣after.


§ 20. And now 
Iordan
 being enriched with the tributary waters


of 
Iabbok
 g
ows fair and large, yet not so deep but that it is fordable, espe∣cially
at that place so fatall to the
 
Ephraimites,
 where fourty two thou∣sand
of them were by 
Iephthah
 put to the sword. Four-sold was the of∣fence
of these 
Ephraimites.




1 They neglected on seasonable
 summons to assist 
Iephthah
 a∣gainst
the 
Ammonites.


2 They falsly retorted the fault on 
Iephthah,
 and being wilfully
deaf at his call accused him for dumbe not calling them.


3 They gave the 
Gileadites
 reproachfull language, calling them

 
Runnagates.


4 They menaced to burn 
Iephthah
 and his house with fire.




Hereupon 
Iephthah
 defended himself, and defeated them in a memo∣rable
overthrow. The 
Ephraimites
 being routed fled to these fords of 
Ior∣dan,

so hoping to recover their own countrey on the other side. But all
in vain. 
Iordan
 indeed might here be waded over; but no passage over
the swelling Surges of their enemies anger▪ How willingly would those
who called others 
Runnagates
 have been now 
Runnaways
 themselves; but
could not be permitted? The 
Gileadites
 pursued, yea prevented them,
and arraigned them all for their lives. 
Shiboleth
 is their 
neck-word
 (and as
ratling in the throat is generally to sick men) so lisping of their tongues
was a certain Symptome of their death.


§ 21. Some will accuse 
Iep
thah
 of cruelty, that not contented with the honour of the Conquest he followed the Chace so furiously, as to
suffer his sword not onely to drink to mirth, but to swill to drunkenness
in the bloud of his brethren. But haply this execution without order
from him might be done by the 
Gileadites
 in heat of anger: Souldiers
in the Precipice of their passion being sensible of no other stop but the
bottome. If done by 
Iepthah's
 command, surely his own security
enforced this severity, as a dolefull, but needfull, a sad, but safe way to
prevent the growth of another war, the seeds whereof 
Iephthah
 foresaw
in the revengefull disposition of the 
Ephraimites.
 However some actions in
the old Testament as they may not be imitated, so they must not be con∣demned,
whose Actors might have immediate commission of divine
inspiration.


§ 22. From hence 
Iordan
 casteth a glancing eye at the fair City of

Iabesh-Gilead,
 sweetly seated at the bottome of Balm-bearing mountains.
The Inhabitants hereof ingaged not with the rest of 
Israel
 against the

Benjamites,
 for which offence they were all slain save four hundred
young
 Virgins, which were given to the 
Benjamites
 to wife. Thus the

Benjamites
 being 
Gileadites
 by the mother side, it was not onely pro∣tection
to his subjects, but also love to his kindred which invited 
Saul
 to
succour this City, when 
Naash
 the 
Ammonite
 besieged it. Painfull and
shamefull were the conditions of Peace which 
Naash
 offered them,
namely
 
if he might thrust out their right eyes,
 which was to render their


Souldiers stark blind in effect. For whereas the 
Iews
 were wont to wear
in war broad shields on their left arme, which as it sheltered their body,
so it hindred their sight on that side) when their right eye was put out
by their enemies sword, and the left blinded by their own shield, they
were, during the fight, deprived of the best fence of their body. But

 
Saul
 saved all this harm by a speedy march, suddenly surprizing the

Ammonites,
 and delivering the City of 
Iabesh-Gilead.


§ 23. Gratitude to 
Saul
 for so great a benefit probably did afterwards
put the people of this City on that honourable, but dangerous designe
to rescue 
Saul
 and his sons bodies from the wall of 
Bethshan,
 where the

 
Philistines
 had hanged them up. It was no pleasant prospect to these
men of 
Iabesh, Bethshan
 being opposite on the other side of 
Iordan
 over
against them, some eight miles off. (Loialty hath a quick sight and a
tender heart, at a distance to behold and bemoan affronts to her Sove∣raign)
Did 
Saul
 preserve their right eyes to this end, contentedly to be∣hold
his body abused? Out march all the valiant men in the City in the
night over 
Iordan: Sauls
 and his sons corps they took down from 
Bethshan,

bring them home, burn the flesh, and bury the bones thereof under a
 tree
neare the City. The 
Iews
 generally interring their dead under some Oak,
pleased perchance with the parallel, that as those plants seemingly dead
in winter, have every spring an annuall resurrection: so mens dry
bones shall have new sap put into them at the day of Judgment.
 
Da∣vid

afterwards removed the bones of 
Saul
 and 
Ionathan,
 & buried them in
the sepulchre of 
Kish
 their father in 
Zelab
 in the Countrey of
 
Benjamin.


§ 24. From the 
fords of Ephraim, Iordan
 taketh his course by the Cities
of
 
Ataroth
 and
 
Debir,
 of which we can say neither more nor less, but
that they are called 
Ataroth
 and 
Debir.
 For these places
(let
 
Ataroth-sho∣phan,

 Beth-haran &c.
 march in the same rank) are so short-lived in Scri∣pture,
that they live onely to be named, and presently vanish away, with∣out
any more mention of them. Not long after 
Iordan
 leaving this Tribe
runneth into 
Reuben.


§ 25. More inland in 
Gad
 lay the large and fruitfull Countrey of

Gilead,
 whereof more fitly and fully in the next Tribe. For though this
Tribe of 
Gad
 had 
South-Gilead
 in her borders; yet under favour I con∣ceive
that 
North-Gilead
 (which belonged to 
Manasseh
) was the firstand
best Countrey of that name. Now whereas we read in
 Scripture, that

Gad had all the Cities of Gilead,
 and few verses after, that 
Manasseh had half

 Gilead;
 know that 
Gilead
 is taken restrictively in the former, and gene∣rally
in the latter acception.


§ 26. 
Ramoth-Gilead
 (called also
 
Ramo
h-mizpeh
) was metropolis of

Gad-Gilead.
 It belonged to the 
Levites,
 and was also a City of
 refuge, af∣terwards
won by the King of
 
Aram.
 Then, (alas) that city, which so
often had saved others from the pursuit of their enemies, could not pre∣serve
it self from the sword of the 
Syrians.
 Here it was verified, 
Quod non


capit Christus,
 rapit fiscus.
 For upon 
Ieroboams
 introducing of Idolatry, the
pious 
Levites
 were outed of their possessions, and now the pagan 
Syrians,

revenging their quarrell, ejected 
Israel
 out of this City, wrongfully
wrested from the 
Levites.


§ 27. However not long after 
Ahab
 and 
Iehoshaphat
 with joint forces
besieged it, when the army of the 
Syrians
 bad them both battell. 
Iehosha∣phat

at 
Ahabs
 perswasion (pretending his honour, but intending therein
his own safety) appeared in his Princely equipage, whilest the other dis∣guised
himself in the army. Now the 
Syrians
 having received speciall or∣ders,

 
to fight neither against small nor great, save onely with the King of Israel,

mistake 
Iehoshaphat
 for the 
King of Israel,
 directed in their conjectures un∣to
him by the lustre of his royall Robes. Bravery betrays men to danger,
and not onely sets up a fair mark, but giveth malice the right ground to
throw at it. And was it not just with 
God,
 that 
Iehoshaphat,
 who in com∣plement
had profest to 
Ahab, I am
 as thou art,
 should in realty be taken
to be the same indeed? But upon his crying out the 
Syrians
 apprehend
their errour, and desist from further pursuing him.


§ 28. But divine Justice continues the chace of 
Ahab.
 Guilt cannot
hide it self in a croud, and there is no way for a notorious sinner, to dis∣guise
himself from Gods eye, but by his sincere repentance. A man
draws a 
bow at
 adventures,
 and all-seeing providence guiding blind chance
to the joints of 
Ahabs
 armour, mortally wounds him. It seems not one∣ly
the Corselet, but also the putting on thereof must be 
of proof
 to fence
death out, which otherwise will creep in at a small cranny. Yet 
Ahab
 was
staid up in his chariot til even, & then the Sun & his life set together. Some
years after King 
Iehoram Ahabs son
 at the same place received
 wounds of
more honour and less danger, when forcibly he recovered this 
Ramoth-Gilead

from the Kings of 
Syria.
 But of all 
Iehorams
 hurts here received,
none went so near his heart, as that in this
 City, 
a son of the Prophets
 sent by

Elisha,
 did anoint 
Iehu,
 a Captain of the Hoste, to be his successour and
King of 
Israel.


§ 29. We had wholly forgotten (no shame to confess and amend our
faults) the small Countrey of 
Sharon
 in the north-east part
 of this tribe.
It seems it was parcell of the demeans of the Crown in the days of King

David,
 where his heards
 were fed under the care and charge of 
Shetrai

the 
Sharonite. David
 we see was not onely a good man, and good King,
but also a good husband, stocking this his land to his best profit, know∣ing
full well, soon would the State of his Court-hall be abated, if the
thrift in his countrey Kitchin were not preserved. Nor was 
Sharon
 a
place less pleasant then profitable, where plenty of fragrant roses grew,
to which Christ (the Churches spouse) is pleased to
 resemble himself;
not for any fading condition, but fair sight, sweet smell, and cordiall
vertues wherein he excelled.


§ 30. Here some will inquire, In what capacity did 
David
 hold his


land in 
Sharon
 (and elsewhere) where his cattell was grased,
 seeing
being 
Iesse's
 youngest Son, little land was left him from his Father, and
none at all in the 
Tribe of Gad.
 The difficulty is increased, because in so
pent and populous a countrey, scarce a foot thereof, but related to some
owner not having power to alienate it from his heires, to whom at the
farthest it was to revert at the 
year of Iubilee
 when all dead possessions had
a resurrection to their proper owners. We conceive 
David
 held this land
by one of the following Titles.




1 
By the fundamentall establishment of the Crown.
 For sure when that
Kings were made, publick provision was made for their Prince∣ly
support, who (as Lords of Manors have commonage 
sance
number
 amongst their Tenants) might feed their cattell any where
in their own dominions.


2 
By improvement of wast grounds,
 which fell to the King as 
Lord of the
Soile.
 Yea seeing God made provisionary Laws for the Kings
behaviour, (
 four hundred years before any King was in 
Israel
)
why might not a 
reserve of land
 be also left, at the partition of the
countrey by lot, for their Kings future maintenance?


3 
By mutuall compact:
 some subjects on valuable consideration, (as
perchance the relaxing the tribute due from every person to his
Prince)
 might part (not with the propriety, but) present pro∣fit
of their land for the Kings conveniency.


4 
By attainder of Traitours:
 whose lands it seems were (at least for
some term of time) at the Kings disposall; witness 
Davids
 grant∣ing
all
 
Mephibosheth
 had unto 
Ziba.


5 
By conquest,
 as most probable it is this 
Sharon
 was won from the

Ammonites,
 when
 
Rabba
 was taken from them.




However we may prefume that 
Davids
 title (though unknown to us)
was undoubted in it self, free from the least suspicion of injustice, accor∣ding
to his own counsell:
 
Trust not in oppression, become not vain in robbery.

Otherwise his tender conscience would as wel have smote him for 
cutting
off a lap
 of his subjects ground, as of his
 Soveraigns garment.


§ 31. We have finished the description of this Tribe and all places
therein mentioned in Cononicall Scripture, onely there remains behind
some Cities which we finde in the 
Apocrypha,
 in one
 chapter where∣of
we may spring a whole Covey of Cities, namely these follow∣ing:



1 
Dathema,
 a fortress.


2 Bosora.


3 Bosor.


4 Alema.


5 Chasphor.


6 Mached.


7 Carnaim.


8 Ephron.




The generall character given of these places consisteth principally in
these particulars.




1
 All these were Cities strong and great.


2 Situated al in the
 
Land of Gilead,
 yea in this Tribe of 
Gad, Carnaim



onely excepted, whereof more properly in our next descri∣ption.


3 Inhabited by 
Iews,
 and threatned by the pagan Hoste under

Timotheus,
 that they 
would take and destroy them all in
 one day.




From which last clause we collect that these Cities must be placed
somewhat near together, otherwise, how could an army probably pro∣pound
to dispatch them all in one day? And though the Pagans might
mingle much pride with their malice in projecting things high and hard
to effect, yet surely they mixed some policy with their pride, not to pro∣pound
to themselves meer impossibilities. But the seasonable coming of

Iudas Maccabeus
 with his host frustrated all the Pagans designes.


§ 32. But the City of 
Ephron
 deserves serious consideration, for the sin∣gular
situation thereof. For in 
Maccabeus
 his return from 
Carnaim
 this
strong City stood so in his way, that 
he could not turn from it either to the right
hand or to the left,
 but must needs pass through the midst of it. A place in
so tyrannicall a position may seem an affront to mans naturall liberty.
Yet such was the situation thereof near the
 confluence of 
Iabbok
 and 
Ior∣dan

(where perchance the way railed with 
Morasses
 on either side) and
being a pass of importance, 
Maccabeus
 was onely free to go this or no way.
The 
Ephronites
 sen
ible of their advantage undiscreetly deny him pas∣sage.
Surely if a flying enemy deserve 
a bridge of gold to be given him,
 a potent
foe seriously proffering peaceably to depart, may merit a bridg of silver to
be lent him. But 
Maccabeus
 being denyed forced his way through the city

 
over them that were slain.


§ 33. In the partition of the Land of 
Canaan
 into severall moneths
for 
Solomons
 provisions 
the Tribe of Gad
 fell under three 
Purveyer-ships.




1 Of 
Gebar
 the son of 
Uri,
 who ranged over most of that land,
once the kingdome
 of 
Sihon.


2 Of the Son of 
Geber,
 to whose jurisdiction
 
Ramoth-Gilead
 did
belong.


3 Of 
Abinadab
 the Son of 
Iddo,
 to whom 
Mahanaim
 did pertain.




By 
Mahanaim
 here I understand not onely the 
Levites
 City so named,
(poor purveying for victualls within the walls of that alone)
but a large Territory of the same name round about it. And although
to us it is unknown how far the bounds thereof extended, yet they must
be concluded either very large or extraordinary fruitfull, acquitting it
self as a twelfth part of the Kingdome, and affording Court fare for one
moneth of the year. In the passage to this 
Mahanaim
 on the south (to
retreive a place which otherwise had escaped us) lay 
Bithron,
 a petty
Countrey it seems, through which 
Abner
 passed
 when by night he fled
from 
Ioab.


§ 34. It will here be demanded, that seeing the land was by Gods
own appointment formerly divided into twelve parts, (the twelve
Tribes) adequate to the twelve moneths of the year, why did not 
Solomon



rather make use of this partition, which was 
jure divino,
 then make a new
modell out of his own fancy. It is answered, this later division of the
land, was found most convenient for house-keeping, and so more sub∣servient
to this particular end for which it was ordained.


If that any urge me to give a reason why in this division into 
Purveyer∣ships
Ramoth-Gilead
 distanced some miles off, was added to the jurisdicti∣on
of the Son of 
Geber,
 who was overseer in 
Manasseh,
 thereby mangling
and mutilating the intireness of the Countrey; let such first satisfie me,
why so many shreds and parcells of land (especially in 
Worcester
 & 
He∣reford

shires) are cut off from those Countreys in situation, (yea are sur∣rounded
with other shires) yet belong unto them in jurisdiction as ac∣counted
members thereof. In all these Querees an ordinary eye might at
the first institution discover an apparent reason of such fractions, though
now, because long since 
time out of minde,
 the quickest sight cannot perceive
the cause thereof.


§ 35. The Armes usually assigned to 
Gad
 are 
Gules on a Banner erected
argent a Lion rampant sable:
 grounding their fancy (I can afford it no better
term) on 
Moses
 his blessing;
 
Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad, he dwelleth as
a Lion &c.
 Bu
 how to accommodate the prophecy of 
Iacob
 to this Tribe
of 
Gad,
 a troop shall overcome him, but he shall overcome at last,
 much imploy∣eth
the industry of Divines. Most apply it to the situation of this Tribe,
much exposed to the incursion of the 
Ammonites
 their vexatious neigh∣bours,
till 
at last
 under
 
Iephthah,
 
Saul,
 and chiefly
 
David
 freed from fo∣rein
foes, they possessed their countrey in peace. Others in a mysticall
meaning make 
Gad
 the embleme of 
Gods children,
 who after many inter∣mediate
frights, fights and failings, come off with the conquest 
at last;
 I say 
at last,
 a word which fully recompenseth its long delays in coming,
when come with eternity of continuance.




Here followes the Map of the half Tribe of 
Manasseh
 beyond 
Jorda
.














MANASSEH beyond IORDAN. CHAP. 3.


§ 1. 
M
Anasseh
 eldest Son of 
Ioseph
 by 
Asernath
 daughter of

Potipherah
 Prince-priest of 
On,
 was by his pro∣pheticall
grandfather
 
Iacob
 placed behind 
Ephraim

his younger brother. Not that 
Reuben
-like he was
disinherited for any misdemeanour, but onely so it
pleased al-disposing Providence to transpose him.
However (though inferiour to 
Ephraim
 in power) he grew so great that
thirty
 two thousand two hundred of his body from twenty years old &
upward as able men to goe forth to war came forth of 
Egypt,
 all which
digging their graves in the wildernes by their own infidelity
 
fifty two thou∣sand
seven hundred
 entred the land of 
Canaan.
 Many Worthies were extracted
from this Tribe (for this Countrey was
 conferred upon them in Intu∣ition
to their valour) as 
Gideon,
 and 
Iephthah
 the warlike, 
Iair
 the youn∣ger,
the peaceable Judge of 
Israel, Eliah
 the Prophet; nor must the five

daughters, and coheires of 
Zelophehad,
 be forgotten, who argued their
case so strongly about their inheritance. Bashfulness it self will be bold
rather then lose a rightfull possession, and a good cause when plainly
told, is learnedly pleaded, especially if a meek 
Moses
 or just 
Ioshua
 be the
judge thereof.


§ 2. We are now onely to describe that part of 
Manasseh
 which was
east of 
Iordan.
 Some will say, was it not pity the possessions of this
Tribe should be thus dismembred? Was it not enough that 
Ioseph was

 separated from his brethren,
 but 
Manasseh
 his Son must also be parted from
himself? How came that wisdome who pronounceth it
 
good and plea∣sant
for brethren to live together in unity,
 to cleave this Tribe asunder? But let
such know, that unity in affection may consist with locall separation.
Besides, divine Providence might seem to have a designe herein, that
this Tribe of 
Manasseh
 having a joint interest on both sides of 
Iordan,

might claspe these Countries together: and the 
Manassites
 being (as I may
say) 
Amphibii,
 on both sides of the River, might by visits amongst their


kindred, continue a correspondency and civill communion one with
another.


§ 3. 
Manasseh
 had mount 
Hermon
 and 
Gilead
 on the east, parting it
from the 
Ammonites,
 and 
Ismaelites, Iordan
 on the west, 
Gad
 on the south,

Syria,
 and particularly the kingdomes of 
Geshur
 and 
Maachah
 on the
north. In which compass of ground,
 
threescore Cities with high walls,
gates and bars, besides unwalled towns, were contained.
 Many will be amazed at
this number, & the wonder will seem the greater when they shall reckon
but
 two and twenty Cities in 
Asher,
 nineteen in 
Naphtali,
 seventeen in

Simeon,
 sixteen in 
Issachar,
 & but twelve in 
Zebulun:
 unproportionable that
half a Tribe should have treble the number of Cities to those that were
bigger. All we can say herein is this, that being a frontier Countrey,
and being exposed on the north and east to heathen enemies, it must
have more fenced Cities, then the Tribes on the other side 
Iordan,
 which
were better secured by their situation. Thus the hem is turned in, and
sowed double, to prevent the ravelling out thereof. And if I reck on right,
there be more Castles in our marches betwixt 
Scotland
 and 
Wales,
 then in
all 
England
 besides. However, our eye shall not be evill at 
Manasseh
 be∣cause
Gods was good unto it, who are so far from repining at, that we
rejoyce for the plenty of strong places therein; onely grieving that we
cannot give the Reader an exact account of their names, though we
will endevour our best in the following description.


§ 4. Mount 
Hermon
 is the north-east bound of this Tribe, called by
the 
Sidonians
 Syrion,
 by the 
Amorites Shenir,
 by humane
 writers 
Hippus,

and 
Trachones,
 being a branch of 
Lebanon
 bended south-ward. A stately
strong mountain fixed on firm foundations, and yet the 
voice of the Lord

(understand the thunder with an earthquake) maketh
 
Syrion to skip as
an Unicorne;
 and well may mountains dance when God himself shall
pipe unto them. The
 
dew of Hermon
 is highly commended by 
David,

and brotherly love is compared thereunto, because (whilest heat of
hatred like a drought parcheth all to nothing) fraternall kindness dew∣like
gives refreshment and increase. But how this 
dew of Hermon fell upon
the hill of Sion
 (mountains an hundred miles asunder) so troubled Saint

Augustine,
 that at last leaving the literall sense, he is fain to fly to a mysti∣call
meaning. Others interpret that the 
dew of Hermon fell upon the hill of
Sion,
 because the fruitfull flocks fatted on that mountain came after∣wards
to be sacrificed at 
Ierusalem;
 which is but a harsh construction;
as if one should say, 
The fruitfulness of Linconcolne-shire which falls on London,

because the fatted cattel thereof are sold and eaten in the City. But whilest
sundry Interpreters have severall wit-engines to draw these two moun∣tains
together, our last translation saves their needless paines, rendring it,

As the dew of Hermon, & as
 as the dew 
that descended upon the mountains of Zion.

Indeed it is the same specificall, though not individuall dew which
lighteth on both mountains, flowing from heaven the same fountain,
though falling on earth in severall channels.



§ 5. Now as 
Hermon
 is a chain of continued hills, so a principall
link thereof is the mountain 
Amana.
 Christ courting his 
Spouse
 inviteth
her 
to look from
 the top of
 
Amana.
 Some conceive thereby 
Amanus
 a
mountain in 
Cilicia
 is meant; but seeing 
Solomon
 clean through that
Poem, maketh use of onely native similitudes (whereof a self-sufficiency
in his own land) it is improbable that herein he did borrow a forein
and exotick expression. Know also, that the region hereabouts is called

Trachonitis
 or 
Sharp
land
 in English, from the steepness of many pointed
hills (in shape not unlike the Rocks called 
Needles
 near the 
Isle of Wight
)
wherewith this countrey abounded; and it was a moity of the
 Te∣trarch-ship
of 
Philip
 the brother of 
Herod.


§ 6. South of 
Hermon
 lay mount 
Gilead,
 famous for the interview of

Laban
 and 
Iacob:
 the former keen with anger (save that God in a
 vision
took off his edge) overtaking 
Iacob
 charged him with a double action
of felony, for stealing himself, and his Gods away without his privity.
The first, 
Iacob
 confessed, yet pleaded not guilty to the second, but traver∣sed
his innocency. 
Hue and Cry
 is made in vain after the thief and felons
goods, (or Gods if you please) for she, whose conscience would per∣mit
her to carry away, cunning did perswade her to conceal them. 
Ia∣cob

thus cleared (as it were by Proclamation) of Defendant turns Plain∣tiffe,
accusing the Accuser for his false accusation. At last all winds off
in a good agreement, and an Instrument is drawn up betwixt them,
not in paper but in stone, interchangeably sealed with solemn oaths.
The Condition whereof, was to this effect; 
That if either of them should
passe that place to doe any act of hostility to other, he should forfeit his fidelity, and
be liable to divine justice for his perjury.


§ 7. This Pillar and heap of stones had a threefold name imposed
on it, called



1 By 
Laban,
 Iegar Sahadutha,
 that is in the 
Aramite
 tongue, 
A heap of
witnesse.


2 By 
Iacob,
 Galeed,
 the same in effect in Hebrew.


3 By both 
Mizpah;
 that is, a 
Watch-tower, Iacob
 giving the name,
and 
Laban
 the occasion thereof by that his expression, 
The Lord

 watch betwixt thee and me.




Here was abundant caution, three names and two languages, and yet
nothing too much. For 
Iacob
 having formerly been sensible of 
Labans

notorious shuffling with him, knew the best way to finde sure was to
binde sure; and 
Laban
 being guilty, and therefore jealous, thought no
security sufficient. And therefore in their mutuall suspicions a Tripli∣cate
was used in naming the places, that a threefold cable might not
be broken.


§ 8. 
Gilead
 was at first onely appropriated to that heap and pillar,
whence the name may seem to be translated to the adjacent mountains,
and thence transmitted to the valley in the east of those mountains, and


thence imparted to some eminent persons born in that valley. For as

 
Gilead
 Son of 
Machir,
 grand-child of 
Manasseh,
 being born in 
Egypt,
 so
called by a Propheticall 
Prolepsis,
 foretelling that his posterity should
possess the Countrey of 
Gilead;
 so
 
Gilead
 the Father of 
Iephthah, Gilead

of 
Gilead,
 seems to take his denomination from the Countrey possessed.
Thus as the
 Psalmist observes 
some called their lands after their own names,

and some it seems were called after the name of their lands.


§ 9. A fruitfull Countrey 
Gilead
 was, till the people thereof were in∣fected
with Idolatry, growen so frequent therein, that the Prophet com∣plains,

Their
 Altars were as heaps in the furrows of the field.
 Thus falling
into Gods displeasure they quickly fell under their enemies disposall.

The Syrians of Damascus threshing them with
 instruments of Iron, and the
 Am∣monites
ripping up their women with child that they might enlarge their border.
 This
latter cruelty seems done in revenge of 
Davids
 usage of the 
Ammonites
 in
taking of 
Rabbah,
 putting them under saws and harrows &c.
 And although
some hundreds of years were betwixt that action of 
David
 and this of
the 
Ammonites,
 yet we know malice hath a strong memory, long to re∣tain
and at last to return injuries offered unto it.


§ 10. Under the hills of 
Gilead
 (famous for flocks of goats, to which
for thickness and whiteness the hair of the Spouse is
 compared) lay

Rogelim
 a Manor of 
Barzillai
 the 
Gileadite.
 This was he who so bounti∣fully
victualled 
David
 at 
Mahanaim,
 so civilly waited on him to 
Iordan,

so equally requested, and so easily obtained a 
Writ of ease
 from Court at∣tendance,
being now
 fourscore years of age: having first bequeathed
his Court-pleasures to 
Chimham
 his Son (neither covetous to keep them
himself, nor envious that another should enjoy them) because such ex∣cusable
vanities might become his green youth, which would be bur∣densome
to the withered winter of his Father. 
Pella
 seems to be herea∣bouts,
whither many Christians warned by many prodigies fled for
shelter from 
Ierusalem,
 before the 
Romans
 besieged it. As we congratu∣late
their thus preventing persecution according to Christs
 precept, so
we cannot but condole, that the same
 persons were afterwards poiso∣ned
with hereticall opinions, contrary to the express word of God, and
became Apostate 
Nazarites.
 Somewhat more north is
 
Lodebar
 the pos∣session
of 
Machir,
 a bountifull benefactor to 
David
 during his distress,
and Guardian to
 
Mephibosheth
 in his minority; and 
Thisbe
 the birth∣place
of 
Eliah
 the Prophet, the 
Iohn Baptist
 of the old Testament. Great
was the resemblance betwixt their persons and preaching (all simili∣tudes
run like 
Pharaoh
's Charets in the red-sea,
 wanting some wheeles)
especially because both were born in bad times, when the world was
generally infected with wickedness, both contented with plain clothes,
and course fare, undaunted in reproving the faults of Princes, and impla∣cably
persecuted for the same.


§ 11. But the principall City in 
Gilead
 was 
Mizpah
 the place of 
Ieph∣thah's




 habitation. This is he whom his brethren banished for a
 Ba∣stard;
but the elders of 
Gilead
 oppressed by the 
Ammonites,
 brought back
for their
 Generall. When they felt their own woe, they began to see

Iephthah's
 worth, formerly exiled for his Fathers fault, but now restored
for his own abilities. Vertue once in an age will work her own ad∣vancement,
and when such as hate it shall chance to need it, they will
be forced to prefer it. To 
Mizpah Iephthah
 returned, though a conque∣rour,
yet a captive and a prisoner to his own rash vow, 
to sacrifice what∣soever
came first forth of the doors of his house;
 it so happening that his onely
daughter 
met him with a virgin-quire and musick,
 which was sad in the
close. Here Divines both for number and learning are almost
equally divided,
 some avouching her really sacrificed according to
the letter of the text, whereof some footsteps in the Fable of 
Agamemnon

sacrificing 
Iphigenia
 (haply corrupted for 
Iephthagenia
 or 
Iephtha's
 daugh∣ter:)
others
 maintaining that she was onely sequestred to perpetuall
virginity. If any demand my judgment in this difference, I seasonably
remember how one being asked in the 
Massacre of Paris,
 whether he
was a 
Catholick
 or an 
Hugonite,
 answered 
he was a Physician.
 My return must
be in this work, I am onely a Chorographer, and the controversie in
hand concerns matter of fact, not of place, proper onely to us for this
present.


§ 12. East of 
Mizpah
 lay the plain of 
Mizpah. Ioshua
 having con∣quered
the Kings of 
Canaan
 (at the waters of 
Merom
 in the next Tribe)
pursued them hither on the east and to
 
Mizrepoth
maim
 near 
Sidon
 west∣ward.
A chace with a vengeance all the latitude of the land, the 
Ca∣naanites

flying as far as sea or mountains would give them leave: so
that their flight may pass for a 
Scale of miles
 for the breadth of this Coun∣trey,

so smitten untill they left them none
 remaining,
 understand it, not in a con∣siderable
body to make any resistance.


§ 13. So much of 
Gilead.
 We come now to 
Bashan:
 for these two
provinces did the Tribe of 
Manasseh
 contain, though it is impossible
accurately to distinguish their bounds. 
Bashan
 was a grazing countrey
(as indeed all 
Canaan
 east of 
Iordan
 was fitter for 
Abel
 then 
Cain,
 for
pasturage then tillage) antiently called the 
Land
 
of Giants;
 which though
now extirpated, 
Og
 being the last of that race, yet retained some foot∣steps
thereof in the strength and greatness of her



1 
Oakes,
 whereof
 oares were made for the gallies of 
Tyre.


2 
Rams,
 of the breed of 
Bashan,
 being the fattest and fairest of
their kinde.


3 
Bulls,
 so often mentioned in Scripture. But by
 
Davids metapho∣ricall
bulls of Bashan,
 strong, sturdy, curst, cruell men are under∣stood.




This Province was subdivided into severall petty lands: as, first, the

La
d
 of Argob
 on the north next 
Syria.
 Secondly,
 
Bashan-avoth-Iair:



where taking the first word for the 
Genus
 and the two latter for the

Difference,
 we have the exact definition of the Countrey.


§ 14. 
Iair
 was a fortunate name in the family of 
Manasseh,
 and we
must be carefull not to confound two eminent men of that name.




1 
Iair
 the elder, contemporary with 
Moses,
 who, when the field-forces
of 
Og
 were utterly destroied, smote the
 small towns there∣of
(being threescore in number, as 
Ioshua
 counted them) and
called them 
Bashan-Avoth-Iair,
 that is, the Cities of 
Iair
 in 
Bashan.


2 
Iair
 the younger, a peaceable Judge in 
Israel
 immediately before

Iephthah,
 who as he came many years in age short of the former,
so the number of his Cities were but half so many, 
viz.
 thirty,
which he left to his thirty sons, calling them also 
Avoth-Iair.




It is further recorded of his thirty sons that they rode on thirty
 
Asse∣colts,
i. e.
 they were itinerant
 Judges, say some, in their respective places,
it being improper that they in their severall circuits should



1 
Goe on foot.
 Authority would be contemned if not somewhat
heightned above the comon people.


2 Or ride on prancing steeds. Marshall law may be so mounted,
where the heels of the horses are as terrible to poor people, as the
face of the rider.


3 Or ride on swift Coursers; seeing no such hast to execute suspe∣cted
innocence.


4 Or be housed in covered chariots; which is a kinde of engrossing
of justice, shutting that up, to which all ought to have open ac∣cess.


5 But ride on 
Asses:
 partly that Petitioners, though lame and weak,
might keep pace with them on the way when relating their
grievances; and partly by that patient creature to shew the slow
but sure proceeding of justice; and indeed the Judges foot-pace
to the 
sentence
 is the accused parties post-speed to his grave.




We finde among these thirty cities, but one of them named, which is

 
Camon,
 wherein the body of 
Iair
 was buried. And it is probable, that

Ira
 the
 
Iairite
 so high in favour about King 
David,
 was an inhabitant
of this countrey.


§ 15. More south lay 
Ashteroth-karnaim,
 or in English, the 
two horned
Ashteroth,
 either so named from some forked building, or street therein;

(Horn-church
 in 
Essex,
 and 
Horn-castle
 in 
Lincolne-shire
 so called on the
like occasion) or because the Idol 
Ashteroth,
 that is, the Moon horned in
her waxing or waning, was worshipped therein; or lastly because a
fair and gallant City, and all strength, mirth, and jollity are called 
horns

in the Hebrew. Yet may we say to the men of 
Ashteroth
 in the words of
the
 Psalmist, 
Set not up your horns so high, neither speak presumptuous words.

Horns, which first were well blunted by 
Chedorlaomer,
 when he
 smote
the 
Rephaims
 or Giants in 
Ashteroth-karnaim,
 and afterwards were bro∣ken


quite off, when
 
Og
 King of 
Bashan
 who reigned in this City was
overthrown. For hard by is 
Edrei
 another City wherein 
Og
 resided,
and neer which he bid battell to the children of 
Israel
 when he with all
his Giant-like race, which peopled this place, was extinguished. For
though the 
Countrey of Pigmies
 be a Poets-tale, this
 
Land of Giants
 is a
Scripture-truth. However, no eye can now distinguish betwixt the ashes
of Giants, and dust of dwarfs, death having long since levelled all alike
in the grave.


§ 16. Such remarkable places as remain in this Tribe, will easily
be found out, if we follow the stream of 
Iordan,
 and such rivolets as pay
tribute thereunto. 
Iordan
 having newly recovered himself out of the
waters of 
Merom
 into a competent channell, receiveth from the east

 
Hermon
 a small brook running by 
Golan,
 a
 
Levites
 City of refuge,
(whence the neighbouring countrey in 
Iosephus
 called 
Gaulonitis
) and
after 
Iordan
 falleth betwixt 
Capernaum
 and 
Chorazin
 into 
the sea of Galilee.

This 
Chorazin
 was the place where Christs miracles and preaching were
sowen so thick; and where the peoples thankfulness for the one, and
practise of the other, came up so thin, that it caused that curse,
 
Woe be to
thee Chorazin &c.
 A woe, which at this day hath wasted it from a popu∣lous
city to a ruinous village. As for their conceit, that 
Antichrist
 should
be born in 
Chorazin,
 I take it to be a meer Monkish device, to divert mens
eyes, from seeking him in the right place where he is to be found.


§ 17. More south-ward the brook 
Cherith
 (having viewed at some
distance
 
Beeshterah,
 afterwards called 
Bosrah,
 a city of the 
Levites;
 called
also
 
Ashtaroth;
 And it is questionable, whether this, or 
Ashtaroth-Car∣naim

(whereof formerly) were the Metropolis of 
Og
 King of 
Bashan
) run∣neth
into the 
Sea of Galilee.
 By the banks hereof 
the Ravens brought Eliah

bread and flesh in the morning and evening, and he drank of the river.
 It seems

Dinners
 are but innovations; whilest 
break-fasts,
 and 
suppers
 are mens
most ancient and naturall meales. Here 
Eliah
 having the sub
ance of
sustenance, cared not for the ceremony of a Table, or complement of a
Carpet. How little will preserve life, but how much must maintain
luxury! 
After a while this River dried up.
 Collect not thence that the brook
was inconsiderably little, but that the drought had been extraordinari∣ly
long.


§ 18. As for the cities of 
Hippus, Iulias,
 and 
Gamala,
 whereof as deep
silence in Scripture, as frequent mention in 
Iosephus,
 it is enough to
name them. In the last of these
 
Iosephus
 reports 
Iudas of Galilee
 to be
born, that grand impostor, who
 
in the days of the taxing
 pretended himself
the Champion of popular liberty, to protect them from such unreaso∣nable
payments. Multitudes of men flocked after him; for, spare their
purses, and win the hearts of the Vulgar. But 
Iudas
 having go
ten
power, fell a pillaging all people, taking from them the whole griest of
their estate, so to save the owners from paying toll unto Cesar. How


smooth and tender are the gums of Infant-treason, but oh how sharp
are the teeth thereof when once grown to full greatness! However, he
and his followers came afterward unto confusion, and is the second
instance alleadged by 
Gamaliel
 to prove, that
 
councells which are not of God
will come to nought.
 The Son of 
Geber
 was 
Solomons
 purveyer in this half
Tribe of 
Manasseh.


§ 19. The Armes assigned to 
Ioseph
 are, a 
tree proper
 growing by a
Well, founded on the words of 
Iacob Gen. 49. 22. David
 may seem hence
to have borrowed his Simile of a blessed man,
 
He shall be like a tree plan∣ted
by the waters side.
 But 
Ioseph
 had more, not onely a Well before to re∣fresh,
but a wall behind to support him, and 
his boughs
 (may Heralds
word it in their own language) 
grew over the wall.
 Partly foretelling the
fruitfulness of 
Iosephs
 posterity, and partly pointing at the particular posi∣sion
of his inheritance. For, as some think, 
Iordan
 was the wall on the east
of the Land of 
Canaan
 properly so called; and the children of 
Ioseph
 ha∣ving
their root planted, and main body growing on the other side of
the river, spread their branches over this wall, half 
Manasseh
 having his
portion on the east side of 
Iordan.
 To conclude, though those Armes did
generally belong to the whole house of 
Ioseph,
 yet custome hath appro∣priated
them to 
Manasseh
 alone: other Ensigns being assigned to 
Ephraim,

whereof God willing hereafter.






Here the Map of 
Naphtali
 is to be inserted.













THE TRIBE OF NAPHTALI. CHAP. 4.


§ 1. 
N
Aphtali
 Son of 
Iacob
 by 
Bildah
 his Concubine was
multiplied during the aboad of his posterity in

Egypt,
 to fifty and three thousand
 four hun∣dred.
All which dying in the desert, their Sons
being fourty five thousand foure
 hundred en∣tred
the Land of 
Canaan.
 A Tribe acquitting it
self considerable in relation to the rest, though
we meet but with two, or rather but with one and a half 
Glories
 thereof.
The former
 
Barak
 the son of 
Abinoham,
 who (acted by 
Deborah
) did
act so valiantly against 
Sisera.
 The half-one 
Hiram
 (a
 
Naphtalite
 though
his
 Father was a man of 
Tyre
) that curious Artificer in 
Solomons Temple.

Other eminent persons (though unknown) doubtless were of this
Tribe, for in their martiall addresses to 
David
 in 
Hebron,
 none appea∣red
in more excellent equipage for number and warlike accoutrements:


And of Naphtali a thousand Captains, and with them with shield and speare, thirty
and seven thousand.


§ 2. This Tribe bordered (plainly intimated though not expressed
in the bounding thereof) on mount 
Libanus
 on the north,
 and 
reacheth
 (as
is plainly expressed) 
to Zebulun on the south-side, and to Asher on the west-side, and
to Iudah upon Iordan toward the Sun-rising.
 True this must needs be, for Truth
hath said it; the last words present us with a seeming impossibility.
For how long an arme must 
Naphtali
 make to reach to 
Iudah,
 over the
Tribes of 
Zebulun, Issachar, Manasses, Ephraim,
 and 
Benjamin
 interposed,

Naphtali
 being distanced about an hundred miles from 
Iudah?
 Here some
Commentators being not able to quell, never raise this objection: a
commendable discretion in them, if unconcerned to meddle therewith;
but seeing they professe their calling to be a satisfaction of difficulties,
it is in them an unexcusable lazinesse. But let us hear what the learned
resolve in this case.




1
 Some fancy a small 
Lace
 of land (or rather a 
thread
 for the nar∣rowness


thereof) whereby (though invisible in Maps) 
Naphtali

is tyed unto 
Iudah.


2
 Others, that 
Naphtali
 reacheth to 
Iudah upon Iordan,
 not imme∣diately
in confines, but mediately by commerce; because the
river 
Iordan
 runneth thence unto 
Iudah,
 and so they had the con∣veniency
of Traffique into that Tribe.


3 Others more likely, that 
Naphtali
 reached to
 
Iudah on Iordan;
 be∣cause

Iudah
 as a 
Tribe in chief
 had the 
Royalty
 of the river 
Iordan,
 as
fishing, fowling, and perchance the impost on all vessells, sailing
from the fountain to the fall thereof.


4 Let me cast my Mite into this Treasury. What if this 
Iudah
 was
but the name of a town or village, and therefore that addition,

Iudah upon Iordan,
 given for distinction sake?




However 
Masius
 no less learned, then modest, pleaseth me with this
resolution. 
In rebus tantâ vetustate obliteratis, & quae exploratè percipi nullâ jam
ratione possunt, satius est non multa dicere, quàm incertissima pro veris absque ullâ
dubitatione afferre.
 Such difficulties were not casually scattered, but pur∣posely
placed to improve our industry, and teach us humility. For the
best answer mans wit can produce, is no 
salve
 to the Text, which of it
self is whole and entire, but a 
plaister
 onely to our own craized under∣standings.


§ 3. For the fruitfulnesse of this countrey, hear what 
Moses
 prophecy∣eth.


O Naphtali satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the Lord.

See also what was performed. For the land about 
Laish,
 which
was in the confines of this Tribe is thus charactered,
 
A place where there
is no want of any thing that is in the Earth.
 
Iosephus
 being almost this Country∣man,
saith, 
: 
One may call this Countrey the Ambi∣tion
of nature. Strabo
 a Pagan giveth it the Epithets of 
,

A well natured land and bearing all commodities.
 But the best fruit it bare was
our Saviour himself: by his corporall presence much conversant here;
this Tribe being the Theatre whereon his most remarkeable Miracles
were acted.


§ 4. From the foot of 
Libanus
 to the sea of 
Galilee
 may be allowed
thirty five miles. Equall whereunto, by the favour of 
Iordan
 running
crooked, (though northernly more narrow) is the breadth thereof,
from east to west. In the time of our Saviour this Tribe was parcell of
two Tetrarchies. The north-east part thereof, belonged to 
Iturea.
 The

 Poet takes notice of the plenty of 
Yew
 in this Province.

—Itureos taxi torquentur in arcus.


Yew which in Iturea growes


Is neately bended into Bowes.

Hence their inhabitants became excellent Archers: and pity it was,
rhat their arrows were so often shot at a wrong mark, to kill and rob
passengers in their journey. 
Strabo
 calls the 
Itureans
 generally 
, and


their Countrey in some sort may seem accessary to their felonies (the
Receiver is bad as a thief) which, as the foresaid Author observes, in
her caves, woods, and inaccessible mountains protected those Robbers
from justice proceeding against them. Insomuch that the 
Romans
 were
fain to keep Souldiers in Garison against them (but who kept any a∣gainst
the souldiers?) So that betwixt both, 
Iturea
 at that time may be
conceived sufficiently miserable.


§ 5. The south-west of 
Naphtali
 was accounted part of 
Galilee the up∣per,

otherwise called 
Galilee of the Gentiles,
 because, as some conceive, the
people therein were commixed with heathens, and (being far from

Ierusalem
) were more drossie 
Iews
 then the rest. Which is a most errone∣ous
opinion. For how improbable is it, that our Saviour, who sending
his Disciples to preach gave them instructions,
 
Goe not into the way of the
Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter yee not,
 and himself never
stayed in 
Samaria,
 save as he took it in his necessary passage in or from

 
Iudea;
 should choose 
Galilee,
 if so debased with the mixture of 
Gentiles,

for the place of his principall and constant residence? Far more true is it
that it was called 
Galilaea Gentium,
 that is, 
Galilee
 the populous, because of
the multitudes of people, especially near the sea, wherein was 
Decapolis

(a member of 
Galilee.
) And there one city, for want of room, may seem
to tread on another.


§ 6. Before we come to the particular description of this Tribe, we
will first dispatch out of the way, nine limitary Towns (which accor∣dingly
are figured in the Map) and this will much facilitate our pro∣ceeding
in the rest.




1 
Heleph,
 in the northern bounds of this Tribe, from which the
eastern coasts thereof southwardly are described.


2 
Allon,
 that is in English, oake (as 
Oakeham
 in 
Rutland
) so named
from plenty of those trees growing therein.


3 
Zaanaim.
 Note that 
Tremellius
 maketh these two latter, but one
entire place, reading it the 
Oake-wood of Zaanaim.


4 
Adami.
 Which as 
Ruthland
 in 
Flint-shire,
 probably was so named
from the redness of the earth.


5 
Nekeb:
 this is a ditch, where we may conceive 
Iordan
 was let
out for the more convenient watering of other ground. And
have we not more then twenty 
Dittons
 or 
Ditch-tons
 on the same
occasion in England?


6 
Iabneel:
 different from one of the same name in the Tribe of 
Dan.


7 Lakum.


8 Aznoth-Tabor.


9 Hukkok.




We are not bound to beleeve all these nine to have been Cities of con∣siderable
strength, or greatness, as not so note-worthy in themselves as in
their situation. Because (though perchance otherwise poor villages)


they stood in the borders of this Tribe. Thus low shrubs growing on
high hills, or crooked thorn-trees set by the high-way side, are more con∣spicuous
in the eye, and frequent in the mouths of travellers, then streigh∣ter
and fairer trees which are obscure in the midst of the wood.


§ 7. To come to the particular description thereof; Amongst the
mountains of 
Libanus,
 we meet with one of eminent note, not onely
having a name peculiar to it self, but which from it hath also denomi∣nated
the adjacent Countrey. This is mount 
Paneas,
 wherein there is a
deep hole or cave. And though places of this kind commonly have
more horrour then pleasure in them, this, besides its naturall beauty,
was adorned with artificiall structures in, and about it. Herein also was
an unsoundable spring of water, conceived by some to be the primitive
fountain of 
Iordan.
 Yet
 
Iosephus
 tells us of 
Phiala,
 a spring above two
hundred furlongs off (and therefore out of the bounds of this Tribe)
into which 
Philip
 the Tetrarch cast cha
e to try the experiment, and it
was rendred up again in the streame of 
Iordan.
 Whence he concluded,
that this river entertained an underground intelligence with that foun∣tain.
But we are not to take notice where rivers are secretly conceived,
but where they are visibly born: and therefore date the originall thereof
from the apparent heads of 
Ior
 and 
Dan:
 which keeping themselves sole
and single for a short time, are soon wedded together. And from the
confluence of their names and streams, 
Iordan
 is begotten.


§ 8. To pass by Scripture commendations, it is called by
 
olinus,
eximiae suavitatis amnis,
 a river of excellent sweetness. But as if Rivers, as
well as Men, were too prone to be proud of their good properties, it is
very subject to
 overswell the banks; in which notion perhaps, it is
also called by the aforesaid 
Solinus, Ambitiosus amnis, an haughty and ambiti∣ous
river.
 But what saith the
 Prophet? 
The pride of Iordan is spoiled:
 name∣ly,
in some extraordinary drought (and thence dearth) which he there
foretelleth. To keep the golden mean; As 
Iordan
 sometimes must be
acknowledged to mount too high, so 
Naaman
 depressed it too low in
his valuation: whose ignorance and passion preferred
 
Abana
 and 
Phar∣phar,

the rivers of 
Damascus,
 before it.


§ 9. At the aforesaid confluence stands the famous city of 
Laish,

which at first it seems was a free State, living in subjection to none, and
yet in slavery to their own intemperance. They were
 
far from the Zidoni∣ans,

that is, as
 one measureth it, about thirty miles: half that distance be∣ing
too much to receive thence seasonable succour in their suddain sur∣prize
by the 
Danites.
 In taking which town, the
 prophecy of 
Moses

was fulfilled, 
Dan is a Lions whelp he shall leape from Bashan.
 It seems that
the 
Danites
 came on the east-side of the City, and might for a time secret∣ly
repose themselves in 
Bashan.
 Whence, on a suddain, Lion-like 
(saliant

in his Posture, when he seizeth on his prey) they leaped on the city, and
were felt being on them before seen coming towards them. The City


was afterwards called 
Dan,
 and the 
Danites
 possessed a tract or territory
of ground, which otherwise seems to lie within the Tribe of 
Naphtali,

but was not possessed by them.


§ 10. But as we must praise the prowesse and policy, so we detest the
Idolatry of these 
Danites,
 who hither brought, and here erected, the gra∣ven
Image stoln from
 
Micah,
 worshiping it 
untill the day of the captivity
of the land:
 that is, as
 
Tremellius
 well expoundeth it, till the Ark was ta∣ken
captive and restored, when there followed a generall reformation
in the days of 
Samuel.
 This place
 then purged, was not long after de∣filed
again with the same sin. For here 
Ieroboam
 set up one of his golden
Calves,
 
making Priests of the meanest of the people.
 And although where a
Calfe is the God, a wispe of Hay is good enough to be the Priest, yet
hainous was the offence, because done by 
Ieroboam
 in the disgrace of Re∣ligion.
The erection of these Calves was pretended for the ease of the
people of 
Israel,
 to spare their tedious travell thrice a year to 
Ierusalem;

but in effect occasioned that they were sent a longer journey on a worse
errant, even into irrecoverable captivity. Thus to spare a step in the path
of piety, is to spend many in the ready road to misery.


§ 11. In the time of our Saviour, this 
Dan
 was called 
Cesarea-Philippi,

built in honour of 
Tiberius Cesar
 by 
Philip
 the Tetrarch. Who in so name∣ing
it, as wise to remember himself, was also mannerly to prefer the
Emperour. This 
Philip
 being Tetrarch of
 
Iturea,
 and 
Trachonitis,
 made
this 
Cesarea
 (as conveniently seated betwixt both) the place of his prin∣cipall
residence. Neare this
 place, 
Peter
 gave 
Christ
 that excellent testi∣mony,
of his 
being the Son of God.
 As for the two statues of melted brasse
which here are said to be set up by that woman, whose Fluxe of bloud
Christ cured, the one resembling our Saviour, the other her self, in hum∣ble
posture touching the hem of his garment, I had rather the Reader
receive it from the
 Authours themselves, then my relation. Chiefly be∣cause
it seems improbable, that she, who so lately had
 sepent all her
substance upon Physicians, should so quickly recrute her self, as to be
able to goe to the cost of such a Monument.


§ 12. Leaving now the territory of 
Dan,
 we enter on 
Naphtali;
 and

Iordan
 running hence, after some miles expatiateth it self into the wa∣ters
of 
Merom
 or the 
Samoc
onite-lake.
 This was a Sea in winter, and in
Sommer a thicket of reeds, affording shelter to Lions, and Wolves, and
(which now a days are more dangerous to travellers, then either) wild

Arabians. Behold
 (saith the
 Prophet) 
He shall come up like a Lion from the
swelling of Iordan,
 that is, most fierce and furious; who having lodged
there quietly all sommer in the shade, is vexed to be rouzed by the rising
of the waters in winter: and, therefore is ready to revenge this wrong
on the next object he meets. Near these waters, 
Ioshua
 gave that famous
overthrow to
 
Iabin senior
 King of the 
Canaanites
 pursuing the chace as
far as 
Zidon.
 On the west of this lake, where 
Daphnis
 a rivolet falleth


into it, they place 
Riblah,
 accounted a terrestriall Paradise, for the sweet
situation thereof. But grant it pleasant in it self, it was a sad place to
King
 
Zed
kiah,
 who having first beheld the slaughter of his Sons, had
here his own eyes bored out. Thus mans tyranny accomplisheth Gods
justice, whilest 
Zedekiah
 had now leasure enough to bethink himself
how he deserved this punishment, who indevored to put out the eyes
of 
Israel,
 by persecuting the Prophets, and
 imprisoning the Seers there∣of.
Afterwards, 
Iordan
 recovering it self out of the lake, and contented
with a competent stream, is passable at the ford of 
Iacob,
 so called because
tradition reports that Patriarch there to have
 gone over this river with
the company of God and his staffe. At this day there is a
 beautifull
bridge built over, retaining the name of 
Iacobs bridge,
 kept in excellent re∣paire
(as being the high-way betwixt 
Damascus
 and 
Ierusalem.
) And well
may t
e Turkes afford it, seeing the unconscionable toll, which they
extort of Christian passengers for 
Caphar
 or custome, will serve almost
to build all the arches thereof with silver.


§ 13. Here let us hold a while, and desiring to please all palats, let
us temper the harshness of old matters, with the mixture of a modern
passage. If the Reader should ever travell this way from 
Damascus
 to 
Ie∣rusalem

and so into 
Egypt,
 he may repose himself for a night in the 
Cave

east of this bridge, on the other side 
Iordan.
 A 
Cave
 is a publick building
erected by some devout Turk in nature of an Inne, for the benefit of
travellers, of more or less receipt & conveniency according to the bounty
or fancy of the founder. But here the guest must be his own host to enter∣tain
himself, seeing generally nothing but a bare lodging and water, is
provided for him. And though we pity the Readers bad lodging this
night, where (if not bringing better accommodations with him) he
and his Camell must be bedfellowes in straw; yet we promise him next
day a pleasant way and handsome entertainment. For about seven miles
off he shall pass by 
Cave Ioseph,
 where a Well will be shewed him full of

 water, and adorned with marble Pillars, which common tradition a∣voucheth
to be the pit wherein 
Ioseph
 was put, and a learned
 
Frier
 very
zealously stickleth for the truth thereof, though indeed the story is confu∣ted
both by the distance and nature of the place. For it is sixty miles
from 
Dothan
 near
 
Sechem,
 where 
Iosephs brethren
 kept their sheep. Be∣sides,
that pit had no moisture in it (save what fell from the eyes of 
Ioseph
)
whereas this is full of water, so that 
Iosephs
 dreams▪ had been but dreams
if put therein. But it is as good as a bait to tired travellers (whose cre∣dulity
is swifter then the Camels they ride on) to be refreshed in the
way with such relations. Some twelve miles off, the reader may lodge
in a convenient 
Cave
 called 
Minium
 by the Moors, but by the Turkes


Missia:
 and if early up next morning, may, going south-westward, be∣fore
noon enter the Tribe of 
Zebulun.
 Where we may in due time over∣take
him, and hereafter give him larger direction for his travell.



§ 14. From 
Iacobs
 bridge the river 
Iordan
 sees nothing memorable
besides rich meddows and pleasant pastures, untill he falleth into the
sea of 
Cinnereth,
 so called (say some) because in form not unlike a
 harp:
as indeed an active fancy in point of resemblance will fashion any thing
to any thing. How well the similitude suits, the Reader will best judge
when hereafter he shall behold the entire proportion of this Sea in the
Tribe of 
Zebul
,
 where he may feed his fill on the dimensions and se∣verall
names thereof; till which time to stay his stomach, we here
present him with such a parcell of this sea-lake, as falls to the share of

Naphtali.
 At the influxe of 
Iordan
 into this Sea, stood the once famous
City of 
Capernaum,
 called 
Christs
 own City. Note by the way, 
Christ
 had
three Cities which may be called his own (if seven contended for 
Ho∣mer,

well may three be allowed to 
Christ) Bethlehem
 where he was born,

Nazareth
 where conceived and bred, and 
Capernaum
 where
 he dwelt,
more then probably in the house of 
Simon Peter
 though born in 
Bethlehem.


§ 15. This 
Capernaum
 was the Magazine of 
Christs
 Miracles. Here
was healed the servant of that good
 
Centurion:
 who though a 
Gentile
 out∣faithed

Israel
 it self, concluding from his own authority over his Souldi∣ers,
that 
Christ
 by a more absolute power, as Lord high Marshall of all
maladies, without his personall presence, could by his bare word of
command, order any disease to march or retreat at his pleasure. Here

Simon Peters wives mother
 was cured of a
 Fever, and
 here such as brought
the man sick of the Palsie, not finding a door on the floor, made one on
the Roof (Love will creep, but Faith will climb where it cannot goe)
let him down with cords, his bed bringing him in, which presently he
carried out being perfectly cured.
 Here also 
Christ
 restored the daugh∣ter
of 
Iairus
 to life, and in the way as he went (each Parenthesis of our
Saviours motion is full of heavenly matter, and his 
obiter
 more to the
purpose, then our 
iter
) he cured the 
Woman
 of her fluxe of bloud, with
the touch of his garment. But amongst all these and more wonders,
the greatest was the ingratitude of the people of 
Capernaum,
 justly occasi∣oning
our 
Saviours
 sad prediction, 
And
 thou Capernaum which art exalted
to heaven shalt be brought down to hell; for if the mighty works which have been
done in thee, had been done in Tyre and S
don, they would have repented long 
goe in
sackecloth and ashes.
 O sad strapado of the soul, to be hoised up so high,
and then cast down suddenly so low, enough to disjoint all the powers
thereof in peeces!
 
Capernaum
 at this day is a poor village scarce consisting
of seven fishermens Cottages.


§ 16. Some furlongs west-ward from this City stood the 
Receipt of
custome,
 whence 
Matthew
 was
 called from a Publican to be an Apostle.
In 
Capernaum
 afterwards the
 
Toll-gatherers
 did civilly demand of 
Peter,
Doth not your Master pay tribute?
 It being questionable in point of law,
whether 
Christ
 were legally liable to such payments. And l
t us inquire
whence the doubt did arise.


Was it because he



1 Being a Physician, (such persons of publick im∣ployment
for generall good were often exempted
from taxes) who gave his paines gratis to others,
it was but equall he should be priviledged from
such pecuniary burdens?


2 Being poor, was under value in the Excise-book?
And where nothing is to be had the Emperour
must lose his right. Yea generally Almes folk
who live on the charity of others (such the con∣dition
of our
 Saviour) are not to be rated.


3 Being an inmate or under-tenant in the house of

Peter,
 the question was, whether 
Peter
 or 
Christ

was to pay the taxation?




This last is most probable. For our 
Saviour
 taking order for the dis∣charging
of the debt, 
Give the money
 (saith he to S
t
. 
Peter) unto them
 for me
and thee.
 As rates in 
London
 are divided betwixt Land-lord and Tenant.
Hence 
Peter
 was sent to sea, where a fish, which probably had plunde∣red
a peece of money out of the Pocket of some shipwracked fisher∣man,
lost his life for the fact, and the felons goods found in him were
justly forfeited to 
Christ,
 Lord Paramount both of sea and soil.


§ 17. Going forward along the shoare, some will be so positive as to
point at the place where after his resurrection, 
Christ
 took his repast with
his Disciples on bread and broiled fish; yet we finde no express menti∣on
of his drinking after he rose from the grave; and that, as some will
have it, either in reference to his promise to his Disciples,
 
I will not drink
henceforth of this fruit of the Vine untill that day, when I drink it new with you in my
Fathers kingdome.
 Or because (though accepting of meat out of volunta∣ry
conformity) yet he refrained from moisture, to manifest himself,
though no less then a 
true,
 yet much more then a 
meer man:
 but this we
leave with the Authors.


§ 18. Some miles hence towards the north is a mountain of a mo∣derate
ascent and pleasant prospect, generally known by the name of
Christs mountain. Here our 
Saviour
 made that excellent 
Sermon in the
mount,
 which was the key of the 
Old Law.
 And here he chose his twelve
Disciples, frequently repairing hither, when he affected retiredness.
Here also
 learned men on good likelyhood (Scripture being silent of
the particular place) conceive the miracle of loaves multiplied wrought
by our 
Saviour.
 And to avoid confusion, we must carefully observe that
this was twice wrought.

Behold in the latter though the meat was the more, & the mouths few∣er,
yet fewer fragments did remain. And good reason that our 
Saviour
 in
working of miracles, should observe no other proportion then his own
pleasure.



§ 19. Following still the Sea shore and going westward, we light on
the City
 
Cinnereth,
 which some conceive gave the name to the lake ad∣joining,
and also to the land thereabouts. For when 
Benhadad
 in favour
to King 
Asa,
 to remove 
Baasha
 from besieging 
Ramah,
 inroded 
Israel,
 he
smote
 
all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
 Some five miles westward
we meet with 
Bethsaida
 of 
Galilee,
 in English 
a
 
hunting house.
 Nor is it un∣likely,
that at first it was a Mansion meerly made for recreation, the
neighbouring Desert (frequently visited by our 
Saviour
 when desiring
privacy) affording the pleasure of the Game. From a house it grew to
be a village, so called by Saint 
Marke,
 and thence proceeded to be a City
so graced in other
 Gospells. Nor need learned men so trouble them∣selves
about the difference, seeing in a short time 
(Hague
 in 
Holland
 may
be an instance) a great town with addition of walls, may at pleasure
commence a small City. It was the
 native place of 
Peter, Andrew
 & 
Philip,

and another staple City of 
Christs
 miracles, whose ingratitude forced our
Saviours expression, 
Woe unto thee Chorazin, woe unto thee
 Bethsaida &c.


§ 20. In the confines of 
Bethsaida Christ by the hand led forth a blind man
out of the town, spat on his eyes,
 so restoring him to a confused and imper∣fect
sight 
to see men walking as
 trees,
 (well might his spittle give half sight,
whose
 breath gave man whole life at the Creation) and then putting
his hands upon his eyes compleatly cured him. But how came it to pass
that he, who other whiles healed at distance by the Proxie of his word,

Subveniens priùs quàm veniens,
 curing before coming to his Patients, should
here be so long, not to say tedious, in working a miracle? 
Even so Savi∣our,
because it pleased thee.
 Let us not raise cavills where we should rather
return thanks, seeing Christ, that our dull meditations might keep pace
with his actions, did not onely goe slowly on set purpose, but even stay∣ed
in the mid way of a miracle, doing it first by halves, that our con∣ceptions
might the better overtake him.


§ 21. To clear this Corner before we goe hence: north-east of 
Beth∣saida,

on a tridented mountain standeth 
Saphetta,
 two parts whereof are
inhabited by the Turks, and one by the 
Iews,
 and is at this day a very
considerable Place. Here the 
Iews
 live in the greatest liberty (or rather
in the least slavery) of any place under heaven: having some tolerable
Priviledges allowed them by the 
Turk.
 So that they who get wealth
enough elsewhere, here seem to have some shew of a common-wealth.
Yea here there is a
 University of 
Iews.
 And though commonly that
Nation count their children to have learning enough, if able to cheat

Christians
 in their bargains, here they give them studious education: and
the pure 
Hebrew tongue
 (as also at 
Thessalonica,
 now 
Salonichi
 in 
Greece
) is
here usually spoken, but industriously acquired, the 
Iews
 being neithe

born to foot of land nor word of language then what they purchase by
their paines. What shall we say if this little place be left still to 
keep pos∣session,

as an 
earnest
 that God in due time upon their conversion may pos∣sibly
restore the whole countrey unto them?



§ 22. Three Cities follow southwest, 
Naphtali,
 a city properly so called;

Thisbe
 different from the native place of 
Eliah;
 and 
Naasson;
 all their
credits depending on the two first verses of the book of 
Tobit.
 Now as

Comoedians,
 though often they adorn their interludes with fancies and
fictions; yet are very carefull always to lay their scene right, in a true
place, which is eminently and notoriously known: so grant the book
of 
Tobit
 guilty of improbabilities and untruths, surely the author thereof
would be punctuall in describing the place, past possibility of confutati∣on.
Yet since the same book presents us with the pedegree of the An∣gell

Raphael,
 with
 
Ananias the great
 his Father, and
 
Sammajas
 his grand∣father,
contrary to our Saviours character, 
that they neither
 marry, nor are
given in marriage,
 and so by consequence can neither get, nor can be be∣gotten;
we may as justly suspect his Geography, as Genealogy, and
conceive him false in the position of towns, who is fabulous in the ex∣traction
of Angels. And if 
Naphtali
 and 
Thisbe
 pass for reall places, yet
not onely doubtfull, but desperate is the case of the City 
Naasson,
 not
being founded on the rock of the Greek text, where no such town ap∣pears,
but on the quick-sand of the erroneous 
Vulgar Latine
 translation.


§ 23. Having thus surveyed the east and south parts of this Tribe,
lest the other coasts thereof should justly complain of neglect, we re∣turn
to mount 
Libanus
 to give an account of the remainder. In this
Map, though not in this Tribe (no trespass I hope to look over the hedge)
behold 
Heliopolis,
 in English, 
the City of the Sun.
 But how well it brooks
the name, they can best tell,
 who of certain report, that 
the height of the
mountains adjoining shadow it from the Sun the better half of the day.
 Was it there∣fore
by the same figure, 
that the mountains are so called from moving,
 that 
Helio∣polis

got this name? Or because the Sun (as all other Blessings are valued)
is most worshipped, where it is most wanted. Not far hence, the river


Fons hortorum Libani,
 or 
the fountain of the gardens of Libanus,
 (with which
the banks thereof on either side are enamelled) fetcheth his originall;
running thence by 
Hamah,
 afterwards called 
Epiphania,
 often mentioned
in Scripture. Thus far came the twelve
 spies, sent to search the land;
and this place passeth in
 Scripture 
from the entring of Hamah
 for the nor∣thern
Boundary of the land of 
Israel,
 not onely before the expression of

Dan
 came into request, but also long after the
 mention thereof in holy
Writ was disused. We shall in due place speake, as of 
Hamah the great,
 so
named by the
 Prophet, (since called 
Antiochia
 in 
Coelosyria,
 and by vul∣gar
unskilfulness often confounded with this 
Hamah
 in 
Naphtali
) so also
of
 
Ashimah,
 the topicall or peculiar Idoll of this place.


§ 24. Hence that river runneth by 
Hazor,
 anciently the
 Metropolis
of the 
Canaanites,
 where very many of their Kings met together against

Ioshua,
 to his great advantage. Had he sought them in their severall Ci∣ties,
to what expence of time and paines would it have amounted?
Whereas now their malice did his work, all of them meeting together,


having but one neck in effect, which here they tendred to the Axe of di∣vine
justice. 
Hazor
 by 
Ioshua
 was burnt, and more then an hundred
years after was probably reedified by 
Iabin the Second,
 into whose hand
God is said 
to have sold his people.
 Not far off 
this river of Gardens
 leaveth

Naphtali,
 and vis
teth the Tribe of 
Asher.


§ 25. But before we leave the river, let this memorandum be entred,
that
 some hold this is the same with the 
Sabbatariam
 river mentioned in

 
Pliny;
 which is said to run six days, and lie still the seventh, whence it
gained the name. Were this true; as 
Solomon
 sent the sluggard to the


Pismire
 to learn industry, well might profane persons be remitted to
this river, thereby to be instructed in the Sabbaths due observation. But
most listen to it, as to a fable, and the 
Hurlers in Cornwall
 (men
 meta∣morphosed
into stones, as tradition reports, for playing on the Lords
day) may fitly serve to build a bridge over this river. It much shakes the
credit of this report, because
 
Iosephus
 relates it clean contrary, namely
that this river lies still sixe days, and onely runs the seventh: adding how

Titus the Emperour
 going from 
Iury
 to 
Antioch
 took a journey by the way
to behold the same. But indeed learned
 
Casaubon
 not onely observeth
herein the Copies of 
Iosephus
 to be corrupted, but also giveth his advice
for the amendment of the same. So that by right pointing his words,
and some other small alteration, 
Iosephus
 and 
Pliny,
 may be made to a∣gree.
However modern travellers bring us no intelligence of such alter∣nation
or intermitting course of any river hereabouts, and some per∣chance
will be ready to say, that since the Jewish Sabbath hath been
swallowed up in the Christians Lords day, this river hath discontinued
his former custome, lest what anciently was ceremonious, be now adays
censured for superstitious.


§ 26. Let us now traverse this tribe southeast: where we c
not miss 
Abel

a City, sometimes single, sometimes double represented unto us, namely



1
t
.
 
Abel
 of 
Bethmaacah;
 as if the former were but parcell of the latter.


2
ly
.
 
Abel
 and 
Bethmaacah;
 as if different, but bordering Cities.


3
ly
.
 
Abel-Bethmaacah;
 as if both made up one and the same place.




In this City, 
Sheba
 the rebell, pursued by 
Ioab
 and his own guiltiness,
took covert, so that the storme of a furious assault was ready to fall up∣on
it, when the breath of a wise woman blew it cleare away, who so
ordered it, that
 
Sheba's
 head was cast over the wall See how his head,
which thought to turn all 
Israel upside down,
 when whirled in the aire, was
tossed and tumbled about. And pity it is any bullets should be shot in∣to
that city, which would cast such 
fireballs
 out of it. We know the wic∣ked
mans, not the wise womans name, and yet when his vertueless
name shall rot, her nameless vertue shall remain. But 
Abel
 wanted such
another wise woman to protect it, when furiously
 taken by 
Be
hadad,

and at last finally destroied by
 
Tiglath-Pilesar.


§ 27. But in the very midst of this Tribe the
 oake-trees of 
Zahanaim



fair and far spread themselves: For 
Tremellius
 reads it 
Quercetum Zahana∣im,
The oake-tree place of Zahanaim,
 where our translations render it 
the plain
of Zahanaim.
 A difference not so great but that our age can accommodate,
which being wastfull in woods hath expounded into 
plains,
 many places
which formerly were dark with the thickest oake-trees. Here 
Iael
 the
wife of 
Heber the Kenite
 dwelt in her tent, whither 
Sisera
 (who went
forth with nine hundred charets, but was glad to come home on two
legs) fled for security, having quitted his chariot. Not that he thought him∣self
swifter, but safer without it; seeing his chariot which in fight was the
strength to cover, in flight was the mark to discover him. And here 
Iael

w
th
 a hammer & nail dispatched him, for w
ch
 she was blessed by 
Deborah.


§ 28. The mention of her blessing minds us of the curse of 
Meroz,

and consequently to inquire, where the same was seated. Well may we
look for it in any Tribe, which we finde in no Tribe. Yea learned men
doe so differ in their verdict, that some will have 
Meroz
 to be, 1 The De∣vill
himself, as
 
Nicholas Lyra,
 whose opinion is rejected and refuted by
all that mention it. 2 A potent

Person in these parts having many Te∣nants
and Reteiners. 3 A Countrey full of populous inhabitants. 4 A


City near the place where the battell against 
Sisera
 was fought Grant the
last as most probable, new Quaere's are ingendred; whether a City of 
Ca∣ananites

or 
Israelites;
 and where to be placed. For the exact position whereof
we refer the reader to those our learned Divines, which in these unhappy
dissensions have made that
 Text so often the subject of their Sermons.
We have placed it in this tribe not far from 
Kedesh,
 whence 
Barak
 first
went forth with his men, in the place where 
Mercators
 Maps have a
city called 
Meroth
 (a rush-candle is better then no light) our one∣ly
motive for the situation thereof. Mean time consider, that as the Di∣sciples
observed that the figtree cursed by our
 Saviour, was in their re∣turn
withered away; so this city after 
Deborah's
 execration so dwindled
by degrees, that nothing is left of 
Meroz,
 but 
Meroz,
 nothing surviving of
the thing but the name. Which name, let the reader behold in our Map
as the mast of that ship, whose keel is swallowed up in the quicksands.
A Sea-mark to all posterity to beware, and not to be negligent when they
are called to be auxiliaries to Gods cause in distress.


§ 29. And now our hand is in about conjecturall places, we must not
forget 
Madon
 once a roiall city,
 certainly hereabouts, because,
 
Iobab
 the
King thereof, was conquered by 
Ioshua at the waters of Merom,
 though all
our industry cannot discover the particular position thereof. Happy our
condition that in things concerning salvation we have Christs gracious
promise,
 
Seek and ye shall finde,
 though in these meaner maters our search
often wanteth success. We are bold to place it near 
Dan
 one of the foun∣tains
of 
Iordan,
 the rather because
 
Brocard
 findes a place thereabouts cal∣led

Medan
 by the Turks at this day. Where I pray let it stand till better in∣formation,
for rather then with 
Adrichomius
 we should leave it out of our


Maps, it is better to put it under any penthouse, then quite shut it out of
doors. Let 
Dan-javan,
 the third station where 
Ioab
 pitched his tent when he
numbred the people, be joined unto it.


§ 30. To return to the place where 
Meroz
 is set, with far more certainty we
place
 
Harrosheth
 of the 
Gentiles,
 the native City of 
Sisera.
 But if the reader
should chance to overlook the low situation thereof, he cannot oversee

Kedesh Naphtali
 the habitation of
 
Barak,
 and a city of refuge belonging to
the 
Levites;
 for observable it is that all the cities of refuge on this side 
Ior∣dan

were advantaged on very high foundations. And they
 
appointed K
∣desh
in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Sechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjath-ar∣ba
(which is Hebron) in the mountain of Iudah.
 Whether because those
towns were to typifie Christ himself, who like the brazen Serpent 
was to
be listed up,
 or to comfort the flying and fainting offender, whose eyes were
at his journeys end long before his feet, which could not but much re∣vive
his spirits. Say not, that it damped them again when his tyred legs
after a long and tedious journey must at last 
limb up a steep mountain
to the city of refuge: For (as hath been observed

before) if the offender
got but within the verge of the suburbs on either side of the city, he was
secured from the Avenger of bloud.


§ 31. 
Kedesh
 was attended on each side with two smaller cities, 
Beth∣shemesh

on the west, 
Beth-anath
 on the southeast, both assigned to, yet nei∣ther
possessed by the 
Naphtalites,
 because the
 
Canaanites
 though tributaries
dwelt therein. Much is pretended in the excuse of the 
Israelites
 why ge∣nerally
they drove not these heathens out of their Countrey.




1 None can act above their strength, and they were not able to
drive out the 
Canaanites.


2 Had they strength, it had been cruelty, not valour, in cold bloud
to kill quiet enemies.


3 God gave them a kind of toleration being only to drive them
out by degrees.


4 Much good accrued by this remnant of 
Canaanites
 being touch∣stones
to prove the 
Iews
 faith to their God.




But these and many more palliations notwithstanding, unexcusable
was the 
Iews
 connivence at them contrary to Gods flat command, and
the foresaid pleas of no validity. For



1 The weakness of the 
Iews
 chiefly consisted in their want of in∣dustry,
and uniting themselves against those heathen their com∣mon
enemy.


2 It is onely cruelty to a mans own soul to disobey Gods positive
command.


3 What's to be done by degrees, is to be done. Whereas the 
Iews
 not
only reprieved these 
Canaanites
 for a time according to Gods per∣missiō,
but finally pardoned their lives contrary to his injunction.


4 The good accidentally accruing from the remains of the 
Canaa∣nites,



argues not the innocence of the 
Israelites,
 but the exceeding
goodness of God, ordering their negligence to his own honour.



Yea the sad success shewed Gods displeasure with his people herein; these

Canaanites
 eftsoons rouzing themselves from being couchant under tri∣bute
to be rampant in tyranny, and the mixture of their persons infected
the 
Israelites
 with their Idolatrous practises. Nor know I any thing else
considerable in this tribe except
 
Karthan
 or
 
Kiriathaim,
 a city of the 
Levites
Gershonites,
 of whose posture we are not so wel assured as we could desire.


§ 32. 
Ahimaaz
 was 
Solomons
 Purveyer in 
Naphtali,
 and had 
Basmah
 his
daughter to wife. Say not it was poor preferment for the daughter of so
mighty a Monarch to marry her Fathers subject. For Gods law forbad,
heathen matches, and hereby she might keep a clear conscience and lead a
comfortable life. Kings children too often wed where they neither affect
nor are affected, to forain Princes (strangers as well in their lands as loves
unto them) whilst here 
Solomons
 daughter, might have a softer Pillow,
though not so sumptuous curtains in her home-marriage. By the way ob∣serve,
we finde an army of 
Solomons
 wives and concubines, and but three
scattered scouts of his children,
 a son and two daughters. Multiplying
wives in mans sin, children, Gods blessing, and 
Solomon
 laid too many
foundations at once, to build much posterity upon them.


§ 33. The usuall Armes of 
Naphtali
 are Vert a Hinde trippant proper ac∣cording
to
 
Iacobs
 prediction: 
Naphtali is a Hinde let loose; he giveth goodly
words.
 But how this character conformes to the Tribe, learned men much
disagree;
 
Luther
 findes the analogy in 
Deborah,
 where in deed both her fe∣minine
sex is proper, as also because she was an excellent
 spokeswoman;
all the error is, she was rather extracted from


Ephraim
 then 
Naphtali.


§ 34. Others reade the resemblance in 
Barak,
 because Hindelike he was
so fearful to come out to war. But surely these blessings were givē by pro∣phetical

Iacob
 to his children as future badges of their honour, not brands
of their infamy, and therefore the similitude is to be sought not in the
disgracefull but commendable qualities of a Hinde, and more probably
to be fetch'd not from their fear but fleetness in severall performances.
Besides some conceive it too restrictive an interpretation of 
Iacobs
 bles∣sing
to confine it to any particular (though eminent) person, which
speakes rather the generall disposition of the whole Tribe, and may thus
more largely be expounded 
Naphtali is a Hinde.
 No ravenous or beast of
prey (cruell like the 
Benjamites,
 churlish like the 
Ephraimites
) but a quiet
creature: intimating the 
Naphtalites
 nature disposed to peacefulness. 
Let
loose.
 Not pent within the pales of a Park, but having room enough to
range in: implying the large and spacious possessions of this Tribe. 
He gi∣veth
goodly words.
 They were men of fair speech and loving discourse, not
querulous, nor captious, but preferring friendly compliance before
brawles & contentions. The Standard of 
Naphtali
 in the 
Israelites
 pitching
about the Tabernacle, was the last in the Reare on the northside thereof.






Here the Map of 
Asher
 is to be inserted.













THE TRIBE OF ASHER. CHAP. 5.


§ 1. 
A
Sher
 youngest Son of 
Iacob
 by 
Zilpah
 his Concubine,
carrieth blessedness in his name, and was so prospe∣red
in his posterity, that
 forty one thousand and
five hundred were reckoned of this Tribe in the
generall rendezvous at mount 
Sinah.
 All which
punished in the wilderness with death, for provo∣king
God with their disobedience, their sons being
 fifty three thousand
four hundred entred the land of promise. Many no doubt were the emi∣nent

Grandees
 extracted from 
Asher,
 though we mee
 with none of them
in Scripture, save one, and that a woman in the new Testament,
 
Anna

the Prophetess, that property of the Temple, as constant therein as the
pillars thereof, 
she departed not thence but served God with fasting and prayer
night and day.


§ 2. 
Asher
 had mount 
Libanus
 on the north, 
Naphtali
 on the east, 
Ze∣bulun

on the south and southeast, the sea on the west containing welnigh
forty miles in length, the breadth not exceeding sixteen. A fruitfull coun∣trey,

 
Ashers bread shall be fat
 (so hearty as if it were bread and flesh too)

and he shall yeeld royall dainties. Moses
 foretold that he should be wetshooed
in oile, 
he should dip his
 foot therein.
 Adding moreover that his 
shooes should
be iron and brasse.
 Not that the ground in this Tribe parched by drought
proved impenetrable, and rebellious to the commands of the plough,
(as elsewhere God threatens the disobedient 
Iews,
 the earth that is under
thee shall be iron
) but that this land should afford plenty of those metalls,
according to the testimony of 
Eumaeus
 in
 
Homer,




In Sidon I 
oast to be born where's brasse in aboundance.


Besides the great commodities of the sea, with the convenient havens
thereof, 
Debora
 complains that when 
Zebulun
 and 
Naphtali
 (most con∣cerned
as nearest danger) ingaged themselves against 
Sisera,
 Asher con∣tinued
on the Seashore, and abode in his breaches.
 And no wonder if being Mer∣chants


they preferred profit before perill, especially being in a safe place
where the iron chariots of 
Iabin
 King of 
Canaan
 could not approach them.


§ 3. The worst mischief in this Tribe was, that after the death of

Ioshua,
 the 
Canaanites
 quartered so hard on the men of 
Asher,
 that they
detained no fewer then seven
 great cities from them. Yea perchance
something may be pickt out of the expression of the holy Spirit, for
whereas the 
Canaanites
 are said to 
dwell amongst those of
 Zebulun,
 the 
Asherites

(the phrase being altered) in the following verse are said to 
dwell among the
Canaanites,
 as if those pagans were the principall Land-lords (ingrossing
all memorable places in this Tribe to themselves) whilest the 
Asherites

lived amongst them as Tenants at will by the others leave. Nor was
this fully remedied untill the victorious reigns of 
David
 and 
Solomon.


§ 4. In the north-west part of this Tribe neer the sea side,
 we first
meet with
 
Misrepothmaim,
 that is, the boyling of waters, though uncer∣tain
whether done artificially by fire, or naturally by the Sun. Here great
plenty of salt was made in brine-pits, a necessary, and gainfull commo∣ditie.
However, 
Tremellius
 rendreth 
Misrepothmaim fornaces vitrarias,
Glass-furnaces;
 and we know, store of the
 best sort of that brickle ware
was made hereabouts. 
Ioshua
 having foiled the Kings of 
Canaan
 at the
waters of 
Merom,
 pursued them thus far to the shore of the Mediterrane∣an,
where his foes had the free choise, whether they would be killed with
the sword, or drowned in the sea. Hard by is 
Mearah,
 which signifieth 
a
cave,
 (and so some translations render it, though others retain the He∣brew
word) being the
 northern boundary of the land of 
Canaan,
 and
an impregnable underground fortification of the 
Zidonians.
 Yea many
hundred years after in the Holy War, when the Christians possessed

Palestine,
 they manfully defended it untill the garison therein
 corrupted
with money, basely betrayed it unto the 
Saracens.


§ 5. Observe by the way,
 that the hills in 
Palestine
 generally had in their
sides plenty of caves, and those of such laxity and receit, that ours in

England
 are but conny-boroughs if compared to the palaces which
those hollow places afforded. Neither wonder that the cave of 
Makkedah

could contain five
 Kings together, or that 
Obadiah
 could hide an hun∣dred
Prophets by fifty & fifty in a
 cave, or that about four hundred men
abode with 
David
 in the cave of
 
Adullam,
 or that six hundred 
Benjamites

lurk't, for four moneths, in the 
rock of
 Rimmon,
 when
 
Strabo
 hath repor∣ted,

that towards Iturea,
 (which beginneth not far off) 
there be sharp moun∣tains,
having deep de
s in them, whereof one is able to receive four thousand Men.

These caves (being only a cellar by nature) were by Art contrived into
severall rooms, and by industry fortified even unto admiration. So well
man'd, they could not be stormed, well victualled, they could not be
starved, and (not having any combustible matter about them) fire-free
they could not be burned, so thick, they could not be battered, so high,
they could not be scaled, and so low, they could not be undermined.


But these Inns gave entertainment to any guests, and as sometimes they
gave shelter to pious people in persecution, so often they afforded har∣bour
to theeves and vagabonds. The Psalmist glanceth on such places,
in that his expression, 
Thou art of more honour and
 might then the hills of the
robbers;
 and our Saviour directly pointeth at them, when he complain∣eth,
that they had turned the house of God into 
a
 den of theeves.


§ 6. To proceed,
 hereabouts we can quickly discover an ancient City,
wrongfully placed by the presumption of Authors, namely 
Enoch,

built by 
Cain
 in the land of 
Nod,
 which
 one tells us was at the
foot of mount 
Libanus,
 and that vast foundations thereof are at this day
to be seen. Surely 
Cains
 wandring humour (bloudy hands are al∣ways
attended with roving feet) seems to have possessed these Authors
brains, stragling in the position of this place so far from the truth, and
the text, which describeth it east of
 
Eden.
 But we may seek the City

Enoch
 with more probability to finde it amongst the 
Henochii,
 a people
seated by
 
Pliny
 neer the 
Bactrians
 in the east country.


§ 7. But before we goe farther, we will alter our former method,
(hoping such variety will prove the more pleasant) and because most
memorable Places in 
Asher,
 are mentioned in 
Ioshua,
 where the Posses∣sions
of this Tribe were first allotted him; we will briefly comment on
those verses, wherein the Bounds of his Inheritance are described.


Ioshua 19. 24.
 And the fifth lot came out for the Tribe of the Children of
Asher according to their Families.


To prevent all Quarrels, the Land on this side 
Iordan
 was divided by
lot, betwixt the nine Tribes and an half, much of providence being cou∣ched
under the seeming casualty thereof; for although their Portions
fell not to them in such 
seniority
 as they sate down at 
Pharaoh
's
 
Table, the
first-born according to his Birth-right, and the youngest according to his youth,
 yet
an excellent method was observed therein: For,



The first
 Lot fell to 
Iudah
 the 
Tribe Royall,
 of whom the
 
Chief Ru∣lers

and Christ himself was to descend.


The
 second, to the sons of 
Ioseph, Ephraim
 and 
Manasses,
 to whom
(on 
Reubens
 forfeiting thereof) the Birth-right belonged.


The third to
 
Benjamin, Iacobs
 youngest, but next best beloved son,
by 
Rachel
 his dearest wife.


The fourth, fifth and sixth for 
Simeon
 Zebulun
 and 
Issachar,
 his sons
by 
Leah,
 so that all 
Iacobs
 children by his wives were provided for
first, before those he had by his Concubines received any Pos∣sessions.


The seventh for 
Asher
 Iacobs
 son by
 
Zilpah
 handmaid to 
Leah
 his
first wife, and therefore her child in seniority preferred, 
Gad
 his
elder brother being already provided for on the other side 
Iordan.


The eight and ninth for 
Naphtali
 and
 
Dan
 born of 
Bilhah
 hand∣maid
to 
Rachel,
 the younger sister, and 
Iacobs
 second wife.




We know who said in another case,
 
I sleep, but my heart awaketh.
 So see
here, though drowzie 
Chance
 in the Lot is commonly challenged to have
slept out her eyes, and to become stark blind, yet is there a concealed vigi∣lancy
therein, ordered by divine Providence.


Verse 25.
 And their border was Helkah, and Hali, and Beten, and Ach∣shaph.


In expounding these words for the maine we follow learned 
Masius,

though loth to erre with any, willing to venture sooner on his then any
other Authors judgement herein. May the Reader find out 
Helkah
 in
our Mappe (in the South-east part thereof, not farre from the Sea) thence
let his eies start, and with good successe (following the names in the
Text, and the pricks in our Mappe for his direction) surround the Bor∣ders
of this Tribe. 
Helkah
 was afterwards given to the 
Levites Gershonites,

to be one of their
 foure Cities in this Tribe, had 
Achshaph
 and formerly
been a Royall City of the 
Canaanites
 whose King had been conquered
by 
Ioshua
.


Verse 26.
 And Alamelech, and Amad, and Mishael, and reacheth to Carmel
Westward, and Shihor Libnah.


Mishael
 or
 
Mashal
 was another City of the 
Levites.
 By this the Bor∣der
of 
Asher
 ran Southwestward to 
Carmell;
 understand thereby not the
mountain so called (lying more South in 
Zebulun
) but the Plain lying
under the same, more towards the North. 
Shihor Libnah,
 that is, the 
white
 
River.
 Now for streames to take their names from their colours, is no
news to them that have heard of 
Albis
 in 
Germany, Melas
 in 
Thracia,
 and
two Rivers called 
Blackwater,
 the one in the South, the other in the North
of 
Ireland.
 But whether this River in 
Asher
 took the whitenesse from the
foaming water therein, or Chalk-banks (like our 
Albion
) on both sides,
or from the materials of glasse or crystall growing there, let others dis∣pute,
whilst we onely observe that 
Album Promontorium
 or the 
white Pro∣montory,

is by
 
Pliny
 placed hereabouts.


Verse 27.
 And turneth toward the Sun rising to Beth Dagon, and reacheth
to Zebulun, and to the Valley of Iiphthabel toward the Northside of Beth∣emek,
and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand.


The Map will make all these flexures plain. 
Beth Dagon,
 that is, the
Temple of 
Dagon;
 but how came this
 Idol of the 
Philistims
 to travell thus
farre almost to 
Phoenicia?
 Surely it never came hither on its own legges,
as the
 Psalmist observes, 
Feet have they, but they walk not,
 but was brought
by the Superstition of the 
Canaanites,
 which borrowed this Idol
from their neighbours. Concerning 
Cabul, quaere
 whether it were the
name of a particular place, or the same with the 
Land of Cabul,
 which I
conceive lay more Northward, which
 
Solomon
 afterward bestowed on

Hiram
 King of 
Tyre.


Verse 28.
 And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto
great Zidon.


Hebron
 differing from a greater City of the same name in the Tribe of

Iudah. Rehob,
 that is, 
large
 or 
spacious,
 this name speaking it a City of great
receipt. Unto this
 place came the twelve Spies sent to discover the Land,
and this City was afterwards bestowed upon the
 Levites. This 
Kanah

the great is conceived by some the birth place of 
Simon
 the
 
Canaa∣nite,

the disciple of Christ. Great 
Zidon
 was given to, never gained by
this Tribe, whose Borders reached to 
Zidon
 exclusively, so that 
Ashers

lips might touch the cup, but not taste the liquor of so sweet a City.


Verse 29.
 And then the Coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong City
Tyre, aud the Coast turneth to Hosah, and the outgoings thereof are at the
Sea from the coast to Achzib.


Turneth,
 namely towards the South; 
Rama
,
 that is, an high place, as
the name importeth, therefore seated by us on a Mountain; Such Maps
as place 
Ramah
 in a valley are guilty of as great a Solecisme in Geography,
as he in gesture, who speaking, 
O Heavens,
 pointed to 
the Earth.
 Wonder
not that in 
Palestine
 we meet with so many 
Ramahs
 (Towns seated on a
rising or advantage of ground) seeing it was so mountainous a Coun∣trey:
Equivalent whereunto we have the frequent name of 
Upton
 in 
Eng∣land,

whereof I have told, (Smile good Reader, but doe not jeer at my
curiosity herein) no fewer then three and thirty in the Alphabeticall
names of 
Speeds
 descriptions. 
Tyre
 like 
Zidon
 was never possest by the

Asherites,
 neither was 
Achzib
 neer to 
Helkah
 where we first began our
preambulation about this Tribe, and now 
redit labor actus in orbem,
 we
have 
walked the Round,
 and encompassed the Bounds thereof.


Verse 30.
 Ummah also and Aphek, and Rehob, twenty and two Cities with
their Villages. This is the inheritance of the Tribe of the children of Asher,
according to their families, these Cities with their Villages.


All the former were limitary places in the Tribe of 
Asher,
 these three
last were more Inland Cities in the heart of the Countrey. To avoid tau∣tology,

ehob
 here, must be allowed a distinct City from that mentio∣ned
before.


§ 8. But of all these Cities, 
Aphek
 was most remarkable, whose King

 was killed by 
Ioshua,
 and neer whereunto 
Benhadad
 (lately beaten by 
A∣hab

on the Mountains of 
Samaria
) with his new model'd Army in a new
place hoped for new successe. For in stead of the thirty two
 Kings, of
more pomp then puissance to his Army, he placed so many Captaines,
seeing it is not the shining of the hilt, but the sharpnesse of the edge of
the sword must do the the deed. And resolved to fight in the Plain, con∣ceiving
the Gods of the 
Israelites
 (though by 
Benhadads
 swelling words &
lofty
 language one might rather have collected the 
Syrian
 Gods to have
been) 
the Gods of the Moūtains.
 Then appeared he with a mighty Host, against
whom the 
Israelites
 marched forth like 
two little flocks of
 
Kids.
 Behold here


a wonder, the Kids kill the Wolves, and a hundred thousand 
Syrian
 foot∣men
were kill'd in one day. From the field they flie into the City of 
A∣phek.

What, was it to try whether the God of 
Israel
 (concluded now God
of the Countrey, be it hilly or plain) were God of the City also? They
found it so by sad experience, when the wall of the City fell on twenty
and seven
 thousand of them that were left, which wall if cruell to kill,
was charitable to bury them.


§ 9. Yet 
Ahab
 afterwards lost the advantage of this victory, when con∣trary
to Gods flat command, on 
Benhadads
 feigned submission he indul∣ged
life unto him, which caused his own death
 and destruction not long
after. Thus foolish pity, in stead of breaking, whets the knife for it's
own throat: and they who onely take out the teeth and sting of such ser∣pents
which they should kill outright, shall finde the very stumps and
tail remaining enough to bite and sting them to death.


§ 10. 
Baanah
 the sonne of 
Hushai
 was 
Solomons
 purveyor in 
Asher and
in
 Aloth;
 What this 
Aloth
 should be, a deep silence is in all Comments. I
conceive it a hilly Countrey, appendent to 
Asher,
 ascending with moun∣tains,
according to the notation of the Hebrew word. Herein our guesse
is seconded by plenty of
 
Gradati montes, Staired mountains,
 which goe up by
degrees, found in these parts, and one most eminent, whereof
 
Iosephus

takes especiall notice, being an hundred furlongs north of 
Ptolemais,
 cal∣led

scala Tyriorum,
 or the 
Tyrians Ladder.
 How neer our conjecture is bow∣led
to the mark I know not, but hope the Reader before he knocks this
away will lay a better in the room thereof. So much of 
Asher,
 whose
countrey was much straitned by the 
Phoenicians,
 their mortall enemies
(lying within his bounds, though never subdued) which we now come
to describe.


§ 11. 
Phoenicia
 is often mentioned
 in Scripture, and is so called as
some will have it 
, from plenty of palm trees growing
therein; as others 
 from the many slaughters formerly made
in that warlike Nation. To omit other antiquated deductions thereof,
prettiest (because newest) is that of a modern
 Author from 
 
bhene-Anak,
Pheanak, Phoenik, the sons of Anak,
 as the fathers and founders of the
people of this Country. A long slender Country it is, having the bounds
thereof by severall Authors variously assigned; but generally extended
from the Sea to Mount 
Libanus
 in breadth, and in length from 
Carmel
 to
the River 
Canis
 in the north; a tract of an hundred miles and upwards.


§ 12. The inhabitants hereof were transcendently ingenious; whose
wits (like the gold wire they so much dealt with) were ductile and
pliable to all inventions. From a pin to a pillar, nothing was so small
but their skill could work, nothing so great but their industry could at∣chieve.
Whatsoever was pretty for children to play with, or neat for
women to weare, or necessary for man to use, in any one of these the

Phoenicians
 were so expert, nature might seem to design them for that


alone, and so dextrous in all of them, it were hard to say wherein they
excelled. They could weave clothes with the smallest thred, dresse them
with the finest work, dye them with the freshest colours, embroider
them with the richest cost, and then either sell them to others to their
great profit, or weare them with as much pride themselves. They were
excellent Architects; 
Solomon
 himself (who well knew the most cunning
workmen in every craft) confessing to 
Hiram,
 There is not amongst us
any that can skill to he
 timber like the Sidonians.
 They are also conceived
the first founders of Letters, Arithmetick, Astronomy, with the wor∣king
in glasse, and severall other rare devices.


§ 13. 
Tyre
 was the chiefest city in 
Phoenicia,
 situate at the entrance of the
Sea.
 Elegantly the
 Prophet termeth 
the harvest of the river her revenue:
 an
harvest lasting all the yeare long, every day sowing at the setting forth,
and reaping at the return of her Ships. 
Tyre
 said of her self,
 
I am of perfect
beauty,
 which coming out of her own mouth was rather proudly then
falsly spoken. If it be accounted one of the stateliest sights in the world,
to see a stout Ship under saile, how beautifull was it to behold the 
Tyrian

Gallies with all their accoutrements; Planks of
 the Fir-trees of 
Senir,

Masts of the Cedars of 
Lebanon,
 Oares of the Oaks of 
Bashan,
 Hatches of
the ivory of 
Chittim,
 Sailes with broidered work (oh vanity top and top
gallant!) out of 
Egypt,
 blue and purple Carpets for covering from the
Iles of 
Elisha,
 with 
Giblites
 for Calkers, 
Arvadites
 for Mariners, 
Persians

&c. for Souldiers, and 
Tyrians,
 her own Townsmen for 
Pilots,
 so keep∣ing
the honour, and haply seeking to preserve the mysteries of their har∣bour
to themselves?


§ 14. Passe we from their Ships to their Shops, which we finde
fraught with commodities of all kindes. Whose
 
Merchants are Princes,

saith the Prophet; and it seems that 
Tyramus
 a good word for a good
King (till customary using thereof in the worst sense infected it) had its
originall from the Pride and Magnificence of the 
Tyrian
 Merchants. This
city is termed
 
a Mart of Nations,
 both because all Nations were there to
sell, and there to be sold:
 
they traded the persons of men,
 and not onely
armes but armies, were here to be bought, and
 
horsemen as well as horses

were chaffered in their markets.


§ 15. Now as 
Tyre
 was dispersed all over the world in the severall Colo∣nies
planted by her in forein parts; so the World was contracted into

Tyre,
 whither Merchants from all countries did repair. Compare 
Ezek.

27. with 
Gen.
 10. and it will appear, that most of those nations which
departed from 
Babel
 in a confusion, met in 
Tyre
 in such a method as now
inabled through industry, observation, and entercourse, they could un∣derstand
the languages and traffique one with another. We intend a little
to insist both upon the commodities and countries of such as hither re∣sorted.
For though I dare not goe out of the bounds of 
Canaan
 to give
these Nations a visit at their own homes, yet finding them here within


my Precincts, it were incivility in me not to take some acquaintance of
them. In setting down of their severall places, I have wholly followed
(let my candle goe out in a stink, when I refuse to confess from whom
I have lighted it) 
Bochartus
 in his 
holy Geography.
 Their severall trades
we rank according to the 
twelve great Companies
 in 
London.
 Let not the
comparison as ominous offend any, 
Tyre
 since being reduced to a rui∣nous
heap; seeing the Parallel is onely intended to shew the like latitude
of commerce betwixt them. However, it is neither unseasonable on this
occasion, nor improper for my profession (every 
Minister
 in this respect
being the Cities 
Remembrancer
) to minde 
London
 not to trust in uncertain
riches;
 seeing pride and unthankfulness may quickly levell the highest
bank of wealth, yea strongest mountain of outward greatness.




1 Merchant-Mercers.


Such as traded in Silkes 
(Byssus
 in latine, though rendred 
fine-linnen

in our translation) blue and purple, being
 
Egyptians,
 
Syrians,
 and
from the Isles
 of 
Elisha.
 By 
Elisha
 understand 
Peloponnesus,
 wherein an
ancient & ample countrey called 
Elis,
 and part thereof termed 
Alisium
 by

Homer,
 where the adjacent Islands 
Co, Carpathus, Cythera, Rhodes, Gyarus &c.

are eminent for plenty of purple. Here some wil object it was a real tau∣tology
to bring purples to 
Tyre,
 seeing by generall confession the best of
the world were made in that place. In answer whereunto, know that
these 
Elishian
 purples being of a different die and dress from those of 
Tyre,

were a distinct commodity. It is so far from being needless pains, that
it may bring considerable Profit, to carry 
Char-coals
 to 
New-castle.
 And
these courser purples, though not for the 
Tyrians
 own wearing, might be
for their barter with other Nations. Not to say, but that the peevish
principle might possess the people of 
Tyre,
 to slight homebred, and prize
forein wares, so that the 
Tyrians
 Ladies might prefer those purples best
for their own use, which were fetched the farthest off.






2 Merchant-Grocers.


Such as traffiqued
 
with the chief of all spices
 being those of 
Sheba,
 and

Raamah,
 both being places in 
Arabia the happy.
 Great no doubt was the
fragrancy of these spices brought over land to 
Tyre,
 whereas such as are
conveyed into 
England
 by ship from 
India,
 have the less vigour of that
land where they grow, and the more moisture of the sea through which
they are brought. The men also of 
Dan
 and 
Iavan
 (of whom hereafter)
furnished 
Tyre
 with
 
Cassia
 and 
Calamus,
 drugges of high worth and
value.






3 Merchant-Drapers.


Such as brought
 
precious clothes for
 (or 
with) chariots
 being the men
of 
Dedan,
 which is an eminent countrey in 
Idumea.






4 Merchant-Fishmongers.


Many of these must be presumed in 
Tyre,
 where fish was a staple
commodity, which they transported into other countreys, and vented


for their own gain without any other respect of time or place. This
caused 
Nehemiah's
 complaint that in 
Ierusalem
 there dwelt men of 
Tyre

which brought
 
fish
 and all manner of ware, and sold them on the

Sabbath.






5 Merchant-Gold-smiths.


Such as occupied in her Fairs
 
with all precious stones
 out of the Coun∣trey
of 
Sheba
 and 
Raamah
 aforesaid. Besides
 
Emeralds, Corals
 and 
Agate

brought out of 
Syria, Silver
 from 
Tarshish.
 i. e. 
Spaine
 (as our
 Authour
irrefragably proves plenty of that metall therein) and
 
gold
 from 
Ara∣bia.

Yea, as some observe that though the body of the Sun ariseth in the
East, yet his shining by reflexion is first discovered in the
 west, so gran∣ting
gold originally to grow in lands east from 
Tyre,
 yet in this City
most gorgeous and glittering was the lustre thereof, beaten and drawn
out in most artificiall embroideries and embosments.






6 Merchant-Skinners.


Although no mention of their trade in this City, where the heat of
the climate made furs not onely useless but burdensome, yet we may be
confident there wanted not those therein which traded in such skins
which were in valuation in these parts.






7 Merchant-Taylours.


Such as dealt 
in
 all sorts of things, in blew clothes and broidered work, and in
Chests of rich apparell bound with cords and made of Cedar.
 Those that traffiqued
in these commodities were
 of 
Haran
 and 
Canneh
 and 
Eden
 and 
Sheba,
Ashur
 and 
Chilmad,
 all near one another (as appeares by their bundling
up together) about the confluence of 
Tygris
 and 
Euphrates.






8 Merchant-Haberdashers.


Great their number who by whole
sale sold 
he fine manufactures
wrought here, of 
Gold, Silver,
 Ivory
 and 
Ebony,
 brought from 
Dedan
 (diffe∣rent
from the former countrey of the same name in 
Idumea
) at this day cal∣led

Daden,
 situate on the Persian gulf. But oh the infinite varieties of preci∣ous
toyes made thereof! Well did
 
Homer
 give the 
Sidonians
 the Epithet of

, or 
very much ingenious.
 Their fingers might seem all of
bone, so strong and hardy to endure any labour; and yet all of flesh,
so flexible and limber to any imployment. Those mysteries in manu∣factures
which English men in our age gaze on as rare discoveries,
the 
Phenicians
 of 
Tyre
 would but smile at as rude recoveries of what by
them was most perfectly performed.






9 Merchant-Salters.


Store of these may be concluded therein, not onely because salt
is so needfull a commodity, but also because at
 
Misrepothmaim
 or 
the
boyling of waters,
 hard by 
Sidon,
 great store of salt was made.






10 Merchant-Iron-mongers.


Such as bartered
 
in Iron, Tin,
 or 
Lead
 Brought from 
Spaine
 or 
Tarshish,

as also in
 
vessels of brass from Iavan, Tuball
 and 
Mesech,
 that is, 
Ionia, Pontus



and 
Moscovia,
 as our
 Authour will have it, though we are not at leasure
severally to examine his judgment therein.






11 Merchant-Vintners.


Such as traded in
 
Wine of Helbon
 (no doubt most delicious to the
Palate) brought hither by the Merchants of 
Damascus. Helbon
 we con∣ceive
the same with 
Calybon
 a City in 
Syria
 whereof mention in 
Ptolemy,

and from which the Countrey about it is denominated 
Calybonidis.






12 Merchant-Clothworkers.


Such as from the 
Whitewooll
 brought from 
Damascus
 transmitted the
same from the Spinsters wheel, to the Weavers loom, to the Fullers
sheares, to the Dyers vat, and so to be worn by the greatest Princes
in the world, who were beholding to 
Tyre
 the center of rich clothing,
for all their holy-day apparell. Thus was their City fraught with com∣modities
of all kinds, to say nothing of their 
Smithfield
 full of
 
horses,
horsemen
 and 
mules
 from 
Togarma,
 or 
Cappadocia;
 their 
East-cheap
 full
of the flesh of
 
Rams, Lambs, Goats, &c.
 from 
Arabia:
 their 
Leaden-hall

where a market was kept with the wheat of
 
Minnith,
 and 
Pannag

out of 
Iudea,
 so that all things save piety, humility, and thankfulness
to God, were to be had in this City.


§ 16. Thus sate 
Tyre
 on her throne in a Princely posture, no less
envious then proud: witness her rejoycing at the destruction of

Ierusalem
 (the breaking of one Merchant is the making of another)
when she said to her self,
 
Ierusalem is turned unto me, I shall be repleni∣shed
now she is made waste;
 meaning that all trading divided before,
should now be engrossed to her self alone. But God marred her mar∣kets,
threatning by 
Isaiah to
 stain the pride of her glory,
 alluding to 
Tyres

master-piece which was to fixe faire and fresh colours, which
God would soil and blur, notwithstanding all her curiosity in that
kinde. 
Ezekiel
 useth two maritime expressions as most proper for a
Port; first that her enemies should come up against her as 
the Sea
causeth his
 waves to come up,
 and then 
that an east winde should break her,

meaning 
Nebuchadnezzar
 (living north-east from this place) who af∣terwards
besieged and sacked the City.


§ 17. It seems the taking thereof, called elswhere the strong City

Tyre
 did not quit cost for the taking thereof, the profit recei∣ved
by it not countervailing the pains expended upon it; God himself
confesseth that 
Nebuchadnezzar served a great service against Tyre and yet
had
 no wages.
 One tells us that the 
Tyrians
 after thirteen years siege, de∣spoiled
of all hope of relief, abandoned their City, and in their ships
transported their wives, children, and portable wealth to 
Carthage, Cy∣prus,

and other Colonies, leaving 
Nebuchadnezzar
 their empty nest, when
all the birds worth pluming, were flown away. However God after∣wards
gave him 
the spoile of the
 land of Egypt for wages for his army.
 Thus,
not onely those who doe Gods will in a 
direct line,
 but also such, who


collaterally (not to say casually) work his pleasure shall finde a reward,
seeing in sacking of 
Tyre, Nebuchadnezzar
 went in the path and pace of
his own pride and covetousness, though haply in his own way he
met with Gods will, not onely besides his intention, but without the
knowledge thereof.


§ 18. As the ruines, so the
 restauration of 
Tyre
 was foretold by the
Prophet; not the same numericall 
Tyre
 in place and position (for 
Pale∣tyrus

or 
old Tyre
 ever after remained desolate according to the prediction,

 
thou shalt be built no more
) but the same in name, countrey, convenience
of site, wealth, and wickedness. Yea, she exchanged and improved
her place for commodity and strength, removing from the entrance
to the midst of the Sea, from the continent to almost an Island. Here to
use the Prophets expression,
 after seventy years (the end of the 
Babylo∣nish

kingdome) 
Tyre
 began to sing as an harlot; Siren songs to allure
Merchants to be her lovers, as before; counting trade and profit t
 be
her richest pleasure. And so she did flourish againe as much or more
then ever, during the 
Persian
 Monarchy, about two hundred six years; till

Alexander
 the great made her change her tune, alter her notes, and turn
her merry love songs into mournfull Elegies on her selfe. For being
denied by the 
Tyrians
 in their City to sacrifice to 
Hercules
 the Tutelar God
of that place, 
Alexander
 not so superstitious as ambitious, with vast pains
and expence (as one whom no perill could affright, nor labour weary)
sacked the City, putting such to the sword as resisted, and causing two
thousand moe to be hung up in rank on the sea shore. At which time
he built a Castle of his own name (now corruptly called 
Sandalium
)
two miles south of the City.


§ 19. Yet 
Tyre
 afterwards recovered it self to considerable greatness,
like a cunning Broaker, though often proving quite bankrupt, she set up
again, though having nothing to give her credit but the conveniency
of her situation: as indeed an harlot needs no other wares then her self
to set up her trading. Insomuch that the Poets fiction of the 
Phoenix

springing again out of his own ashes, being disclaimed by naturall
History for a falshood, may mythologically finde a truth in, and proba∣bly
fetch its ground from this 
Phoenix
 or 
Phoenician
 City of 
Tyre,
 always
arising fresh and fair out of his own ruines. In our Saviours time it
was a stately place, and yet though with 
Dives
 it was
 
clothed in purple;
Tyre
 could not with him 
fare deliciously every day,
 unless beholding to

Herods
 land of 
Galilee
 to afford it constant provision, 
because its countrey
was
 nourished by the Kings Countrey.
 Sensible hereof when 
Herod
 was high∣ly
displeased with these of 
Tyre
 and 
Sidon,
 they politickly compounded
the breach (knowing that to fight with him who fed them, was the
ready way to be famished) and opening the breast of 
Blastus
 the Kings
Chamberlain with a golden key, through that passage they made their
access to pacifie King 
Herod.



§ 20.
 
Tyre
 at this day is reduced almost to nothing. Here it is season∣ably
remembred that 
Ethbaal
 Father of 
Iezebel
 was the King, as 
Tyre
 was
the chief City of the 
Sidonians,
 and I finde a great conformity betwixt
the fortunes of his daughter and this place:


In their



1 Outward happiness. She a crowned Queen, and 
Tyre
 a


Crowning City,
 whose Merchants were Princes.


2 Inward wickedness; both of them styled
 Harlots in Scri∣pture.


3 Finall wofulness; she eaten up by the dogs to the short re∣version
of her
 
skull, feet
 and 
palmes;
 and 
Tyre
 so consumed by
all-devouring time, 
that now no other then an heap of Ruines, yet
have they a reverent respect,
 and doe instruct the pensive be∣holders
with their exemplary frailty.




Enough of 
Tyre,
 if not too much: fearing that long since the Rea∣der
hath sadly sympathized with the sufferings of 
Nebuchadnezzar
 and

Alexander,
 guessing their pains to be great in the long siege of this place
by the proportion of their own patience in reading our tedious descripti∣on
thereof. All I will adde is this, that though 
Tyre
 was a sink of sin, yet is
this
 recorded in excuse of her profaneness, and mitigation of her
punishment, that if 
the miracles done in Chorazin and Bethsaida
 had been done
in 
Tyre
 and 
Sidon,
 they would have long since repented in sackcloth and
ashes.


§ 21. Two bowes shoot from the east gate of 
Tyre
 the place is
showen, where the woman made that spirituall-carnall exclamation,

 
Blessed is the wombe that bare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck;
 when

Christ
 not disproving her words diverted his Auditours from this, and
directed them to a more necessary trut
, 
Yea rather blessed are they that hear
the word of God and keep it.
 A little mile south of old 
Tyre
 are
 four fair pits,
the least twenty five cubits square, commonly called 
Solomons Cisterns.

Surely the water of them is more clear then is the place alledged out of the

 
Canticles,
 to prove 
Solomon
 the Authour thereof, where but obscure and
oblite mention is made of those water-works. More probable some
King of 
Tyre
 made these and the neighbouring Aqueducts, for the use
of the City.


§ 22. Seventeen miles north of 
Tyre
 lay the City of 
Sidon,
 so named from
the eldest
 son of 
Canaan.
 A city of great antiquity, seeing 
Tyre
 is termed
by the
 Prophet, 
the daughter of Sidon.
 Sure here the Hebrew proverb
held true,
 
As is the mother, so is the daughter,
 both of these Cities being of
great wealth and wickedness. Insomuch that to live 
carelesse, quiet,
 and

secure,
 is in Scripture phrase
 
to live after the manner of the Zidonians.


§ 23. It was also a place of very great extent, therefore termed in

 holy writ, 
Zidon Rabbah,
 or 
great Zidon.
 Not that there was ever a

lesser Zidon,
 (though there be one 
grand Cairo,
 it followeth not there is
also a 
pety Cairo
) but it is emphatically so named in comparison of other


Cities. Yea
 
Diodorus Siculus
 and
 
Pomponius Mela
 make 
Sidon
 the grea∣test
city of all 
Phenicia;
 understand then anciently, whilest as yet she
suckled 
Tyre,
 her little infant, which afterwards outgrew her mother in
greatness. This haply is the reason why 
Homer
 so often making hono∣rable
mention of 
Sidon,
 is so silent of 
Tyre,
 because reputing this latter a
parcell of the former.


§ 24. Many and great were the fortifications of 
Sidon:
 but in vain
was the arme of flesh with it, when God himself saith,
 
Behold I am
against thee O Zidon;
 whereupon in generall it felt the same destruction
with 
Tyre,
 which here we forbear to repeate. Onely we will adde, that
as bad a place as 
Sidon
 was; after Christs resurection a Church was
quickly converted therein; and Saint 
Paul
 sailing to 
Rome
 touched here,
and was courteously refreshed by his
 friends.


§ 25. Near the east-gate of 
Sidon
 they shew the place, where the 
Sy∣rophenician

woman begged so importunately for the cure of her daughter,
not disheartned though likened to a
 dog, by our Saviour. In deed she
shewed one of the best qualities of a dog in keeping her hold where
once she had well fastened, not giving over or letting goe, untill she
had gotten what she desired.


§ 26. So much for the City of 
Sidon.
 The Countrey of 
Sidon
 was larger,
adequate almost to 
Phenicia,
 and full of many fair harbours. Amongst
these
 
Zarephah
 or 
Zarepta,
 styled both in the
 old and
 new Testament, 
a
City of Sidon.
 The land round about it was fruitfull of the best Wine,
as we have
 formerly observed. During the three years drought in 
Israel

here dwelt that widow, whose thrift had so evenly ordered her bread
and oile, that a little of both were left, till she got a spring in her cruse by
entertaining the Prophet 
Elijah.
 As for her son
 restored to life by 
Elijah,

that he was 
Ionah
 that eminent Prophet, it may be ranked with the
making of 
Dinah Iacobs
 daughter to be 
Iobs
 wife, and with 
Ruth
 her
being daughter to 
Eglon
 King of 
Moab;
 all which three traditions are
equally improbable in themselves, altogether ungrounded on Scri∣pture,
and yet peremptorily affirmed of the Jewish Doctors. Nor have
I ought else to observe of this City, save that the Hebrew name of 
Za∣rephah,

signifieth a 
conflatory
 or 
melting place,
 where metals, (whereof
plenty in this Province) were made fu
il by the fire in their furnaces.


§ 27.
 
Accho
 remains to be observed in the south part of this Tribe,
and confines of 
Zebulun.
 A learned
 writer conceiveth it called 
Ace
 by
Grecians from affording medicine (
 in Greek) to 
Hercules,
 when
hurt in his conflict with the 
Lernaean Serpent.
 Whereas indeed 
Ace
 is
plainly derived from 
Accho
 the Scriputre name of this City. Thus those
who take aime from the Greek tongue to shoot at the Etymologies of
Hebrew places, come wide of the mark. This city was afterwards cal∣led

Ptolemais
 from one of the Kings of 
Egypt.
 Here I forbear to recite
how 
Ionathan,
 through the perfidiousness of 
Tryphon
 and his own over


credulity, was
 trained into this city, taken and murdered. Saint 
Paul

sailing from 
Tyre
 touched here,
 
saluted the brethren, and abode with them
one day.
 As for 
Achzib
 a city of 
Asher
 whence they could not expell the

Canaanites,
 it was seated nine miles north of 
Ptolemais,
 being a tolerable
harbour, and called 
Ecdippa
 afterwards.


§ 28. Many were the rivolets in this Tribe, but those no sooner de∣livered
out of the wombe of their fountains, but devoured in the grave
of the Ocean; onely 
Belus
 hath got a name (though not in Scripture)
running through the 
Cendevian
 Lake, famous for its
 inexhausted sands,
turning all things it toucheth into glass. As for the sepulcher of 
Memnon,

whom the Poets feign the son of the Morning, and
 
Iosephus
 erects his
monument near the river 
Belus;
 we take no notice thereof, being hereaf∣ter
to finde his tombe,
 
the dew of whose birth is as the wombe of the morning,

in a far distant place.


§ 29. The Armes usually assigned to 
Asher
 are azure,
 a standing cup
covered Or, relating to 
Iacobs
 blessing,
 
he shall yeeld royall dainties.
 A cup
being taken here by a Synedochicall metonymie for all plentifull Provi∣sions,

Asher
 otherwise affording dishes as well as cups, and esculents as
well as variety of beverage. But should the shield of this Tribe be as
full of charge as the land thereof was fruitfull of commodities, what
was the credit of the countrey would be the disgrace of the 
Coate
 of

Asher.








Here the Map of 
Zebulun
 is to be inserted.













THE TRIBE OF ZEBVLVN. CHAP. 6.


§ 1. 
Z
Ebulun
 tenth son of 
Iacob
 by 
Leah
 his wise had his
posterity so increased in 
Egypt,
 that
 fifty seven
thousand four hundred were extracted from
him. All which dying in the wilderness for
their manifold disobedience, their next genera∣tion
being
 sixty thousand five hundred posses∣sed
the land of 
Canaan.
 Honourable mention on all occasions is made
of this Tribe in Scripture. How forw
rd were they in their expedition
against 
Sisera,
 in so much as
 
out of Zebulun they came down that handled
the pen of the writer;
 Gown-men turned Sword-men, Clerks became Cap∣tains,
changing their penknives into swords. Thus the peaceableness
of their profession can bail none to stay at home, when eminent dan∣ger
arrests all at the suite of the Commonwealth to serve in person a∣broad.

David
 calls them the 
Princes
 of Zebulun &c.
 and well might he
afford them that style of dignity, who attended him at 
Hebron
 with an
army so absolutely accomplished


For



1 Number,
 
fifty thousand.


2 Skill,
 expert in war, which could keep ranke.


3 Weapons,
 with all instruments of war.


4 Loyalty,
 they were not of double hearts.




Yet in all ages, of all the numerous Tribe of 
Zebulun,
 we finde but
two Grandees expressed by name,
 
Elon
 a peaceable Judge, and 
Ionah
 an
eminent Prophet. But what shall we say? 
A greater then Ionah was here,

even Christ himself, the honour and dishonour (though not of the tribe)
of the land of 
Zebulun:
 honor, because here miraculously conceived, poorly
& painfully bread & brought up, here frequent in preaching & working
of miracles: dishonour, because carelesly neglected and scornfully
contemned, yea dispightfully persecuted of his own countreymen.


§ 2. 
Zebulun
 had 
Asher
 on the north-west,
 
Naphtali
 on the north-east,

Issachar
 on the south, the Mediterranean on the west, and 
Galilean
 sea on


the east thereof. This maritime position of this Tribe 
Iacob
 foresaw in his
Prophecy,
 
Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the Sea, and he shall be for an
haven of ships, and his border shall be unto Zidon.
 Which Charter of sea con∣veniencies
is renewed, and enlarged by 
Moses
 in his blessing, 
Rejoyce

 Zebulun in thy going out, and Issachar in thy tents. They shall call the people unto
the mountains, and there shall they offer Sacrifices of righteousness, for they shall
suck of the abundance of the Seas, and treasures hid in the sand.
 Where though
these two Tribes be made Partners, and joint sharers in marine interests,
and are promised equall profit thereby, yet 
Issachar
 it seems loved land
and an home life best, imploying his canvase rather for 
Tents,
 then 
Sails,

whilest the sea and 
going out
 in long voiages was rather 
Zebuluns
 delight.
So have I seen chickens and ducklings hatched under the same hen,
no sooner unhoused out of their shels, but presently the one falls a pec∣king
on the ground, the other a padling in the water.


§ 3. Nor let any be staggered at the close of 
Iacobs
 Prophecy,
 where∣in
he foretelleth, 
Zebuluns border shall be unto
 Sidon,
 finding this Tribe to
fall many miles short and south of that place. For 
Sidon
 is not there to
be taken for the City but Countrey
 so named. And the land of the

Sidonians
 or 
Phenicians,
 extended to 
Accho
 or 
Ptolemais
 a city thereof, on
which the north bound of 
Zebulun
 did confine. Greater will be the
difficulty to assigne a cleare reason, why in the 
first book of Chronicles,

where the Pedegrees of all the other Tribes are reckoned up; 
Zebulun

and 
Dan
 (as considerable and deserving as the rest) is omitted. The
best is, places not persons concern our present subject, and I hope I shall
not betray such indiscretion to leave the plain and ready Rode of my
work in hand, to enter into the wood (not to say the bog) of an im∣pertinent
question.


§ 4. We begin with the sea of 
Galilee
 the eastern boundary of this
Tribe,
 called always a sea by three of the Evangelists, but generally
a Lake by Saint 
Luke.
 Indeed amongst lakes it may be accounted for
a Sea, such the greatness; amongst seas reputed for a lake, such the
sweetness and freshness of the water therein. The extent thereof is most
variously reported amongst Authors.




 
Iosephus
 makes it an hundred furlongs long, and sixe broad.


 
Pliny
 measures it to be sixteen miles long, and six broad.


 
Munster
 assignes it to be twenty German miles (eighty English)
in compass.


 
Bunting
 contracts it to twelve in length, four miles and somewhat
more in breadth.


 
Biddulph
 a late English Divine, and eye-witness thereof computes
it eight leagues in length and five in breadth (three miles to all
leagues) whom for the main we have followed.




Others assigne it other dimensions, all agree it is not very great. But
what it wants in bigness, it hath in variety of names, called the Sea

of




1 
Cinnereth
 onely in the old
 Testament from a City of that name
in the Tribe 
Naphtali.
 Others conceive it so named from 
Kinnor,

an 
Harp
 in Hebrew, which it is said in shape to resemble: sure
the high winds, sometimes make but bad musick (to the eares
of mariners) when playing thereupon.


2
 
Gennesareth


3
 
Tiberias.


cities of note in our Saviours time flourishing thereon.


4
 
Galilee,
 the countrey which almost on all sides surrounded it.




Small vessels sometimes termed
 
 
Ships,
 sometimes 
,

 
Boates
 or 
Barges,
 went to and again in this sea, Gally-like
 sailing or

 rowing (or perchance both) as they saw their advantage. They were
little of strength, (because no Pirates to molest them) and not great of
burthen, not comparable to the ship wherein Saint 
Paul
 sailed on the
Mediterranean Sea, carrying two
 hundred threescore and sixteen souls,
which for the greatness thereof might be Admirall of all the Navy in
the new Testament. The river of 
Iordan
 runneth through the midst of
this Sea, and mingleth not therewith, but preserveth his own stream
intire: which some impute to the swiftness, yea rapidness of his course,
not at leasure to take notice of (much less to unite with) any water he
meets in the way, before he come to his journeys end at the dead Sea.


§ 5. This was the onely and all the seas,
 that ever our Saviour sailed
upon. It is reported of wise 
Cato,
 that he repented he ever went thither
by Sea, whither he might have gone by land. But see here 
Wisdome it
self
 (who by going about might have passed to any place on the other side
of the Sea) preferred the use of a ship, not to spare his own pains,
(whereof none more liberall) but
to



1 Shew natures intent of the Sea, made as well to be sailed, as the
ground to be gone upon.


2 Take occasion to manifest his Deity in working of miracles
thereon.


3 Comfort seafaring-men in their distresses, praying to such a Sa∣viour
as had an exprerimentall knowledge of the danger on
both elements.




And here, amongst the many voyages of our Saviour (who often
crossed the length and breadth of this sea-lake) let us take account of
some most remarkable. And first in generall we may observe, that after
the working of some extraordinary miracle, (which might have great
influence on peoples affections) as the feeding of so many thousands,
Christ presently put to sea (clouding himself in obscurity) and shun∣ning
popularity so far, that it should venture a drowning, if offering to
follow after him.


§ 6. The first voyage we will insist on,
 was when our Saviour sailed
in 
Simons
 ship, who formerly had fished all night, getting nothing
save a drowzie head and empty hands, untill casting his net at Christs


command, he caught such store of fish, both his and his partners ship
began to sink. O when will any earthly thing fall out even to our de∣sires!
We always finde fish, either none at all, or too many; and a sur∣feit
of wealth is as dangerous as a famine thereof. The fish were now
ready to return into the water from whence they came, and not by their
wit, but weight had caught their fishermen, had not Christ by miracle
brought all safe to shore.


§ 7. A second when the Disciples put to sea at the command,
 but
without the person of their Master. Tossed they were on the waves,
rowing with great pains to little purpose, 
for the wind was contrary,
 till
looking at last
 they see 
Iesus
 walking on the water; Then were the
words of the Psalmist literally true,
 
Thy way is in the Sea, and thy path in the
great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
 The Disciples unable to con∣ceive
such a mystery conclude it was a Ghost. It is not worth our en∣quiry,
what Ghost, or whence, good or evill, of man or devill, this wild
guess being the effect of their fright, then which no more professed foe to
a cleare judgment. Christ quickly discovering himself, 
Peter
 requests a
commission to meet him: which granted, he walks for a while on the
water, till his Faith first, then feet failing him, he began to answer the
name of 
Cephas,
 proving himself a 
stone,
 not by the stability, but the
heaviness thereof, 
and began to sink,
 till Christ saved him. Nor was
Christ sooner in the ship, but the ship was
 at the land. Thus those
many strokes at the oares which the Disciples had taken before, were
not meerly lost, but onely laid up, and now restored them in their speedy
arrivall. Yea the sails of the ship were not now on the mast, but in
the keel thereof, Christs person did the deed. Thus projects driven on
without Gods gracious presence are but driven on, whilest such designes
fly to their wished end, which take God along with them.


§ 8. The third and last voyage we will insist on,
 was when the ship
was not upon but under the sea,
 
covered with the waves.
 Yea, 
it was now
full of
 water,
 and the Disciples of fear, whilest Christ him self was fast a∣sleep,
having a pillow under his head, and a softer under his heart, a clear
conscience. See we here our Saviour a perfect, because an imperfect
Man, his infirmities speake the reality of his humanity. Working had
made him weary, weariness had caused him to sleep much out of a de∣sire
to be refreshed, more out of a designe to be awaked. Here all cry out,

Master save us, we perish.
 Danger will make the profane to pray, the wil∣full-dumbe
to speak, who will finde a tongue, rather then lose a life.
No doubt 
Iudas
 himselfe, who afterwards sold him, was now
as clamorous as any to be saved by him. Christ awakes, and rebukes
first the Disciples
 for being too fearfull, and despairing, then the winds
and waves, for being too bold and presumptuous. Both obey, owning
their Creatours voice; as well may his words, who made them at first,
make them now to be quiet.



§ 9. Many more were the voiages our Saviour made on the Sea,
 as
when after the feeding of so many thousands, they had but 
one
 loafe in
the ship,
 and on our Saviours caveat of the leaven of the Pharisees, their
jealousies grew solicitous for food. Had they not besides that one loafe
in their Cup-board, twelve moe in their memory (five at one batch,
and seven at another) on the recollection whereof their mindes might
feed, to depend on providence, especially whilest the founder of the
feast was in their company. But we who condemne them, are too likely
to commit the like distrust, if left to our selves, upon less occasion. To
return to our Saviour, it is observable that after his resurrection, we
read not that he sailed any more upon the Seas. For such a fluctuating
and turbulent condition, which necessarily attends sea-voyages, was
utterly inconsistent with the constancy, stability, and perpetuity of
Christs estate when risen from the grave. The firme land therefore
better agreeing with his fixed and immoveable happiness, thereon he
stood, and onely gave the word of command to his disciples at Sea, on
which side they should cast forth their net, when they caught so
 many
fishes. And so much for the 
Sea of Tiberias,
 hoping that if the weakly
reader be sea-sick by staying so long on the water, he will instantly be
well upon our arrivall on the main land, to which now we proceed.


§ 10. As this Tribe did overflow in sea conveniences;
 so it fell not
short in the commodities of the land. The countrey thereof was ena∣melled
with pleasant rivers, whose bankes were adorned with fair Ci∣ties.
We will follow the chanells of those rivers, which will direct
us to the most considerable places in 
Zebulun;
 beginning with 
little
Iordan.
 Indeed so 
little,
 that there is no mention thereof at all in
Scripture, and little in other Authors,
 
Mercator
 being one of the first
in my observation that takes notice thereof. It ariseth in the south part
of the vale of 
Iephtael,
 and running full east is augmented from the
south with the tribute of another brook, fetching his course by 
Naza∣reth

an eminent place, and famous in the new Testament.


§ 11. 
Nazareth
 was seated on 
the brow of an hill,
 in the very center of
this Tribe:

so called (as Saint
 
Hierom
 will have it) from a flower
which it signifieth in Hebrew, because Christ, that 
Prime
 Rose
 and

Lily,
 had here his conception. For though he saw his first light at 
Beth∣lehem,

he sucked his first breath in 
Nazareth,
 where his mother lived till
very near the time of her delivery. Also here he afterwards had his
poor and painfull education, working on his Fathers trade (as it is
probable from the words of the Evangelist,
 
Is not this the Carpenter?
)
though who would not have rather looked for a Scepter, then an Axe in
his hand, who was born 
King of the Iews?


§ 12. His short and secret abode at 
Bethlehem,
 long and publique
living at 
Nazareth,
 gave the ground to the then vulgar errour, that he was
born in this place. To foment this popular mistake, and disguise the


truth of Christs nativity (so to leave the 
Iews
 at the greater loss concern∣ing
their 
Messiah
) the devills (who knew full well that he was 
Iesus

of 
Bethlehem
 by birth) publiquely called him 
Iesus
 of Nazareth,
 the re∣putation
of that place running so low in common account, that
 
no good

could thence be expected. This nickname of 
Nazareth,
 first publick∣ly
fastened (as some conceive) by 
Satan
 on our Saviour, stuck by him all
his life, yea at his death, (fixed by 
Pilate
 in his title on
 the Cross) yea
after his ascension, so that such as believed on him, and embraced his
doctrine, were opprobriously termed, 
the sect of the
 Nazarens.


§ 13. Here also some (otherwise good and learned) men,
 are guilty
of another mistake, in making Christ one of the 
Legall Nazarites

(whence groweth the length of his hair in most pictures) who by ver∣tue
of their
 vow were tied to many ceremonious observances. Whereas
our Saviour frequently
 drank wine, familiarly touched the dead & took

 them by their hands, (and probably therefore a Rasor touched his head)
both the former being expresly forbidden the 
Mosaicall Nazarites,
 during
the days of their separation. Yet how our Saviour is tearmed 
a Nazaren

in reference, it may seem, amongst others, to that Prophecy,
 
And there shall
come out a Rod out of the stem of Iesse, and a branch [
] shall grow out of his
roots,
 we leave to the learned Commentators on that Text.


§ 14. During our Saviours living at 
Nazareth
 after he entered into
the Ministery,

he bestowed a Sermon on this place of his education,
and having found out his text
, 
Isa.
 61. 1.



1 
He closed his book.
 Not in any vaine ostentation of his memory;
but because either his Auditours were so well versed in the
letter of the Scripture, that they could tell by heart any
quotation he should cite therein: or rather, because out
of his fulness of divine knowledge and wisedome, himself had
no more need of it; and he would thereby fasten the more
their eares, and his tongue to that one text which was of so maine
concernment and importance unto them.


2 
And he gave it againe to the Minister.
 Of him he received, to him he
restored it, and coming in 
Reader
 by his leave, he would not
undermine the 
Incumbent,
 of the place, but honoured him in the
presence of his people. Hereby also he might haply shew that
Ministers are to keep Gods word, not as hucksters in gross, but
as Stewards to dispense it.


3 
And sat down.
 Professor-like, to shew his authority, and the
steadiness of his doctrine. In 
England
 the Pastour onely stands,
whilest the people sit; yet we envy not their ease, nor begrudge
our own paines; any posture shall please us, which may pro∣fit
them.


4 
And the eyes of all were fastened on him,
 (advantaged likely thereun∣to
by the round and pillar-less structure of their Synagogue)


not sleeping there, nor gazing about, nor reading, an action (like

Achitophel
 his
 counsell) good, but not at that time:



But thus fixing their eyes to help their attention, and express their longing
desire to know how he would interpret that famous place of Scripture;
as also for the fame that they had heard of him, who without study and
ordinary meanes became so incomparable a Teacher
. And yet curi∣osity
as much as true devotion may seem to cause this their attention;
seeing they who out of novelty were ready to eate his words, soon after
out of cruelty were more ready to devoure the speaker, contemning
him for the poverty of his parentage, person and kindred, and hating
him for the truth he delivered, 
that a Prophet is not without honour but in his
own Countrey.


§ 15. How this comes to pass,
 let others largely dispute. We may in
briefe conclude, it is partly because their cradles can be remembred,
and those swadling-cloathes, once used about them, to strengthen them
whilest infants, are afterwards abused against them, to disgrace them
when men, and all the passages of their childhood repeated to their
disparagement. Partly because all the faults of their family (which
must be many in a numerous alliance) are charged on the Prophets
account. Wherefore that Prophet who comes at the first in full growth
from a far forein place (not improving himselfe amongst them
from a small spark, to a fire, to a flame; but sunlike arising in perfect
lustre) gaines the greatest reputation amongst people: Because in some
respect he is like 
Melchisedek,
 without Father, without Mother, without de∣scent,

whilst the admiring vulgar, transported with his preaching, and
ignorant of his extraction on earth, will charitably presume his Pede∣gree
from heaven, and his breeding, as calling, to be divine.


§ 16. The cruell 
Nazarites
 brought Christ to the brow of the hill,

with full intent to cast him down headlong. All in vaine. For 
Christs

death was to come a clean contrary way, not by 
throwing him down,
 but
by
 
lifting him up. And he passing thorow the midst of them went his way.
 Not
that (as the
 Rhemists interpret it, to make way for their transubstanti∣ation)
he penetrated contrary to the nature of a body, thorow the ve∣ry
breasts of the people, but that either he smote them with blindness,
that they did not see, or else struck them with fear, that they dared not
to stay him, the power of his Person wedge-like cleaving its way, and
forcing a lane for his passage in the midst of the people.


§ 17. Expect not here 
hat I should write any thing of the opinions
of the hereticall 
Nazarenes,
 taking their name from this City of 
Naza∣reth,

and are commonly (but corruptly) called 
Nostranes
 at this day.
Much less will I trouble my self and the reader, with the severall stages
of the Chappel of the Angelical-salutation. A Chappell which well
may pity the pains and perils of such pilgrims as repair thereunto,
having it self had an experimentall knowledge how tedious travail is


in its own often removealls: flitting first from
 
Nazareth
 to 
Flumen
 a
City in 
Illyrium,
 thence for the unworthiness of the inhabitants transla∣ted
to a wood in the 
Picene
 field, and thence again (because the wood
was infected with theeves) carried by Angels into the ground of two
brethren, who falling out about parting the profit thereof, was the
fourth and last time conveyed into the high way, where ever since (not
because weary but welcome) it is pleased to make its abode. But I
remember the precept of the Apostle,
 
nor give heed to fables;
 and there∣fore
proceed to more profitable matter.


§ 18. To returne to 
Nazareth,
 the nameless rivolet arising near
thereunto,
 runneth north betwixt 
Dothan
 on the east, and 
Sephoris
 on
the west. At the former 
Ioseph
 was conspired against by his brethren.
The cause of their hating of him (besides his Fathers loving him)
was the reporting what he saw in his sleep, (dreames of his future pre∣ferment)
and what he saw waking, (no dreames of his brethrens
present
 debauchedness) who resolved to murther him. O how 
they

 saw the anguish of his soul,
 made visible in his bended knees, held up
hands, weeping eyes, wailing words, and all to no purpose! Into the
pit he is put, whilst his brethren
 fall a feasting: oh with what heart
could they say grace, either before, or after meat, whilst it was so sad
with 
Ioseph!
 Stars they say are seen the clearest (even in day time) by
those that are in deep pits. Surely divine providence appeared brightest
to 
Ioseph
 in that condition. Indeed
 
Reuben
 endevoured his restitution
to his Father;
 
Iudah
 his preservation from death; but neither being
privy to others designe, unwittingly countermined one another, had
not God wrought all for the best. 
Ishmaelitish
 Merchants, and 
Midianites

in their company, pass by, bearing Spices, and Balm, and myrrh to
carry down into
 
Egypt.
 To them 
Ioseph
 is sold, of whom we take our
leave for the present; not doubting in due time and place to meet him a∣gain.
Mean time may those merchants be carefull to carry him safe;
for among all the spices they were laden with, none more fragrant and
precious, then the perfume of this captives innocence. So much for

Dothan,
 onely I will adde that I have placed it here, out of a peace∣able
compliance with the judgements of learned men, otherwise I shall
not spare to manifest my private opinion
 on just occasion.


§ 19. On the west of this rivolet, was 
Sephoris,
 afterwards called 
Dio-caesa∣rea;

not to be omitted (though not mentioned in Scripture) because ac∣counted
by
 
Iosephus,
 the greatest City in 
Galilee,
 where the Jewish San∣hedrin
for some time had its residence. Let the same Authour inform
you, how this City was burned by 
Varus,
 how molested by the sediti∣ous,
how basely it deserted 
Iosephus,
 was bravely recovered by him,
plundred by his souldiers, and the spoile thereof restored again, with
severall passages of high concernment in the Jewish history. A little
more northward, this brook falls into 
Iordan
 the less, which afterwards
payes its tribute to the sea of 
Galilee.



§ 20. Which sea runneth Southward by
 
Gittah-hepher,
 or 
Gath-hepher

as most place it, the birth-place of
 
Ionah
 the Prophet. His name in
Hebrew a 
Dove,
 to which he answered rather in his speedy
 flight from
Gods service, then in any want of 
Gall,
 whereof he manifested too much
in his
 anger without cause or measure. 
Iona
 therefore being born
here in the heart of neather 
Galilee,
 no less untrue, then uncharitable
was that assertion of the high 
Priests
 and 
Pharisees;
 
Search and look, for
out of Galilee cometh no Prophet.
 Except their words herein referred to the
future, not to what was passed, and that also onely in relation to the
Prophet Paramount, the 
Messiah
 of 
Israel.
 More south, the sea ran by

Magdala
 a turreted town (as the name thereof imports:) and common
tradition is all the argument we have, that 
Mary
 surnamed 
Magdalen

that eminent penitent, was so called from this place, because living (o∣thers
say richly landed) therein. Into the coasts
 of 
Magdala
 Christ
came from sea, when the 
Pharisees
 tempted him to shew them a signe
from heaven. In the parallel place in the Gospell of Saint 
Mark
 the
same Countrey is called 
Dalmanutha;
 different names (it seems) for the
same territory.


§ 21. Going forward on the sea side,

still southward, we meet with
the influx of a riyolet thereunto, fetching his fountain from the heart
of the Countrey, near the City of 
Bethulia,
 nigh unto which was acted
the atchievments of 
Iudith
 against 
Holofernes.


§ 22. Form 
Bethulia
 the rivolet running full east, is swallowed up
in the 
Galilean Sea,
 beholding the high seated City of 
Iotopata,
 some two
miles distant from the inlet thereof. The stout defending of this place
against the 
Romans,
 with no less wisdome, then valour, was the master∣piece
of 
Flavius Iosephus,
 in the behalfe of his Countrey-men. And now
having made necessary mention of his name, pardon a digression in
giving a free Character of his writings, whereof, next holy writ, we
have made most use in this book.


§ 23. It must be confessed that he was guilty of some unexcusable
faults:
 namely
of



Boasting immoderately of his own birth, valour, learning,
piety.


Levity, inserting frivolous fables of the root Boras &c. And yet
we will not confine natures power to our beliefe, concluding
that impossible which we conceive improbable.


Flattery of the Roman Emperours 
Vespasian
 and 
Titus,
 (a catching
disease, wherewith the soundest Authours in that age were
infected) and that so gross, that it seems not limn'd with a
Pencill, but dawb'd with a Trowell.




But all these may be winked at, with a charitable eye, were he not al∣so
guilty of falsity: appearing first in his faults of
 omission, not mention∣ing
the Jewish Idolatry, in making the 
Calfe,
 nor the disobedience of 
Moses



their Ministerial Legislator in smiting the 
Rock,
 which 
Moses
 himself, wri∣ting
of himself, thought fitting to relate. Secondly, of Cōmission, stuffing
his history with improbable tales of 
Moses
 loving the Lady 
Tarbith &c.

and some mistakes contradictory to holy writ. When we meet with
any such in him relating to this present work, we have made bold (the
Sun is not to be set by dials, but dials by the Sun) to alter and rectifie his
extravagancies according to Scripture. Notwithstanding all these faults,
the main bulk of his book deserves commendation, if not admiration;
no doubt at the first compiled, and since preserved by the speciall provi∣dence
of God, to reflect much light and lustre upon the Scriptures. His
last book 
De bello Iudaico
 is the best Comment on that part of the twenty
fourth Chapter of Saint 
Matthew,
 which concerns the destruction of the
City and Temple. As for the censure of 
Baronius,
 it is too harsh and un∣charitable,
charging him with
 
absurda & portentosa mendacia,
 seeing that it
cannot appear, that 
Iosephus
 willingly and wittingly made those mistakes.
Wherefore such chance-medly amounts not to manslaughter, much
less to wilfull murther; not to say, that the charitable Reader ought to
be a 
City of refuge
 to such Authors, who rather unhappy, then unfaith∣full,
fall into unvoluntary errours. In a word, historians, who have no
fault are onely fit to write the actions of those Princes and people, who
have no miscariages, and onely an Angels pen taken from his own
wing is proper to describe the story of the Church triumphant.


§ 24. We still follow the Sea shore southward,
 and light on the
place where our Saviour standing in a ship taught the people on the
land in his
 Sermon full of parables. A Sermon not unlike the pillar
of cloud and fire, which gave light to the 
Israelites
 at the red sea,
 
but was a
cloud of darkness to the Egyptians:
 because his preaching then obscure and
parabolicall to the common people, was privately expounded, and
made plain unto his disciples.


§ 25. At last we are come to the City of 
Tiberias,
 so named by 
Herod

the Tetrarch in honour of 
Tiberius
 the Roman Emperour. A populous
City, and which gave the name to the neighbouring sea, thence termed

 
the sea of Tiberias.
 Near to this place
 Christ fed five thousand men
with five loaves and two fishes. Afterwards he went over the sea, but
how and which way, grudge not Reader to peruse this following ac∣count
given us b
 a
 learned man, an eye-witness of the place.


§ 26. 
It is said Iohn 6. 1. that Iesus went over the sea of Galilee: and in a∣nother
place that he went beyond the lake: and Luke 9. 10. it is said that he went
into a solitary place near unto a City called Bethsaida; which place of Iohn I lear∣ned
to understand better by seeing it, then ever I could before by reading it. For
seeing that Tiberias and Bethsaida, were both Cities on the same side of the sea,
and Christ went from Tiberias to or near unto Bethsaida: I gather thereby that our
Saviour Christ went not over the length or breadth of that sea, but over some arme,
bosome, or reach thereof, viz. so far as Tiberias was distant from Bethsaida, which


is also confirmed in that it is said elsewhere,
 a great multitude followed him on foot
thither; which they could not have done, if he had gone quite over the sea, to the o∣ther
side among the Gergesens. 
So far our author, with whose judgement
I am moved to concurre.


§ 27. More southward,
 the sea of 
Tiberias
 leaveth the Tribe of 
Ze∣bulun,

and entereth into 
Issachar.
 Come we therefore now to describe
the remaining places of note in this Tribe, most of them being seated
on, or near the river of 
Kishon,
 whose course we will observe. It is called
by
 
Deborah, the ancient river the river Kishon.
 And why ancient? are not
all rivers of equall antiquity, and the same seniority, seeing 
Gen.
 1. (the
Register book of the age of all creatures) they were made in the third
day, when this lower globe was distinguished into earth and water
?
No surely, though this be true of originall and primitive rivers, many
since have been of a second edition, occasioned by 
Noahs
 flood, earth∣quakes,
eruptions of waters after long raine; not to speake of many o
thers
derived by art and industry. Thus we discourse with our selves
whilest


Tremellius
 takes away the subject of the question rendering

, or the 
Ancient river, torrens occursuum,
 or 
the river of meetings.
 Not
that many tributary rivolets met therein (a probable sense on the first
sound) but (as he
 expounds himself) because the armie of 
Israel
 there a∣gainst

Sisera
 appeared in their generall Rendezvous.


§ 28. However, 
Kishon
 was a fair River, and surely the same which
is termed by 
Ptolemy Choriaeus.
 Entering with a full and large streame
(next to 
Iordan
 in breadth, depth, and swiftnesse) 
into the land of Zebulun,

it divideth it self according to the observation of our
 Author (if not
hypercriticall herein) into two channels, the one, and that the lesser,
running east (commonly called 
Kadumim
) and falleth into the
sea of 
Galilee,
 the other rushing northwestward, and emptieth it
self into the Mediterranean. Nigh the banks of the former stands
the famous mountain of 
Tabor,
 generally conceived to have been
the place of Christs transfiguration, where
 
Moses
 and 
Elias
 were seen
talking with him. 
Origen
 (according to his 
allegorising of the text
) saith
that thereby was signified, the harmony betwixt the Law, the Prophets,
and the Gospell, all agreeing together. But here I cannot but smile at
what
 
Breidenbachius
 reports (who travelled up this mountain) 
Ibi etiam
hodie ostenduntur ruinae trium tabernaculorum secundum desiderium Petri constru∣ctorum,
there
 (saith he) 
even at this day, are shewed the ruines of those three ta∣bernacles built according to Peters desire.
 In very good time no doubt. I con∣fess
one Scripture saith, 
Aske and yee shall have
, but another Text answer∣eth
it, 
Yee aske and
 because yee aske amiss;
 and improbable it is,
that God would grant the desire (or rather distempter) of 
Peter;
 and
that his wish should come to him, who was not come to himself, by
reason of his great fear, amazement, and extasie of joy. Besides, Ta∣bernacles
or Tents, being light, slight occasionall structures, make small


visible impressions in the earth, when set up; and leave no durable
footsteps to be seen so many hundred years after. So that herein, 
Breiden∣
ach

seemeth to speak (as S. 
Peter
 did in the same place) 
not
 knowing what he
said.
 More likely it is, that there may at this day remain some ruines of
Oratories erected many years since, seeing there was there a Monastery
inhabited by Friers, untill they being molested by the 
Arabians
 (to use
my
 Authors expression) 
took their holinesse away with them, and left the
mountain behind them.


§ 29. The greatest stream of 
Kishon
 runneth northward thorow the
midst of this Tribe,
 not far from the City of 
Naim,
 where Christ meeting
the widowes onely Child, carried forth to be buried, miraculously re∣stored
him to
 life. Hereabouts also was the City 
Aijalon,
 where
 
Elon

Judge of 
Israel
 was buried, of whom nothing else is recorded save his
name, time of his rule, ten years, and place of his interment. Slight him
not because so little is reported of him, it tending much to the praise of
his Policy in preventing forein invasions, and domestick commotions,
so that the land enjoyed peace; as far better then victory, as health is to
be preferred before a recovery from sickness. Yea times of much doing,
are times of much suffering, and many martiall a
chievements are rather
for the Princes honour, then the peoples ease.


§ 30. From 
Naim
 the river 
Kishon
 glides by the northern skirts of
mount 
Carmel,
 beholding the place where 
Eliah
 did execution on 
Baals
Priests,
 on this occasion. All 
Israel
 met on mount 
Carmel,
 concluding
him the true God, who answered by fire unto their sacrifices. 
Baals
Priests
 being vainly clamorous in invoking their Idol, whose petitions
finde no answer from heaven, except the echo in the aire descanting in
derision on their importunate bawlings; discontented hereat they
 cut
themselves with knives and lancers, the ready way to make bloud, but
not fire to come. Then enters 
Eliah
 on his work, and to prevent all suspi∣cion
of fraud, he three times caused four barrels of water to be powred
on the Altar. If any here demand how they came by such plenty of
water, a precious commodity after three years and six months drought,
when springs, wells, and brooks were
 dried up: it is answered, it was
fetched from the sea hard by, whose brackish water, though useless to
quench the thirsts of men and beasts, was proper enough therewithall to
trie the present experiment. Hereupon at 
Eliahs
 prayers, fire from heaven
licked up the water, and consumed the Sacrifice. The Prophet taking
advantage of this juncture of time, whilest the people of 
Israel
 were
possessed with an high opinion of his power and person, King 
Ahab

stood admiring at the miracle, 
Baals Priests
 stood dispirited with guilti∣ness
and wonder, and 
Iazebel
 their active Patroness absent at great
distance, being a single man, slew four hundred and fifty of them with∣out
any resistance. Formerly their flattering hands rather acting and
doing, did theatrically in superstitious formalities let out some drops of


wild bloud in the surface of their flesh, whereas now 
Eliah
 in true ear∣nest,
with an unpartial arme, gave vent to their heart bloud by the brook

Kishon,
 which presently carrieth both their gore, and its own water in∣to
the 
Mediterranean Sea.


§ 31. However though Satan then was silent,
 (when in credit most con∣cerned
to speak in answer to 
Baals Priests
) it seems he found his tongue
afterwards, and here pretended to informe people of their fortune. 
Sue∣tonius

tells us
 that 
Vespasian in Iudea took counsell from the oracle of the God
CARMELUS,
 w
ch
 foretold his good success in whatsoever he should
undertake, which 
God
 we conceive was some 
Spirit of delusion,
 (thogh then
speaking truly) having his residence in or nigh this mountain of 
Carmel.


§ 32. As for 
Carmel
 in generall,
 it was so delicious a place▪ that more
pleasure was hardly to be fancied, then here to be found. It consisted of
high hills, (where the wicked thought in vain by
 hiding themselves in
the height thereof, to be secured from divine justice) a 
fruitfull vale,
 plea∣sant
river of 
Kishom,
 and a goodly 
forrest,
 so that the feet of 
Sennacherib
 did
itch to
 
enter it,
 as his fingers did long to fell the fair 
Cedars
 in 
Lebanon.

From this 
Carmel,
 the platform of pleasure, other delightfull places are
so named (as copies and transcripts of this the originall) yea the name
is sometimes
 rendered appellatively for any fruitfull field.


§ 33. From the top hereof we may easily discover two neighbour∣ing
townes 
Cain
 and
 
Caiaphas,
 the one named from the murderer of

 
Abel;
 the other from the
 active contriver of his death,
 
whose bloud
speaketh better things then that of Abel.
 But neither appearing in Scripture,
it is enough to name them. More northerly we behold the valley of

Iiphthah-el,
 or river thereof, the same
 word in Hebrew expressing both,
as indeed it is hard to finde a vale, especially in winter, without a rivo∣let
therein. And if I mistake not, the 
BOURNE
 in 
Wilt-shire,
 and the
west, signifieth both the river and the dale down which it runneth. In
the vale nigh the river of 
Iiphthah-el
 stood the city 
Zebulun,
 so beautifully
built, saith
 
Iosephus,
 (let him forfeit his fingers when he measures any
thing to loss which concerns his own countrey) that 
Cestius
 the 
Roman
Governour
 who burnt it, admired the houses therein as corrivalls with
those of 
Tyre, Zidon,
 and 
Berytus
 in magnificence. More southward is

Cana
 called commonly 
the lesse,
 though greatened with 
Christs
 first mi∣racle
wrought there at a mariage, turning
 water into wine. How
many matches have been made, to which Christ was never invited
guest; yea the 
riot
 and revels thereat, would fright his gracious pre∣sence
from the place. Hence the rivolet
 runneth to 
Iokneam,
 surnamed

 of 
Carmel
 from the vicinity thereof; the King whereof was destroyed
by 
Ioshua,
 and the City afterwards bestowed upon the
 
Levites.


§ 34. Having mentioned the Levite-cities,
 an importunate diffi∣culty
(whilest I hoped silently to slip by it) plucketh me back in my
passage: It resulteth from the ensuing parallel.


Joshua 21. 34, 35.
 
And unto the families of the children of M
r
ri, the
rest of the Levites, out of the Tribe of 
Zebulun, Jokneam

with her suburbs, and 
Kartah
 with her suburbs, 
Dimnah

with her suburbs, 
Nahalol
 with her suburbs: four cities.
1 Chron. 6. 77.
 
Vnto the rest of the children of
Merari, was given out of the Tribe
of 
Zebulun, Rimmon
 with her sub∣urbs,

Tabor
 with her suburbs.


The difficulty is double: first four Cities are mentioned in 
Ioshua,
 and
but two in 
Chronicles.
 Secondly, those two fall out by their different
names, nothing like the four formerly assigned them.


§ 35. In solution hereof,
 some will say that the 
Levites
 might have six
cities in 
Zebulun.
 But why should this tribe being not the biggest be
most bountifull unto them? Was it because 
Zebuluns
 lot advantaged by
the sea-situation thereof, was larger in worth then in view; and so the
Merchant adventurers of this tribe, making gainfull voyages and pro∣fitable
returnes, were obliged in conscience to be more liberall to the
maintenance of Gods Ministers? Or are two of the 
Levites
 cities left out
in 
Chronicles
 (omission in such cases for reasons to us unknown is no
contradiction) and the other
 two the same (though unlike in sound)
with the two last mentioned in 
Ioshua.
 Indeed I deny not, but the towns
at the same time may have two names nothing alike, 
(Medena,
 aliàs

Newport,
 in the Isle of 
Wight
 may be an instance thereof.) But for all I
can finde, still I languish in expectation of a better solution. Yet let not
his good will be slighted, who though unable to cure the wound;
(whilest Commentatours on the place suffer it to lie festering in silence)
desires to wash it and keep it clean, till a more skilfull hand apply an
effectuall plaister thereunto.


§ 36. In 
Solomons
 division of the land into twelve purveyour-ships,


Zebulun
 had no distinct officer over him, but belonged to the territory
of 
Baanah
 the Son of 
Ahilud;
 who, besides many places he had in 
Ma∣nasseh,

extended his Jurisdiction
 
even beyond Iokneam.
 The Armes of

Zebulun,
 confirmed unto him by custome, and Rabbinicall tradition,
were 
Argent, a ship with Maste and tackling sable.
 An honourable 
Bearing,
 the
same with the 
Coate armour
 of 
Albertus free Baron of Alasco in Poland,
 
ave
that his ship is without sailes, (with this Motto, 
Deus dabit vela, God will
send sailes
) and 
Zebuluns
 accomplished with all the accoutrements thereof.






Here the Map of 
Issachar
 is to be inserted.













THE TRIBE OF ISSACHAR. CHAP. 7.


§ 1. 
ISsachar,
 the fift
 Son which 
Iacob
 begat on

Leah
 his wife, had his posterity so increa∣sed
in 
Egypt,
 that from thence came forth
of this Tribe 
fifty
 
four thousand and four hun∣dred.

All which falling in the wilderness,
for their frequent tempting of God, their
Sons grew 
(Iudah
 and 
Dan
 excepted) more
numerous then any other Tribe, inso∣much
that sixty four
 thousand and three hundred, 
of twenty years old
 and
upward, appeared at their second solemn muster in the 
plaines of Moab.
Tolah
 the Judge was of this Tribe; 
Baasha
 and 
Elah
 Kings of 
Israel

fair 
Abishag the Shunamite,
 wife (or
 rather bed-fellow) to aged 
David;

with another Lady (if in beauty, not in goodness her inferiour) of the
same city, who so kindly entertained the Prophet 
Elisha.


§ 2. 
Issachar
 had the sea
 on the west, 
Iordan
 on the
 east;
 
Zebulun
 on
the north, 
Manasseh
 on the south. A fair fruitfull countrey; for, as all

Canaan
 is called the 
pleasant
 land:
 so it is particularly observed of 
Issa∣chars

portion, he saw the 
land
 that it was pleasant, and bowed his shoulder to
bear, and became a servant unto tribute.
 This Tribe better acquitted it self in
the 
Subsidie,
 then in the 
Muster-book,
 they were the best 
Yeomantry
 of 
Israel,

towards the advancing of ra
es and taxes. They loved rest, and a seden∣tary
life. Blame them not, if sensible of the goodness of their soile, they
were loath to leave home, because certain to remove to their loss, and
are compared to 
an
 Asse couching between two burthens.


§ 3. Yet were not the men of 
Issachar
 of such servile natures,
 but that
they could be valiant, when just occasion was offered them. They were
as willing, and resolute as any other, in
 helping 
Barak
 in the battell a∣gainst

Sisera.
 Yet even then we may observe, they marched not far from
their own habitations, the field being fought in the bowells of their


countrey. And well might his 
Asse,
 finde both heels and teeth, to kick
and bite such, as offer to take his Hay from his rack and Provender a|
way from his manger.


§ 4. Nor let the resembling of 
Issachar
 to an 
Asse;
 depress this Tribe
too low in our estimation. The strength of his back, not stupidity of
his head, gave the occasion thereunto 
 in one point of excellent
skill, this Tribe surpassed all others, being 
men that had understanding of
the times,
 to know what Israel ought to doe.
 Now seeing time 
Ianus
-like hath
two faces, one looking backward 
[Chronology]
 the other forward 
[Prog∣nostication]

the question will be, in which of these lay the learning of the

Issacharites?
 A learned man
 conceives them onely like husbandmen,

weather-wise
 by their own rurall observations. Sure more is imported in
that expression, and not onely 
Almanack,
 but 
Chronicle-skill
 contained
therein; so that from deductions from former, they could make di∣rections
for the future times. Oh for a little of 
Issachars
 art in our age, to
make us 
understand
 these intricate and perplexed 
times,
 and to teach us to

know what we ought to doe,
 to be safe with a good conscience. So much of
the persons in this Tribe; come we now to survay the eminent places contained therein.


§ 5. In the south confines thereof stood the regal city of
 
Iezreel.
 For
though the valley of 
Iezreel
 belonged to
 
Manasseh,
 the city it self must
pertain to 
Issachar,
 otherwise the sixteen cities assigned him 
Iosh.
 19.
will fall short of that number. In 
Iezreel Ahab
 had a Princely Palace
(haply the 
joynter-house
 of 
Iezebel
) besides a
 
garden-house
 adjoining; and
here in the city lived 
Naboth,
 as hard by lay his vineyard, which 
Ahab

could not obtain from him, either by purchase or
 exchange.


§ 6. Some will finde more equity in 
Ahabs
 offers, then discretion in

Naboths
 refusall. But, blame him not, if loth to offend his God, to accom∣modate
his King. Being (no doubt) in his conscience perswaded that
his earthly possession, was the 
earnest
 of his heavenly inheritance, and
that his parting with the former, voided his title to the latter. Besides,
his vineyard (six hundred years since the partition of the land by lot)
had pertained to his ancestours (probably) moe ages, then 
Ahabs new
erected palace
 had belonged years to his family.


§ 7. On the denyall 
Ahab
 falls sullen-sick. No meat will down with
him for lack of a salad, because wanting 
Naboths
 vineyard for a garden
of herbes, till 
Iezebel
 undertook the business. A letter is made up of her
braines, her husbands hand and seal to the Elders of 
Iezreel,
 enjoining
them to set up two
 men of 
Belial,
 to accuse 
Naboth
 of blasphemy a∣gainst
God, and the King. She took it for granted, plenty of such per∣sons
were to be found in so populous, and vicious a place. Oh the an∣cient
order of 
Knight of the poste,
 for money to depose any falshood.
Hereupon 
Naboth
 is stoned to death, and his
 
Sons also,
 flatly contrary to
Gods command, which in this case had provided, 
The
 children shall not


be put to death for their fathers, but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.

But this was don
, to clear all claimes, and prevent all pretenders of ti∣
les
unto the inheritance.


§ 8. Thu
 
Naboths
 vineyard was for 
Ahabs
 use turned into a 
garden of

erbes.
 Surely the bitter wormwood of Divine revenge grew plenti∣
lly
there
n. Fo
 in the same place his Son 
Ioram,
 and gran-child 
Aha∣z
ah

had a martiall interview with 
Iehu,
 and were both worsted by him.
Here 
Iehu
 with a shot out of a bow (archery fatall both to
 
Ahab
 and
his Son) wounded 
Iehoram
 to the
 heart, and by speciall order to 
Bidkar


 Captain, commanded that his corps should be cast into the field of

Naboth
 the 
Iezr
lite.
 Oh the exact Topography observed in divine
justice! so accurate is God, not onely in the time, but place of his
punishment.


§ 9. Greater is the difficulty about the death of King 
Ahaziah
 slain
about the same time.
 For, whereas 
it is
 
appointed for all men once,
 he seem∣ed

twice to die,
 and that in far distant places.


2 Kings 9. 27.
 
But when Ahaziah the King of Iudah
saw this, he fled by the way of the Garden∣house,
and Iehu followed after him, and said,
Smite him also in the charet [and they did
so] at the going up to Gur, which is by I∣bleam:
and he fled to Megiddo, and died
there.


2 Chron. 22. 9.
 
And Iehu sought Ahaziah, and they
caught him (for hee was hid in Samaria)
and brought him to Iehu, and when they
had slain him, they buried him: because
said they, he is the Sonne of Iehosaphat,
who sought the Lord with all his
heart.


But all is reconciled, if we take 
Samaria,
 not for the city so named, but
for the whole kingdome of 
Israel,
 in which notion 
Ahab
 is styled 
King of

 Samaria,
 that is, the ten Tribes, whereof 
Samaria
 was the Metropolis.
In this acception, 
Megiddo,
 and all the passage thereunto was in 
Samaria,

where 
Ahaziah
 hoped in vaine, by his flight to hide, and conceale
himself.


§ 10. All thus agreed concerning the dea
h,
 I hope no difference will
arise about the buriall of 
Ahaziah.
 Though in one tex
 
his
 ow
 servants,

in another 
Iehu
 his men
 are said to bu
y him. The one might doe it by
the leave and licence of the other, and 
Iehu
 his souldiers did deliver 
Aha∣ziah's

de
d corps to his own servants, to interre it in 
Ierusalem.


§ 11. 
Iezebel
 survived not long after.
 As 
Iehu
 was entering 
Iezreel,

she (newly painted) entertains him with a taunt out of the window,
to try whether her tongue, or his sword were the sharper. We meet
but with three principall speeches of her in Scripture; the first an Idola∣trous
oath and curse, 
The
 Gods doe so to me, and more also:
 the next, a mor∣tall
threat, and lowd lye, 
If I make not Elijah's, like
 one of their lives by to mor∣row
this time:
 the last an impudent and unseasonable jeer, 
Had Zimri

 peace that slew his Master?
 Presently she is thrown down headlong, and
the dogs eat her up to the 
eversion of her
 
skull, palmes of her hands, and
feet.
 What, h
d the poison of her painting, 
 deeply pierced into these
the naked
 parts of her body, that the dogs were afraid to feed o
 them?


However it came to pass, 
Iezebels skull
 may be worn as a 
deaths-head
 in
the memories of all wicked persons, abusing their power, to minde
them of their certain ruin, without serious repentance. The heads also
of 
Ahabs
 children kill'd in 
Samaria,
 were laid in two heapes at the en∣trance
of the gates of
 
Iezreel.


§ 12. It may seem strange,
 that seeing 
Iehu
 was warranted by com∣mission
from heaven, in the execution of 
Ahabs
 family, and friends, that
God should afterwards threaten by his Prophet, 
I will
 avenge the bloud of
Iezreel upon the house of Iehu.
 But it seems, though herein 
Iehu
 his chariot
went in the path of Gods command, yet he did drive it on 
furiously,
 the
pace of his own cruelty, vainglory, and ambition. Thus, that officer is
a murderer, though acting the sentence of the Judge, if withall he plea∣seth
his private malice, in executing persons condemned to die. The
matter of 
Iehu
 his act was rewarded, the manner revenged by God.


§ 13. The river 
Kishon
 runneth through the midst of this Tribe,

which entring in at 
Naboths vineyard,
 taketh his course north-ward with
a winding channell, not far from 
Shamir in mount Ephraim,
 wherein 
Tola

the 
Iudge,
 or rather, the 
Iustice of peace
 in 
Israel
 (nothing of war being
achieved in his government) both dwelt,
 and was buried. Hence on
his western bank, 
Kishon
 beholds the place, where 
Barak
 fought that
famous battell against 
Sisera.
 It is recorded to the commendation of
such 
Israelites,
 as assisted him, that 
they took no gain of money.
 Indeed they
of 
Zebulun
 were by their calling
 
such as handled the pen,
 though now tur∣ned
sword-men, in case of necessity. And when men of peaceable pro∣fessions,
are, on a pinch of extremity for a short time, forced to fight,
they ought not, like 
souldiers of fortune,
 to make a tradeto enrich themselves
thereby, seeing defence of religion, life, and liberty, are the onely wages
they seek for in their service.


§ 14. In this most eminent battell,
 
the Stars in their courses fought a∣gainst
Sisera.
 What, are the numerous people of 
Israel
 meant thereby,
whom God
 promised to multiply as 
the Stars in heaven?
 or, are onely
the principall officers in their Army intended therein? Sure, it is safest
to embrace the literall sense, that those celestiall lights, frowning with
their malignant aspects, caused frights and fears in the hearts of the

Canaanites.
 Such, as utterly deny all influences of Stars on mens mindes,
shew therein, that the moon hath made too much impression on their
crazy judgements, and lunatick opinions.


§ 15. But, the river of 
Kishon
 was not onely a spectatour of this fight,
but also an actour of a principall part therein: For, when the 
Canaanites

routed in the battell, essayed to wade this river, so to recover their coun∣trey
on the other side, the streame thereof, probably lately made more
deep, and rapid with extraordinary raine (the largess of some wa
ry
Planet which fought for 
Israel
)
 
swept them away.
 So that what fragments
of these 
Canaanites,
 were left by the 
Israelites
 swords glutted with slaughter,

Kishon
 was the voider to take them clean away.



§ 16. Hence 
Kishon
 runneth on by 
Kishion
 (the vicinity of the name
is argument enough, to place it on the banks of this river) elsewhere

 called 
Kedesh,
 being one of the four cities in this Tribe, belonging
to the 
Levites
 Gershonites.
 More east whereof lay another of the same
nature, 
Engannim,
 called 
Ienine
 at this day, being now a very 
pleasant
 place,
having fine gardens, orchards, and waters about it,
 as it hath its Hebrew name
from a 
fountain.
 And that we may know, that the countrey hereabouts,
still retaineth more then the ruines of its former fertility, a judicious

 modern traveller tells us, that in his whole journey from 
Damascus
 to

Ierusalem,
 he saw not more fruitfull ground, and so much together, then
he did in two and twenty miles riding, betwixt 
mount Tabor
 and 
En∣gannim.


§ 17. Hence 
Kishon
 continuing his course northward,
 leaveth the ci∣ty

 
Shunem
 at some distance from his western bank, the birth-place of

Abishag,
 wife-nurse to King 
David,
 to procure
 heat to his decayed age.
Time was, when he boasted, 
that his youth was
 renewed as the eagles,
 but
eagles (notwithstanding the often casting of their bills, and years there∣with)
are at last seised on with age, and death, as it fared then with
decrepit 
David. Adonijah, David's
 Son, afterwards lost his life, for petition∣ing
to have this 
Abishag
 for his wife. What was his fault? Incest, or trea∣son?
Surely, neither effected, no, nor attempted in any clandestine way,
without leave from the King. Let it suffice, 
Solomon
 saw more, then we, in
this matter; his eies also not wanting the magnifying-glass of 
State-jealou∣sie,

to improve his discoveries herein. But, this accident was onely the 
hilt

or handle, for 
Solomon
 to take hold on; 
Adonijah's
 former fault was the
edge, to cut off his life. Thus, let those, who once have been desperately
sick of a Princes displeasure, and recovered, know, that the least relapse
will prove deadly unto them.


§ 18. In 
Shunem
 dwelt that worthy woman,
 who prevailed with her
husband, to harbour 
Elisha
 in his passage this way. Gods Prophets are
no lumber, but the most profitable stuffe wherewith an house can be
furnished. Landlords prove no losers by such Tenants, (though sit∣ting
rent-free) whose dwelling with them, pays for their dwelling with
them. At 
Elisha's
 prayer God made this woman (barren before) the hap∣py
mother of an hopefull
 Son. Somes years after, this child grown a
stripling, and going into his Fathers field to see his reapers, was there
smitten with a deadly sickness. So that the corn on the land might pass
for the emblem of this childs condition, save that that being ripe, and
ready wooed the cycles to cut it, whilst this green grain was mow'n
down in the blade thereof. 
At noon
 the child dyed.
 Had one the same
morning beheld the Sun arising out of the east, and this child coming
forth of his fathers house in perfect health, he would not have suspected,
that the noon of the one would prove the night to the other. But by the
prayers of 
Elisha
 he was restored again unto her.



§ 19. This 
Shunamite
 was afterwards seven years absent,
 in the land
of the 
Philistines,
 during which time, the profits of her estate, as appears
by the text,
x
 were seised on by the Kings officers.
 Custome (it seems)
intitled the Crown to their revenues, which resided not on their lands,
especially (if living as she did) in the land of a forein foe. She addressed
her self by petition to King 
Ioram,
 for restitution of her meanes. For∣merly
she had no use of the Prophets profer, 
to
 speake for her to the King,
or to the Captain of the host,
 who now was fain to prefer her suit in her own
person. None know what hereafter may befall them. Such, whose
young feet were onely taught to traverse their own ground, may in their
old age be learnt a harder lesson, to trudge abroad in attendance to o∣thers.

Gehazi
 happily there present, attests her the woman whose Son
was restored to life, and by the Kings command, her lands and profits
were restored to he. Let her, under God, thank 
Elisha
 for this favour; for,
that place in her house, where his
 
bed, table, stool, and candlestick
 stood,

kept possession
 for her in her absence, of all the rest of her 
Demesnes,

and procured the speedy restitution thereof.


§ 20. To return to 
Kishon,
 which somewhat more northward lea∣veth
this Tribe, and entereth into 
Zebulun,
 having first divided it self in∣to
two streames, whereof the easternmost (being the north-boundary
of 
Issachar
) runneth by
 
Tabor,
 a city so called, from the vicinity of the
mountain we formerly described. Hereabouts 
Zeba
 and 
Zalmunna,

made a massacre of many Princelike 
Israelites,
 for which fact 
Gideon
 or∣dered
their execution. And here we take notice of two neighbouring
mountains lovingly agreeing together.



1 
Tabor
 on the north (whereof formerly in

Zebulun
) of so eminent note, that it passed
for a proverbiall expression, of any 
unquesti∣oned
certainty, As
 sure as▪ Tabor is among
the mountains.
 This place was in after ages
much profaned with Idolatry, as appears by
the Prophet
 complaining of the priests, that
they had been 
a net spred upon Tabor.


2 
Hermon,
 hard by on the south of this
Tribe (the top-cliffe whereof is
called 
Hermonium
 as a modern
Traveller doth describe.
 
David

puts them both together, 
The
north and the south thou hast 
reated
them, Tabor and Hermon shall rejoyce
in thy name.




However others understand the Psalmist of another 
Hermon,
 that fa∣mous
mountain formerly described in 
Manasseh
 beyond 
Iordan,
 being
the east-border, as 
Tabor
 was in the heart of the land of 
Canaan;
 meaning
thereby, that, middle, and marches; out-side, and in-side; center, and
circumference; all the whole world must rejoyce in Gods power which
made; and providence, which preserveth them.


§ 21. This east-stream of 
Kishon,
 in modern Maps called 
Kedummim,

runneth to 
Daberah
 in the confines of
 
Zebulun,
 but belongeth to this
Tribe, out of which
 it was assigned a city for the 
Levites.
 Then falleth
it into the sea of 
Cinnereth,
 or 
Tiberias,
 somewhat south of 
Tarichea
 a fa∣mous
city, whereof frequent mention in 
Iosephus,
 but none in Scripture,
to which we chiefly confine our description.


§ 22. The east part of 
Issachar
 is wholly taken up with the mountains


of 
Gilboa,
 where the Armies of the 
Isra
lites,
 and the 
Philistines
 met,
having formerly measured most part of this Tribe, with their mili∣tary
motions. The 
Philistines
 marching first from
 
Shunem
 to
 
A∣phek;

thence to
 
Iezreel,
 (backward and forward to finde an ad∣vantageous
place for fight) thence to mount 
Gilboa,
 where they encoun∣tred,
and conquered the 
Israelites
 in battell. 
Saul
 being here grie∣vously
wounded, desired his Armour-bearer to slay him, who re∣fused
it, as bearing his Armes for the defence, not destruction of
his Master. Hereupon 
Saul
 slew himself, and his Armour-bearer
followed his example. Both which, having since cast up their▪ Au∣dit,
can tell, what is gotten by the prodigall thrift of throwing away
ones life, to prevent the losing thereof. Then a fourfold division
was made of what remained of 
Saul.
 His
 head sent into the land
of the 
Philistines;
 body hung up upon the walls of 
Bethshean;
 Ar∣mour
offered in the Temple of 
Ashtaroth;
 Crown, and bracelets
brought by the 
Amalekite
 to King 
David.
 For though his tongue
spake lies, his hands told truth, presenting the very 
regalia
 of King

Saul.
 Wonder not, that 
Saul
 should weare these ornaments in
battell, where an helmet had been more proper then a Crown;
seeing we read in our English
 Chronicles, that in 
Bosworth
-fight
King 
Richards Crown-ornamentall
 was found among the spoiles in the
field, and then, and there set by the Lord 
Stanley
 on the head of
King 
Henry
 the seventh.


§ 23. 
David,
 on this dysaster of 
Sauls
 death, cursed Mount

Gilboa,
 Let there be no dew or rain upon you.
 But,
 
Brochardus
 travel∣ling
over them 
Anno Dom.
 1283. found, and felt both, be∣ing
well wetted in his journey. What! were 
Davids
 words guilty
of infidelity, seeing it is easier to withhold rain from a mountain,
then to remove it from its foundation, and 
cast it into the sea?
 and
yet our Saviour
 assures us this shall be done, if in faith desired.
But, be it known, 
David
 intended not his curse should take effect,
but meerly to manifest his great grief, and to shew, how far he
was from delighting at the death of his greatest enemy. Better to
fall under 
Davids Dirae,
 as he was a Poet, then as he was a Pro∣phet,
the latter lighting heavily indeed, as
 
Iudas
 in
 
Achitophel

could witness the weight thereof. Nor remaineth any thing more
observable in this Tribe, save in the east part thereof, on 
Ior∣dan

they shew Pilgrims the place where
 
Naaman
 (patient at last by
his servants perswasion) washed seven times, and was cleansed of his
Leprosie.


§ 24. Thus all the remarkable places of 
Issachar,
 but not all
those in 
Issachar,
 are already by us described. For, (as the text

 expresly saith) the Tribe of 
Manasseh had in Issachar, and in Asher,
even three Countries;
 that is, lying in 
Issachar,
 and 
Asher,
 but en∣vironed


round with those Tribes possessions, yet pertaining to the
portion of 
Manasseh.
 Let none blame Divine Providence of ill
Architecture, for not well contriving the rooms in the 
house of
Israel;
 the division of the land by lot, not being well designed,
wherein 
Issachars Chamber
 [his portion] was made a thorough-fare,

Manasseh
 having three closets [three small countreys] within the
same. So that neither Tribe could enjoy his own with privacy,
and intireness; and 
Manasseh
 (if but stepping out of the high-way)
must in a manner trespass on 
Issachar,
 or crave leave of him, to
come, through his, to his own inheritance. But know, all was
ordered by the
 
counsell of Gods will,
 for reasons best known to
himself; who would not have his children 
Churles,
 to ingross ha∣bitations
by themselves; but, by such mixture of their portions, invi∣ted,
yea, ingaged their persons to mutuall intercourse, seeing the
very lots of their Tribes gave loving visits, and their Countreys
(by Gods own appointment) came so curteously, and confident∣ly,
one within another.


§ 25. But very hard it is to conceive,
 how 
Manasseh
 could
have any land within 
Asher,
 which Tribe lay many miles more
northward, and beyond the Tribe of 
Zebulun
 interposed. The
Jewish Rabbins being much perplext at the Pedegree of 
A
zel,

why it is twice reckoned up in
 Chronicles, use to say, that

they
 
need four hundred Camels loaden with Commentaries to give the true
reason thereof.
 But their expression is more appliable to this pre∣sent
difficulty, how 
Manasseh
 could have any ground in 
Asher,

except (as we have presented it in our Map) some part of 
Asher

lay southward at distance, dis-jointed from the main body of
that Tribe, which we have formerly described. Who knows not
that pieces of Parishes, parcells of Manors, portions of Coun∣ties,
though far off dismembred, relate unto them, notwithstanding
the intermediate distance betwixt them?


§ 26. But let not 
Issachar,
 or 
Asher
 repine, that 
Manasseh
 had
so much land in their Countreys, seeing though the right was
assigned unto them, the 
Canaanites
 for a long time (till about

Davids
 reign) kept all the same in their possession, as will appear
by the ensuing parallel.


Joshua 17. 11.
 And Manasseh had in Issachar
and Asher, Bethshean, and her towns,
and Ibleam, and her towns, and the
inhabitants of Dor, and her towns,
and the inhabitants of Endor, and
her towns, and the inhabitants of
Taanch, and her towns, and the
inhabitants, of Meggido and her
towns, even three Countrys.
Judges 1. 27.
 Neither did Manasseh drive out
the inhabitants of Bethshean, and her
towns, nor Taanach, and her towns,
nor the inhabitants of Dor, and her
towns, nor the inhabitants of Ible∣am,
and her towns, nor the inhabi∣tants
of Megiddo, and her towns:
but the Canaanites would dwell in
that land.



Of 
Bethshean
 more conveniently hereafter. By 
Ibleam,
 Ahaziah
 was
wounded, as was formerly observed. 
Dor
 (mentioned for a sea-town
in 
Ptolemy
) had the King thereof conquered
 by 
Ioshua. Endor,
 whither

Sisera's
 souldiers defeated in fight, not far off at
 
Taanach,
 (which also
was
a regall city in the days of
 
Ioshua,
 and afterwards belonged to the Le∣vites)
fled, were pursued,
 
perished and became as the dung of the earth.
 Hi∣ther

Saul
 repaired to a witch, to raise 
Samuel,
 and received cold
comfort from the dead, or Devill rather, informing him of his future
destruction: so that 
Saul,
 formerly sick with fear of the worst,
lived to hear Satan toll his passing-bell in his sad predictions.


§ 27. But
 
Megiddo
 was the most eminent City 
Manasseh
 had in

Issachar.
 The King hereof was destroyed by 
Ioshua,
 and many years
after 
Iosiah
 was slain in the 
vale of Megiddo,
 bidding 
Pharaoh Necho
 bat∣tell,
in his march against 
Charchemish by Euphrates.
 Never Prince shew∣ed
more devotion in his life, or less discretion in his death, court∣ing
that danger which declined him, seeing 
Pharaoh
 desired
 peace∣ably
to depart. But haply 
Iosiah
 conceived himself ingaged to fight
him, in point of



1 Honour; because without leave he had made his land an high
way to pass through it.


2 Policy; suspicious, though 
Pharaoh
 went forth as a friend, he
would returne as a foe, especially if puffed up with success in his
expedition.




But what shall we say? it was the sin of his subjects would not suf∣fer

Iosiah
 to keep quiet at home. Their impieties made him to march,
thrust him into the field, forced him into the fight, yea, shot the fatall
arrow, which wounded him at the heart.


§ 28. Now let none be troubled, because 
Iosiah
 (who rather deser∣ved
two lives) seems to have two deaths,
 one text making him to die

 at 
Megiddo,
 another
 at 
Ierusalem.
 Understand it, death arrested him
with a mortall wound at 
Megiddo,
 but did not imprison him till he
came to 
Ierusalem,
 where he expired. Much less let any challenge God, as
worse then his word with 
Iosiah,
 having promised him by his Prophet

 
to be gathered to his Fathers in peace;
 for besides that that promise princi∣pally
related to the captivity of 
Babylon
 (from which 
Iosiah
 was exemp∣ted)
even such may be said 
to die in peace,
 which swim to their graves in
their own bloud, if withall imbarqued in a good conscience.


§ 29. All 
Israel,
 and principally the Prophet 
Ieremy,
 dropped many
a precious teare on his hearse, whose
 
Lamentations
 are an Elegy on 
Iosiah's

death; yea, their grief was no land-flood of present passion, but a con∣stant
channell of continued sorrow, streaming from an annuall foun∣tain,
it being made an
 
Ordinance
 in 
Israel.
 The Prophet speaking of a
grand, and generall grieving for mens sins,
 compareth it to the mour∣ning
of 
Hadadrimmon
 (conceived to be a place hard by) in the 
valley of
Megiddon.



§ 30. 
Iehosaphat
 the son of 
Paruah
 was 
Solomons
 purvey our in
 
Issachar,

but the dis-jointed piece of 
Manasseh
 in this Tribe pertained partly to

Baanah
 the son of 
Ahilud (to whom belongeth Taanach; Megiddo, and all Beth∣sh
an
) and partly to 
Aminada
 husband to 
Taphath Solomons
 daughter,
purveyour alone in the land of
 
Dor.
 An argument of the great fertility
of that little land, because the 
land of Dor
 alone, was a 
signe
 for a whole
moneth in the 
Zodiack
 of 
Solomons
 yearly provisions. An Asse (formerly
observed) argent, in a field vert, was 
Issachar's
 Arms, 
cou
hing between two

 burdens.
 Some by these understand 
Zebulun,
 and 
Manasseh,
 which boun∣ded

Issachar
 on both sides. But, why was their neighbourhood more
burdensome, then any other Tribes? Such perchance, are
nearer the truth, who expound the 
two burdens, Tri∣bute

and 
Tillage;
 betwixt which, 
Issachar,
 quie∣tly
cocuhed, never medling with wars,
but when forced thereun∣to
in his own
defence.






Here the Map of 
Manasseh
 on this side 
Jordan
 is to be inserted.












THE DESCRIPTION OF MANASSEH on this side IORDAN. CHAP. 8.


§ 1. 
M
Anasseh
 his numbers and worthies have formerly
been described on the east of 
Iordan,
 as also
such Cities as being environed with 
Issachar,
 yet
belonged to this Tribe. It remaineth that we
survey that portion of 
Manasseh
 west of 
Iordan,

lying entire in it self, and having 
Issachar
 on the
north, 
Ephraim
 on the south, the Mediterranean Sea on the west,
and 
Iordan
 on the east thereof, a fruitfull Countrey divided betwixt

 six male-families of the 
Manassites,
 and the five daughters of 
Zelo∣phehad.


§ 2. These were those Virgins, who pleading before
 
Moses,
 got a
right to, before
 
Ioshua
 got possession of their inheritance. Silence
was injoined their Sex in the
 
Church,
 not 
Court,
 where they handled
their own cause so well, it is pity any 
Counsell
 should be 
retained
 for
them. Nor was it the worst part of their Rhetorick, the good Cha∣racter
they gave their dead Father, which might serve for an Epitaph to
be inscribed on his monument.


Here lieth the man, who
 was not in the company of them who gathered them∣selves
together against the Lord in the COMPANY OF KO∣RAH,
but died in his OWN SIN.


Meaning he died a naturall death for his personall offences, and was
no sharer in the guilt of 
Rebellion
 against God in 
Moses.
 This instance of

Zelophehad
 his 
coheirs,
 let Lawyers judge how justly it is alledged of some
against their practise, who by 
entailes on the Heire male,
 dam up inheri∣tances
from running in that 
generall
 channell into which God and nature
hath derived them.



§ 3. In the west of this Tribe on the sea,
 we meet with 
Cesarea Stra∣tonis,

built and beautified (with a fair haven called 
Drusus
) by 
Herod

the great in the honour of 
Augustus Cesar.
 Amongst other edifices there∣in,

 
Herods judgement hall
 by him built was a most remarkable structure.
Indeed all 
Cesarea
 might be termed 
Gods judgement hall,
 from an exem∣plary
piece of justice here executed on 
Herod Antipas.
 Who coming hi∣ther
from 
Ierusalem
 clad with gorgeous raiment, (and the guilt of Saint

 
Iames
 his bloud) made an eloquent oration, more gaudy then his ap∣parell,
unto the people, who cryed out in approbation thereof, 
The voice of
a God, and not of a man:
 here 
Herod
 in stead of rejoining 
The voice of lying flat∣terers,
and not of sober men;
 in stead of reclaiming what they exclaimed, im∣braced
and hug'd their praises as proper to himself, and thereupon
an
 Angell and worms, the best and basest of creatures, met in
his punishment, the one smiting, the other eating him up: and no
wonder if 
Worms
 quickly devoured him, whom those 
flesh-flies
 had

blown up
 before. If any aske, seeing the people were equally guilty
in that their sacrilegious expression, (yea they were the 
theeves, He∣rod

but the 
receiver
) why fell not the pun
shment also on the whole
multitude? It is answered, First, because they were the 
whole multitude;

and God in such cases mercifully singles out some singall offenders for
punishment to save but fright the rest. Secondly, more discretion was
expected from a Prince, then from a rabble of people. Lastly, what
in them was but a blasphemous complement, was by 
Herods
 accep∣tance
thereof made in him a reality, usurped by him as due to his
deserts.


§ 4. But leaving profane 
Herod,
 many pious people lived in

Cesarea,
 as
 
Cornelius
 the Centurion, the first fruits of the Gentiles;

 
Agabus
 the Prophet, foretelling Saint 
Pauls
 bonds and Martyr∣dome;
and 
Philip
 the Evangelist, famous for his four daughters

Virgins-prophetesses. This I firmely beleeve, whilest my faith de∣murres
at what I read of 
Brechin
 a Lord in
 
Wales,
 who had four
and twenty daughters 
all Saints
 begotten of his own body.


§ 5. Here Saint 
Paul
 eloquently defended his innocence,
 against
the salable tongue of 
Tertullus,
 and afterwards 
reasoned of righteousness,
temperance
 and judgement,
 before 
Felix
 the corrupt, vicious and debauched
Deputy of 
Iudea,
 till 
Felix,
 (his foundred feet feeling the Pincers) began
to winch and to prefer Saint 
Pauls
 room before his company. In the
same place the Apostle pleaded for himself before 
Festus, Agrippa
 and 
Ber∣nice

his
 incestuous 
wife-sister,
 entering into the place of hearing,


, with 
much fancifulness,
 or 
great pompe.
 Perchance this

Bernice
 ware then about her, that eminent Gem, whereof the Heathen
Poet

took especiall notice.




—deinde adamas notissimus, & Berenices


In digito factus preciosior; hunc dedit olim


Barbarus, incestae dedit hunc Agrippa sorori.






And
 the fam'd diamond the richer show'd


On Berenices fingers, this bestow'd


The barbarous Agrippa, he to his


Incestuous sister once presented this.





But be 
Bernice
 never so brave, the
 
bonds
 of Saint 
Paul,
 (worn by
him then in 
Cesarea
) were in the Judgement of God, and all good men
the most glorious ornament.


§ 6. South of 
Cesarea
 stood 
Antipatris,
 named in the honour of 
Anti∣pater

father to 
Herod the great.
 Hi
her Saint 
Paul
 came guarded in state
by night with more then
 five hundred souldiers, and hence the foot∣men
were sent back to 
Ierusalem
 whilest the seventy horse advanced
forward with him to 
Cesarea.
 South of 
Antipatris
 the river
 
Kanah

(which divideth this Tribe from 
Ephraim
) runneth into the sea, so
called from reeds 
KANAH
 in Hebrew, (whence our English

Canes
 or walking-staves fetch in both the 
name
 and 
thing
 from the east
Countreys) growing plentifully thereabouts, and many Maps pre∣sent
us with a 
valley of Reeds
 in this place. Say not this debaseth the
land, that so course a commodity should take up a whole valley there∣in,
(for besides as 
London
 water-men will tell you, an acre of reeds
on the bank side is as beneficiall as one of wheat) these 
Canes
 were
to make arrowes and staves, yea some to make Sugars thereof: an

 eye-witness affirming that plenty of sugar-canes grow in 
Palestine

at this day. Surely formerly growing there, (though little known
to▪ and less used by the ancients) seeing that Countrey hath gained
no new plants, but rather lost much fertility it had before.


§ 7. Sugar (pardon a digression) was anciently less used,
 either
because their masculine palats were not so liquorish as ours now
adays; or because they preferred honey, plenty whereof was extract∣ed
and refined to their hand. Yea our modern Sugar, as it is boiled and
baked, is not above two hundred years old; and the art of refining
it was found out long since by a
 
Venetian,
 getting above an hun∣dred
thousand crowns thereby, leaving them to his son afterward made
a Knight, who wasted all to nothing.


§ 8. In the north of this Tribe lies the vale of 
Iesreel
 and Well
of 
Herod,
 where 
Gedeon
 conquered the 
Midianites
 
ncamping by the
hill of 
Moreh.
 Indeed the achievements of 
Gedeon
 take up almost this
whole half-tribe, and therefore we will attend on him from his

call
 to be a Judge unto his summons to his Grave.


§ 9. Sad in his time was the condition of the 
Israelites,

oppressed
by the 
Midianites,
 who swarmed
 
like Grass-hoppers,
 for number and
noisomeness, over the land of 
Canaan: Grass-hoppers
 were formerly a

Plague
 for 
Egypt,
 but now for 
Israel,
 these
 
Midianites
 devouring all
which the other had sowen. Time was, when the 
Israelites reaped the
fields they did not sow,
 whereas now they sowed what they did not reap.
See what wofull inversions sin can make. In this dolefull estate the
Angell found 
Israel,
 when he sat under
 an oake in 
Ophrah
 in the east
of this Tribe neare 
Iordan,
 and saluted 
Gedeon
 threshing by the wine∣press,

The Lord is with thee, thou valiant man.
 Much concealed valour may


lurk under a plain & painful outside, whcih a just occasion may produce
into publick view. Yet let none turn their 
flailes, aker-staves, sheep-hooks,
shuttles, needles,
 into 
swords,
 till first with 
Gedeon
 they have a warrant from
God for the same. 
Gedeon
 having thus a cal from God, and confirmed with
many miracles, first by night cast down the Altar (erecting one to God in
the same place) and cut down the grove of 
Baal,
 then gathered an army of
thirty two thousand therewithall to fight the 
Midianites.


§ 10. But his army must be 
garbled,
 as too great for God to give
victory thereby: all the fearfull return home by
 
Proclamation,
 leaving
the Perons, not the Men in the army, fewer for their departure. The
good liquor was no less for the loss of such froath, though two and
twenty thousand then went away. Yea the body of his men remain∣ing,
was still too big, and must pass another 
decoction.
 Their valour,
hardiness and industry must be tried by a 
Purgatory of water,
 and those
onely were admitted to march on, (proving but three hundred)
who 
bowed not down on their knees,
 in a lazy posture, (as if they meant
to 
make a set meal
 in drinking) but loath to lose so much time,

 
doglike lapped water out of their hands,
 (their dishes, as their tongues,
were their spoons,) manifesting thereby, 
(quick at meat, quick at work
)
the activity of their spirits, taking all refreshing, only 
in passage
 to their
farther imployment.


§ 11. With these three hundred 
Gedeon
 advanceth against the 
Midi∣anites,

and (as formerly by the deeds of his friends) is now confir∣med
afresh with the dreams of his foes, and their own
 interpre∣tation
thereof. Strange that God should condescend so much, and so
often for 
Gedeons
 satisfaction, working miracles 
backward and forward

for his sake: 
fleece only wet,
 and 
ground dry,
 fleece onely dry,
 and 
ground wet.
 Heavens reall miracles, will endure turning, being 
lining,
 and

facing,
 inside and outside both alike. Yea after these and other confir∣mations,
God the night before the battell gave 
Gedeon
 a new sign out
of his enemies own mouth. He that spurneth at the presumptuous,
how low will he stoop to take up a 
weake
 but 
true
 faith! Thus the wise
mother beateth the sound and froward, but bemoaneth and cherish∣eth
her sick and froward child.


§ 12. The 
Midianites
 lay secure in their tents when the word was
given,
 
The sword of God and Gedeon.
 Excellent mixture, both joined to∣gether;
admirable method God put in the first place; Where divine
blessing leads up the 
Van,
 and mans valour brings up the 
battell,
 must not
victory needs follow in the rear? 
Gedeons
 men by order from him brake
their lamp-lined pitchers, whereby night is turned into light, silence
becomes a loud sound in an instant. We have 
this treasure in earthen vessels,

and what miracles may the light of Gods word in the pitchers of poor
preachers bring to pass?


§ 13. The sodain shining and sounding fills the eyes and eares of


the 
Midianites
 with amazement. Whence came these spirits walking
in the dark, dropt from heaven, or raised from the earth? The text
was terrible, but oh what dis
all descants did their affrighted fancies
make thereon? Every mans fear, single in it selfe, was doubled by re∣flexion
from his next neighbour. For, hearing so many Trumpets, to∣gether,
if so many Trumpeters, then how many souldiers in proportion
unto them? Hereupon 
the host ran,
 and cryed, and fled to Bethshittah in
Zererah, and to the borders of Abel-meholah, unto Tabbath.
 Thus, great Ar∣mies,
once struck with amazement, are like wounded whales, give
them but line enough, and the fishes will be the fishermen to catch
themselves, and beat themselves 
ame by their own violence.


§ 14. Hereafter let none term 
Gideon
 (as 
Ulysses
 is disgracefully cal∣led)

Nocturne miles,
 the 
night Knight,
 because he conversed with the Angel,
cast down 
Baals Altar,
 conquered the 
Midianites,
 all by night; seeing
now in open light he pursued his conquest, chasing 
Zebah
 and 
Zalmunna

with the rest of their Army, home to their own Countrey, where he
overtook and destroied them. Mean time the 
Ephraimites
 were active in
stopping the passages on 
Iordan,
 and slew 
Oreb
 and 
Zeeb,
 the one at a

rock,
 the other at a
 
wine-press,
 first coloured with their bloud, then cal∣led
after their names to all posterity.


§ 15. What remains of 
Gideon,
 I would willingly conceal, that his
Sun might not set in a cloud. But, man must not smother, what God
will have seen, especially because tending to his honour, our instructi∣on,
though 
Gideons
 disgrace. Who, refusing a Crown, accepted the ear∣rings
of the people, and thereof made an
 
Ephod:
 surely onely as a civill
memoriall of his valour, and their thankfulness. But, what had

Gideon
 a 
Manassite,
 to doe with an 
Ephod,
 a 
Leviticall
 vestment? Such a
monument was neither of divine 
institution,
 or 
benediction,
 and therefore
through mans corruption, easily subject to be abused to superstition. If

Gideon
 walks but on the brink, the next generation will fall to the bot∣tome
of Idolatry, as here it came to pass. Posterity went a
 
whoring
 after
this 
Ephod,
 which caused the massacre in, and destruction of the f
mily
of 
Gideon,
 whom we leave buried in 
Ophrah
 in the
 grave of his father

Ioash,
 and so proceed.


§ 16. And now his history finished,
 we shall soon dispatch the re∣mainder
of this half Tribe. First we resume 
Abel-meholah
 (lately menti∣oned)
which was the habitation in after ages of 
Elisha.
 Here he was
plowing 
with twelve
 yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth.
 What
in severall teames, or all in the same, to draw one plough? The latter is
most likely, whilest our English husbandmen will not wonder at such
an herd of oxen, (twenty four) haling at one plough, when they shall
read, that the 
Vale of Iordan
 (wherein lay 
Abel-meholah
) is noted for
 
clay
ground,
 and therefore such stiffe land, (especially at the 
first tilth
 thereof)
must needs require a great strength thereunto. But had his oxen been as


many more 
Elisha
 would willingly have left them, when 
Eliah
 his
man
le was once cast upon him. 
Mo
le,
 which could, stop rivers
in the full speed of their
 course, and therefore might stay a man in the
height of his calling. Hereby we perceive that the words of our Savi∣our,

No
 
an having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the
kingdome of God,
 are not literally, but spiritu
lly, to be expounded, of
such as having well begun, apostate from their religious Resoluti∣ons.


§ 17. In the aforesaid vale of 
Iordan
 lay 
Zarthan,
 betwixt which and

S
ccoth
 (on the other side of 
Iordan
 in the Tribe of 
Gad
) the two brazen
pillars, 
(Iachin,
 and 
Boaz
) with all the vessels of the Temple, were made
by 
Hiram,
 of 
bright brass,
 in the 
clay
 
ground,
 which probable served him for

moldes
 to run the melted metall therein. And somewhat more towards
the north, lay 
Aenon
 near to 
Salim,
 where 
Iohn
 was baptizing, 
because there
was much
 water there.
 Here his Disciples complained to 
Iohn,
 concern∣ing
Jesus eclipsing him with his lustre. 
Iohn
 truly stated the controver∣sie,
and modestly determined it against himself, how he 
must decrease,
whilest Christ must increase.


§ 18. As these places lay on the east of this Tribe,
 in the 
vale of Iordan.

so in the western part thereof in the 
vale of Iezreel,
 lay
 
Gath-Rimmon
 (in
Chronicles called
 
Bileam
) the sole City which the 
Levites
 had in this
entire part of the Tribe of 
Manasseh;
 seeing 
Taanach
 (called 
Anar
 in
Chronicles) lay (as is aforesaid) in that part of 
Manasseh
 which was
surrounded with 
Issachar.
 The land of 
Tappuah
 belonged also to this
half Tribe, though 
Tappuah
 the City pertained to 
Ephraim.
 Thus the
town, and late Castle of 
Belvoir
 stands in 
Lincolne
-shire, though the
vale thence denominated lies in three shires round about it.


§ 19. Amongst the mountains in 
Manasseh,
 we take especiall notice
of 
Gilead
 (so called from 
Gilead
 the grand son of 
Manasseh
)
 whence 
Gi∣deon's

cowards departed; the hill 
Moreh,
 nigh which the 
Midtanitish

Army was incamped; and above all the mountain of 
Obadiah,
 so called
because therein in two caves he hid an
 hundred Prophets, so close,
that neither foes nor friends knew thereof, neither 
Iezebel
 nor 
Elijah
 get∣ting
intelligence of their being there, the latter erroneously conceiving
himself alone left of all the Prophets in the land. Their bill of fare was
bread and water, pretious liquour when it had not rained in 
Israel
 for
three years and an half; hereto our Saviour reflected, that none should
lose his reward that gave his little ones 
a cup of cold water,
 yea, that such
who received a Prophet, should receive a 
Prophets
 reward,
 as here it
came to pass. For the sparkes of his 
guests
 spirit catched hold on 
Obadiah

their 
host,
 so far inflaming his breast with inspiration that the short pro∣phecy
bearing his name, is by learned men referred to him, as the Au∣thor
thereof. Saint
 
Hierome
 tells us, that the Lady 
Paula
 (as weak as
she was) climbed up this mountain, to behold those monimental caves
therein.



§ 20. In this land we also meet with the woody hils of the 
Perizzites,

and of the 
Rephaims,
 or 
Giants,
 mingled amongst them, much affright
ng
the 
Manassites
 with their 
Iron chariots.
 Not as if all made of massie iron▪
(such would have been slugs in fight, and so heavy, that they needed
horses of steel for strength to draw them) but that they were plated and
armed with iron hooks, mischievous instruments of execution, especi∣ally
in the pursuit of a broken army, men being as grass whereof whole
swathes were mowed down with these crooked sithes in chasing a
routed enemy. Enough almost to make one suspect our ancient 
Britones

akin to these 
Canaanites,
 seeing such chariots were so fashionable in their

 fights; were it not that we finde the like
 
,
frequently used in all eastern Countries. However 
Ioshua
 gave the 
Ma∣nassites

both a promise and prophecy, that (notwithstanding those 
Iron∣moving
forts
 of the 
Canaanites
) they should in process of time certainly
overcome them.


§ 21. We must not forget 
Beths
n
 belonging to 
M
nasseh
 (but
 seated
and invironed with 
Issach
r
) whence for a long time they could not ex∣pell
the 
Canaanites,
 therefore called it 
Bethsan,
 that is, 
the house of an Enemy.

Here the bodies of 
Saul
 and 
Ionathan
 were hung up by the
 
Philistines
Bethsan
 was afterwards called 
Nysa
 by
 humane writers (and at last

Scythopolis
) from 
Nysa Bacchus
 his nurse, whom he is said there solemnly
to have buried. A jolly dame no doubt, as appears by the well battling
of the plump boy her nursery. But seeing wine was 
Bacchus
 his milk
when a child, meat when a man, food when well, physick when sick,
we may justly conceive the history mythologically true, the burying of

Bacchus
 his nurse in this place plainly importing plenty of the best wines
in the Countrey hereabouts.


§ 22. As for 
Bezek
 I name it last of all▪ because ambiguously placed in
the confines of 
Manasseh,
 and 
Ephraim,
 different from a City of the same
name, nearer
 
Ierusalem,
 where the Tyrant 
Adonibezek
 lived. In this 
Be∣zek

 saul
 numbred the 
Israelites
 (being three hundred and thirty thou∣sand)
and thence marched to the relieving of 
L
besh-Gilead
 from the

Ammonites.
 The Armes of 
Manasseh
 have been formerly blazoned, and
expounded in our Description of the half Tribe beyond 
Iordan,
 and in
the 
Solomons
 Purveyourships this land, with some of 
Zebulun,
 fell under
the care of 
Baanah
 the Son of 
Ahilud.








Here the Map of the Land of 
Ephraim
 is to be inserted.













THE TRIBE OF EPHRAIM. CHAP. 9.


§ 1. 
E
Phraim
 the younger Son of 
Ios
ph
 was blest by his
grandfather 
Iacob,
 laying
 his right hand on his head
(the print of whose fingers remained visible in the
happiness of 
Ephraims
 posterity) that behinde 
Manasseh

in age, he should prove before him in honour; which
came to pass accordingly. Such was his increase in 
Egypt
 that they a∣mounted
to forty
 thousand five hundred men, all whose carkasses fell
in the wilderness, and a new generation of thirty two
 thousand five
hundred entred the land of Promise.


§. 2. A Princely and puissant Tribe. 
Ephraim
 (saith 
David) is the strength
of
 my head,
 and is often put by a honorable Synecdoche for all the 
ten
Tribes
 or whole
 
Kingdome of Israel.
 The people thereof were active, vali∣ant,
ambitious of honour, but withall hasty, humorous, hard to be plea∣sed,
forward enough to fight with their foes, and too forward to fall out
with their friends, counting other mens 
honour
 to be their 
injury,
 except
they might be admitted 
joint purchasers
 with them in all gallant underta∣kings.
This caused their contest, first with
 
Gideon,
 who pacified them
with his compliance, & afterwards with 
Iephthah,
 where their Braul was
hightned into a Battell, (how quickly doe hot spirits hatch words into
blowes!) of which we have
 spoked before.


§ 3. This Tribe was subject to a naturall imperfection of 
lisping,
 the
cause whereof we leave to others to dispute, whether got by imitation, or
some heredit
y defect in their tongue, or proceeding from some secret
quality in their soil, as it is observed in a village at 
Charleton
 in
 
Leicester∣shire,

that the people therein are troubled with wharling in their utter∣ance.
The best is, men must answer to God for their vitious habits, not
naturall impediments, and better it is to lispe the 
language of Canaan;
 then
plainly to pronounce the 
speech of Ashdod.


§ 4. Sure I am,
 no Tribe, 
Iudah
 excepted, can vie eminent persons with

Ephraim,
 as 
Deborah
 and 
Abdon,
 both Judges of 
Israel,
 the one by he
 ha∣bitation
whilest living, the other by his
 sepulcher when dead, truly col∣lected


to be of this Tribe, as also
 
Ieroboam
 and all the Kings of 
Israel




§ 5. 
 
Dan
 on the south,

 But as for the parti∣cular

 and flexures 
 borders of this Tribe, they are so
many, and so small, they will be scattered out of our memories, except
bound together as, we finde them in the text.


§ 6. Condemn not this our diligence for needless curiosity,
 but know,
that every meer-stone that standeth for a land-mark, though in substance
but a hard flint, or plain pibble, is a precious stone in virtue, and is cor∣diall
against dangerous controversies between party and party, and
therefore it is of great consequence to be well skilled in the out-limits
and boundaries of this, or any other considerable 
.


§ 7. The particular bounds therefore of this Tribe 
 exactly
as followeth.

We reserve the satisfying of such difficulties as in
umber these borders, to
our fifth 
nd last book, intending it shall serve our four former in the
same office wherein the 
Spleen
 attendeth on the 
Liver.
 For, as that is the
drain or sewer of the feculent and melancholy bloud: so we design our
last book of objections for the Repository of all hard doubts and diffi∣culties,
that the rest of our work may be more cheerfull and pleasant in
the reading thereof.


§ 8. Amongst these limitary towns,
 besides the 
B
th-horons,
 both of
them with 
Uzzen-Sherah,
 founded by 
Sherah
 the daughter of 
Ephraim
 the
younger (the greatest 
Buildress
 in the whole Bible) 
Gezer
 is most remar∣kable.
The King 
 was 
 by 
Ioshu
,
 and the City was gi∣ven
to the 
Levites,
 but kept by the 
Canaanites
 in defiance of all the powers
of
 
Ephraim,
 untill 
Pharaoh
 taking it, burning it, and killing the 
Cana∣anites

therein gave it for a
 present to his daughter 
Solomons
 wife. Behold
here two titles on foot at once, and the question is which should take
effect. Whether the title of the 
Levites
 deriving it from Gods
 grant,
though (a main matter) they never had the possession of 
Gezer
 given
them, or that of 
Pharaohs
 daughter claiming it as a donative from her fa∣ther.
The best is, the cause was to be tried before the wisdome and inte∣grity
of 
Solomon,
 who no doubt, being so bountifull to the Temple, would


not be injurious to the Ministers thereof, but that as he gave the child
to the true mother, he would ad
udge the City to the originall owners
thereof, though making his Queen some reparation otherwise. Proceed
we now to the description of this Tribe, and will begin with two emi∣nent
Cities in the south part thereof.


§ 9. 
Rama,

otherwise
 
Ramathaim-Zophim
 (because consisting of two
towns, and seated in the land of
 
Zuph
) was the place, where 
Samuel

was
 born wonderfully, of a long barren mother,
 lived unblamably, (as
appears by the
 nationall testimony of his integrity) died peaceably, and
was
 buried honorably. 
Naioth
 nere 
Rama
 was the name of his house,
where 
David
 sometime conversed with 
Samuel,
 two eminent Prophets
then living together under the same roof.


§ 10. Yea,
 the very aire of this place seems propheticall, seeing 
Saul

coming hither to attach 
David,
 was by the 
great well that is in S
chu
 (the

Helicon
 of heavenly raptures) strangely inspired, and stripping himself,
fell a
 prophecying a day and a night together.


§ 11. This 
Saul
 continued constantly a 
carnall man,
 though we meet
with many spirits, which successively possessed, and deserted him,
1. 
The spirit of prophecy,
 which
 twice ravished, then finally forsook him.
2. 
The Spirit of the Lord,
 fitting him for 
government,
 which
 depar∣ted
from him after 
David
 was anointed. 3. 
An
 evill spirit
 which trou∣bled
him, partly allayed by 
Davids
 musick. 4. 
His vitall and animall Spi∣rits,

which partially forsook him at the witches sad news, when he 
fell
all along on the earth, and there was no
 strength in him. 5. His spirit,
 or soul,
finally forced from him by his own sword on mount 
Gilboa.
 What need
then have men to 
try the
 Spirits
 before they trust them, seeing so many
of them may be in one and the same person?


§ 12. In the new Testament this 
Rama
 is called 
Arimathe
,
 whereof
was
 
Ioseph
 that honourable counseller, who so freely resigned his own
sepulcher to the body of our Saviour, and with 
Nicodemus
 provided for
the decent interring thereof.


§ 13. 
Shiloh
 succeeds (in a narrow southern spong of this Tribe)
where after the conquering of 
Canaan,
 the Tabernacle was solemnly set
up, and remained there almost four hundred years. This place was for
that purpose preferred before others, partly because almost the center of
the land, and partly in honourable respect to
 
Ioshua,
 extracted from, and
living in this Tribe of 
Ephraim;
 and pity it was that God and the Prince
should be parted. Perchance the allusion of 
Shiloh
 with
 
Shiloah,
 or
 
Si∣loam,
(which is by interpretation sent,
 clearly pointing at our Saviour) might
promote this place for the erection of the Tabernacle therein.


§ 14. At 
Shiloh
 there was an anniversary dancing of the daughters
thereof (probably collected out of all 
Israel
 coming then to the Taberna∣cle)
where the 
Benjamites
 as yet unprovided for wives,
 lying in ambush
in the vineyards, violently
 seised some of those maides for their brides,


(happy man be his dole) making strange matches, if each interest
concerned therein be seriously considered.


§ 15. First for the Fathers of these virgins.
 Did this equivocating ex∣pedient
satisfie their consciences, who had formerly
 sworn not to give
their daughters to the 
Benjamites
 to wife, and yet now by laying the de∣sign

 themselves did in effect 
give these women in marriage to these men?


§ 16. Secondly,
 for the young men. What assurance had they, they
could love, not choosing the fittest whom they liked of, but catching the
first they lighted on? Or that they could be beloved, storming their wives
with violence, in stead of taking their affections by mutual composition?


§ 17. As for these 
Brides of fortune,
 may we not presume that many of
them which danced this day, wept on the morrow? Yet one thing might
comfort them, they were all richly married to mighty matches of landed
men, seeing the fair and fruitfull Tribe of 
Benjamin,
 with all the Cities
therein was to be shared amongst their six hundred husbands alone, as
the sole survivers and absolute heires of the whole Countrey.


§ 18. In 
Shiloh Eli
 lived Priest,
 and Judge of 
Israel,
 whither 
Elkanah
 and

Hannah, Samuels
 parents, repaired to Gods publick worship. This 
Hannah

though silent
 when twi
ted by 
Peninnah
 for barrenness, found her
tongue when here
 taxed by 
Eli
 of drunkenness: because a meer sufferer
in the former, but in the latter a sinner, had the accusation been true. 
Sa∣muel

(here prayed for) afterward here served God in a linen Ephod, and
though generally there was a
 
dearth of visions
 in this age, here he had
many revealed unto him. But 
Eli's
 dim eies connived here at his sons im∣pieties.
Whose servant with his
 
Trident
 (an Innovation, no doubt, and
none of the utensils made by 
Moses according to the pattern of the mount
) would
have raw flesh for his Master; so that, what between the 
raw flesh
 here sa∣crilegiously
stolne, and the 
strange flesh
 wherewith those Priests
 abused
themselves 
at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation,
 any pious eares
would now
 
tingle
 to hear their faults, as hereafter at their punishment.


§ 19. For soon after happned the destruction of 
Hophni
 and 
Phinehas,

(slain in battell) the Arkes captivity, 
Eli's
 heart-breaking with the news,
neck-breaking with his fall, the death of 
Phinehas
 his wife newly delive∣red,
whose son got the sad name (not of 
Benoni,
 a name calculated for pri∣vate
pangs, but) of
 
Ichabod
 from this sorrowfull accident, because born
in this 
grand eclipse
 when the glory was departed from 
Israel.


§ 20. Yea the very city of 
Shiloh
 it self,
 may seem in some sort to expire
on the same occasion, which, as it owed its life and lustre to the Taber∣nacles
residence therein, so sinks down in silence at the captivity thereof.
For we finde no after mention of any eminent act therein, onely that 
A∣hijah

the Prophet long after lived
 there. He was the Jewish 
Tiresias,

though blinde, a 
Seer,
 who discerning 
Ieroboams
 wife through her disguise,
foretold the death of her sick son 
Abijah.
 So much of 
Shiloh;
 proceed we
now to the more northern and mountainous part of this Tribe.



§ 21. Amongst the remarkable places in mount 
Ephraim,
 we find 
Timnath
Serah,
 or 
Timnath
 Heres
 (by inversion of the letters) on the northside of
the 
hill Gaash,
 where
 
when they had made an end of dividing the land,
 the children
of 
Israel
 gave an inheritance to 
Ioshua.
 See here his publick spirit, not im∣proving
his power, though 
Comānder in chief,
 to pickout the fattest pastures,
fairest meadows, fertilest fields for himselfe, but (as if he counted it
possession enough for him to have gained possessions for others) when
the meanest man was first served, he was contented to stand to the peo∣ples
courtesie, what they would bestow upon him. If it sound to the
praise of a Generalls valour, to come last out of the field when it is
won, no less is the commendation of his temperance to come last into
it when it is divided. In 
Timnath Serah,
 asked and built by him, 
Ioshua

afterwards was
 buried; and as Saint 
Hierome
 reports that in his time
the 
Sun
 was depicted on his monument. This I dare boldly say, that
whereas modern Heralds blazon armes by the specious titles of 
Planets,

their fancy is with most truth appliable to 
Ioshua's
 shield, 
bearing Sol and
Luna
 indeed, having made both 
Sun and Moon
 stand still by his pr
yers.
Also 
Eleazar
 the High priest was
 buried in mount 
Ephraim,
 in an hill
which pertained to 
Phinehas
 his son.


§ 22. 
Tirzah
 was another city near mount 
Eph
aim,
 whose King was
conquered by
 
Ioshua.
 In the days of 
Solomon
 it was a place of great re∣pute,

Thou art beautifull, ô my Love, as
 Tirzah; comely as Ierusalem, terrible
as an army with banners. Ieroboam
 chose it to be his
 Royall-seat (per∣chance
because near
 
Zereda
 his native place) where he and his succes∣sours
lived for welnigh sixty years. Indeed 
Baasha
 had a project to make

Ramah
 the place of his residence, as nearer to 
Ierusalem,
 and therefore
more convenient to mark the motions of the Kings of 
Iudah;
 but fru∣strated
of his designe he was fain to
 return to 
Tirzah,
 reigned and
was buried here. 
Elah, Baasha's
 son, was here drinking in the house of

Azzah
 his steward, when a dear reckoning was brought in, and no
less then his life extorted from him by 
Zimri
 his successour. Afterwards,
when 
Tirzah
 was taken, 
Zimri
 either out of envy that the royall Palace
should survive him, or desire to prevent a more shamefull death, burnt
himself, and the Kings house together. We read of King 
Asa,
 that after
his death, 
his subjects made a very great
 burning for him;
 but 
Zimri
 exceeded,
making a 
bone-fire
 for and of himself when alive; herein standing alone,
except seconded by
 
Sardanapalus,
 who in like manner destroyed him∣self
on the same occasion. Thus dyed 
Zimri,
 a King onely for a week,
whose Reign like a winters day was 
short and dirty;
 yet long enough to
leave this taunt for 
Iezebels
 mouth,
 and Proverb to posterity, 
Had Zimri
peace, that slew his Master?
 Hard by is
 
Tiphsaph,
 where King 
Menahem

barbarously ripped up the women with child, because the city opened
not to receive him.


§ 23. Besides cities, many private dwellings were sprinkled on


mount 
Ephraim;
 as the house of that
 
Levite,
 whose concubine the men
of 
Gibeah
 abused to death: the house of 
Micah,
 well stored with Idols,
where first the five spies, then the sixe hundred men of 
Dan,
 took up their
lodgings, when marching to 
Laish:
 Ungratefull guests! who in stead of
discharging their quarters, plundered their
 Land-lord, taking his Images
and priest away with them. Thirdly, the house of 
Deborah
 under a

 Palme-tree betwixt 
Ramah
 and 
Bethel,
 where she judged 
Israel.
 A tree
then the 
Westminster Hall
 of the whole Land, made the seat of justice in an
open place, partly that all people might have free access with their Petiti∣ons
thereunto, without doors or porters to exclude any; partly that
so publick a place might minde Judges, parties, and witnesses of fair
and clear proceeding without secret or sinister reservations, having hea∣ven
Gods Throne in view, and before their eyes. This Palme was pre∣ferred
for this purpose before other trees, because far and fair spreading,
it afforded much people a shady conveniency under the branches there∣of;
not to insist on (a text rather for fancy to descant, then judgement
to comment on) the resemblances betwixt the growth of Palmes and
judiciall proceedings. Which, as that plant improves it self by pressures,
ought in fine to flourish in defiance of all opposition.


§ 24. But the most
 observable place in the north of this Tribe is
the City of 
Samaria,
 built by 
Omri,
 (because the royall Palace was burnt at

Tirzah,
 as is aforesaid) on an hill bought by him for two talents of silver,
and called by him 
Samaria,
 from
 
Shemer
 the former owner of that place.
Strange, it should take the denomination rather from him that sold it,
then him that bought it: except this was part of the bargain, which ap∣pears
not in Scripture. Sure we are, though the name of 
Omri
 was not pre∣served
in the place, the 
Statutes of Omri
 were observed by the people, accord∣ing
to the
 Prophets complaint, and his impious injunctions obliged
men to the practise thereof. 
Samaria
 proved afterwards a beautifull City,
& was the principal place of the residence & burial of the Kings of 
Israel.


§ 25. Stately was the Kings Palace therein.
 Hence King 
Ahaziah
Ahabs
 son had a mortall fall through a lattice in his upper
 chamber:
possible this mischance had been prevented, had the house or chamber
been built according to Gods direction,
 
with batlements, that men might not
fall from thence.
 But likely it is, the Fabrick thereof was fashioned ac∣cording
to the 
Mode
 of the 
Sidonian
 architecture. Hard by 
Ahab
 built an

 
Ivory-house.
 Conceive it chequered, inlaid, and adorned therewith;
otherwise all the Elephants in 
India
 and 
Affrick
 would not afford mate∣rialls
for such a structure: not to say, the crookedness and smalness of
their teeth, made them useless for beames in that building. A frequent
Synecdoche, to denominate the house from the principall materialls
therein, like 
Leaden-hall
 in 
London;
 not because wholly built, but onely
covered with that metall. But alass, what good would an 
Ivory-house
 do

Ahab,
 whilest he had an 
Ebony soul
 in the midst thereof, blacked over with


impieties. 
Baals temple
 built by 
Ahab,
 and turned by
 
Iehu
 into a

Iakes,
 was a structure of great State, into which 
Baals
 Priests were
trained by a device, and slain. The greatest place of receipt in 
Samaria

(which might serve them for a market-stead, or rather for a seat of
Justice) was that 
voide
 
place at the entring of the gate;
 of such a latitude,
that it was able to receive at once the 
Kings
 of 
Israel
 and 
Iudah,
 with their
royall retinue.


§ 26. But amongst all the structures in 
Samaria,
 none more eminent
then the streets built therein by the King of 
Syria.
 A thing scarce to be
paralleled, that a forein King should be permitted to erect streets in the
Metropolitan City of another Kingdome. If any alledge that 
Peter Earl
of Savoy
 built his palace in the Strand (known by the name of 
Savoy
 at
this day) and that there is a street betwixt 
Aldersgate
 and 
Smithfield
 called

Britons street,
 from the ancient lodgings of the 
Duke of Britain
 therein;
neither of the instances amount to the matter in hand. The former pa∣lace
being erected, as I take it, for the Earles abode here when in banish∣ment.
And as for the latter, it appears not that the 
Dukes of Britain
 were
at any cost in building it: whereas the Kings of 
Syria
 founded the Fa∣brickes
of those streets in the city of 
Samaria,
 and never inhabited therein.
It seems when 
Omri
 began the new building of 
Samaria,
 either he request∣ed
the assistance of the King of 
Syria
 (as a neighbouring Prince in amity
with him) to help him in the work; (no shame to beg the first clouts of
friends, for an infant-city) or else the 
Syrian
 Kings civilly tendered their
service, to give it as good handsell to so good a work, or as a 
Royall Largess

amongst the inferiour builders thereof. For mine own part I conceive
that the Kings of 
Damascus,
 got some conquest of 
Samaria
 not mentioned
in Scripture, and then built these streets, as a monument of their victory
and bridle to over-awe the city. The rather because 
Benhadad
 being af∣terwards
overcome by 
Ahab
 profered the like favour and freedome unto
him, if it pleased him to accept thereof,
 
And thou shalt make streets for thee in
Damascus, as my Father made in Samaria.


§ 27. We meet in Scripture with three famous sieges of 
Samaria.

Once when 
Benhadad
 not content with 
Ahabs
 submission, (profering
to hold all he had by homage from him) would have all the wealth of
the city 
in specie
 surrendered unto him, vainly vaunting that
 
the dust of
Samaria could not suffice for handfulls for all the people that followed him.
 Surely
the Scavengers were very diligent in sweeping so populous a place, or
else it was a most hyperbolicall expression. But grant 
Samaria
 could not
yeeld dust enough to fill the hands, the mountains near unto it could
afford dirt enough to stop the mouths of most of his army, who few
days after were thereon miraculously
 defeated.


§ 28. A second siege was in the reign of King 
Ioram,
 when the famine
was so great,
 that an Asses head, and a cab of dung was sold at un∣conscionable
rates: the former for food, the latter most probably for


fewell, and surely not to drain peter to make powder thence, an inven∣tion
unknown in that age. Nor was the sudden plenty, occasioned by
the 
Syrians
 flight, less admirable, all provision being brought down in
an instant to a very unexpected low price. So that he that here knew
beforehand what would be cheap or dear, needed but a few minutes to
make him a rich Merchant. But this showre of plenty caused a floud of
people to flock to the gates of 
Samaria,
 where that infidell Prince, who
despaired of Gods power and 
Elisha's
 prophecy, was
 overwhelmed in
the multitude; living so long to have his eyes confute his tongue, but
not to have his taste confirme his eyes; beholding, but not partaking of
the plenty.


§ 29. The third and last siege when the city was taken and destroyed
by 
Salmaneser
 King of 
Assyria,
 in the reign of 
Hosea
 King of 
Israel,
 a
King who was the best, or rather the least bad of all that sate on that
throne. Of whom it is said, 
he was evill in the sight of the Lord, but
 not as the
Kings of Israel, that were before him.
 It may therefore seem wonderfull that the
ruin of the kingdome should happen in his reign: but what shall we
say? When a vessell is already brimfull, the addition of the least drop
more, will make it run over.


§ 30. Afterwards 
Samaria
 was peopled with Colonies 
of the Assyrians;

great back friends to the rebuilding of 
Ierusalem,
 as the books of 
Ezra

and 
Nehemiah
 doe sufficiently declare. Our Saviour therefore gave in
charge to the disciples, when sent to preach, 
Into
 any city of the Samaritans
enter yee not.
 But this was but a temporary prohibition, for after Christs
ascension and the persecution about 
Steven, Samaria
 quickly received the
Gospell by the preaching of
 
Philip the Evangelist.
 Here afterwards hap∣pened
the great contest betwixt the two 
Simons, Peter
 and 
Magus.
 The
latter
 profering money to buy the gift of bestowing the holy Ghost.
But leaving them we may observe Gods gradation in giving his holy
Spirit. First, to those that were purely 
Iews
 in
 
Ierusalem;
 Then to such as
were partly 
Iews
 in 
Samaria;
 Lastly, to such as were purely Gentiles
 in

Cesarea,
 where 
Cornelius
 was baptized.


§ 31. Near 
Samaria
 was a fountain to wash,
 and house to sheare the
sheep. Nigh to which in the rode to 
Iezreel, Iehu
 met two
 and fourty
men comming on a visite of respect, to salute the late slain sons of the
King of 
Israel.
 Wherefore because the persons they came to waite on
were not in this world, 
Iehu
 took order to send them all to the grave,
that they might be more perfectly informed how it fared with those,
whom they came to salute. Hard by is the 
Lazar-house,
 wherein lived
those
 Lepers, who being bandied betwixt two deaths of the famine
and the sword, 
preferred
 to put themselves on sudden and doubtfull, ra∣ther
then on slow but certain destruction; and first brought to 
Sama∣ria

the tydings of the 
Syrians
 tents left empty of men, and full of
provision.



§ 32. We must not forget the people near 
Samaria,
 wherein 
Ahabs

chariot was washed, though some difference appears betwixt the pre∣diction
and performance thereof.

Prediction. 1 
King.
 21. 19.
 Thus saith the Lord, In the place where
the dogs licked the bloud of Naboth, shall
dogs lick thy bloud, even thine.
Performance. 1 
King.
 22. 28.
 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria,
and the dogs licked up his bloud, and they washed his ar∣mour
according to the word of the Lord, which he spak.


The difficulty is this; the dogs licked the bloud of 
Ahab at Samaria

whereas 
Naboth
 was stoned at
 
Iezreel,
 twenty miles and more north∣ward.
To reconcile which difference, 
Rabbi Salomon
 conceives that
though 
Ahabs
 chariot was washed at 
Samaria,
 his armour was washed
at 
Iezreel,
 where (saith he) the royall armory was kept. Others fancy
an out-let of the poole of 
Samaria
 in the river 
Kison,
 which many miles
off glided by the vineyard of 
Naboth,
 so that his bloud might be carried
thither down the stream. Lastly, it is generally answered, that those
words, 
In the place,
 are not to be taken restrictively for the same numeri∣call
spot of ground, but extensively for the same Land, countrey, and
kingdome, which then was fulfilled according to the Prophets predicti∣on.
Not to say, that some understand, 
In the place where the dogs licked,
 that
is, 
pro eo quod, in stead, in lieu,
 or 
in requitall
 of thy cruelty, 
dogs shall lick thy
bloud, &c.
 Nor have I ought else to observe of 
Samaria,
 save that 
Herod

called the name thereof 
Sebaste
 from a fair Temple erected here, in the
honour of 
Augustus Cesar.


§ 33. Hard by,
 are 
Ebal
 and 
Gerizim,
 twin-mountains of equall height,
on which, in the days of
 
Ioshua,
 after the conquest of the land, the peo∣ple
of 
Israel,
 according to Gods
 command, assembled themselves, with

their
 women, little ones, and strangers,
 in manner and method following,



On mount 
Gerizim
 to bless.


1
 Simeon.


2 Levi.


3 Iudah.


4 Issachar.


5 Ioseph.


6 Benjamin.




On mount 
Ebal
 to curse.


1 Reuben.


2 Gad.


3 Asher.


4 Zebulun.


5 Dan.


6 Naphtali.




See we here, both the Royall and Sacerdotall tribes 
(Iudah
 and 
Levi
)
on the blessing side; all cursings and imprecations (save when of abso∣lute
necessity) ill becoming the mouths of Magistrates and Ministers.
In this action, the 
Levites
 appeared in a double capacity; as publick
officers, so 
they spake to the men of Israel with a loud
 voice;
 and as private
persons, so they contributed their 
Amen,
 with the rest of the people.


§ 34. Here it will be demanded,
 seeing the sides of this Quire were
so far asunder, how could the 
Levites
 voices be distinctly heard from one
mountain to another, especially if the whole city of 
Sechem
 (as the

Rabbin will have it) lay interposed betwixt them: and may not divine
service as well be warranted in a language unknown, as unheard; both
being equally understood? For answer whereunto, we must know,
that the very make, and fashion of these mountains (pick'd out by
Gods providence for that purpose) might advantage much the articulate


audibility of the Levites voices, especially if (as some fancy them) they
bended tops, hanged over and leaned inwards, so, as it were with mutuall
consent, more conveniently to reach the sound from the one to the other.
We know what
 some have written of the mountains in 
Merionith-shire,
so even in height that the shepheards may talke together on the tops of them, yet so, that
if haply they appoint to meet together, they can hardly doe it from morning to night.

Besides, the people knew before hand, the very numericall words, both
of the blessings, and cursings, which the Levites were to pronounce, and
this rendred their voice intelligible at the greater distance. For, our eares
and eyes quickly own those objects far off, with which formerly they
have been familiarly acquainted. Lastly, the Levites uttered no long
continued orations, but short speeches severally distinguished, with the
full periods of the peoples 
Amen,
 which gave fair notice to their neigh∣bours
on the next mountain, when to begin, and end their attention;
and sentences so plainly pointed, are more easily understood at greater
distance.


§ 35. On mount 
Ebal,
 where the curses were pronounced, a solemn
Altar was, according to
 Gods command, set up by 
Ioshua; and burnt,
and
 peace offerings,
 were sacrificed thereon. No more then needed, for
otherwise, the maledictions had no sooner been uttered, but condem∣nation,
and execution had instantly ensued, if these sacrifices, with the
merits of Christ typified therein, had not seasonably interceded. This
altar was made of whole stones, without Iron lift upon it, and was
plaistered over, serving also for a table-book (the stones being the leaves,
and in the plaistering were the letters thereof) wherein, by Gods com∣mand,

all the
 words of the law
 were written very plainly: not that all 
Deute∣ronomy,

much less all the Pentateuch was registred thereon (where
should they finde, and how should they fetch stones in 
folio
 for so vo∣luminous
a work?) but, either the thirteen cursings (with their op∣posite
blessings) mentioned there; or else the ten Commandements,
the Breviate, and abstract of the whole law.


§ 36. But mount 
Gerizim
 was the 
Holy of holies
 to the 
Samaritans,
 in af∣ter
ages commonly calling it the 
blessed mountain,
 and confining their pub∣lick
service, and sacrifices, to that place. Here, to avoid confusion, we
must take notice of two distinct sorts, or sects of 
Samaritans,
 differing
much amongst themselves, in.





1 Antiquity.


2 Extraction.


3 Religion.


4 Place of their worship.






One from 
Hez
kiahs
 time.


Heathens by descent.


Heret
call.


Any where in the province of 
Samaria.






Another from 
 ti
e.


Mongrel-
Iews.


Idolatrous.


In mount 
Gerizim
 alone.






We begin with the former, being colonies of 
Assyrians,
 planted by

Salmaneser
 in the place of the ten Tribes, which he had carried away in∣to
finall captivity. These at first were devoured with Lions, saith the

 Scripture, though
 
Iosephus
 affirmeth, that the plague; the 
Samaritan
Chronicle,
 that the famine destroyed them. Presumption in them to de∣viate
from Gods word; for though both plague and famine may in


some sense be allowed to be Lions, that is, devourers; yet such as con∣found
them, destroy Gods solemn Quadripartite of his punishments;
making three members, of his 
four sore judgements
 mentioned in the

Prophet, 
coincidere, to interfeer,
 yea run all into one. Afterward, a Jewish
Priest was at their request sent out of 
Assyria,
 to teach these 
Samaritans
the
 manner of the God of the land.
 He is called 
Ezdras
 by
 
Epiphanius,
 by others

 
Lun,
 and by some 
Zacharias;
 but seeing God hath concealed his name,
it is no whit materiall to know it, especially, except he had taught them
better divinity. For he instructed them not to serve God as they ought,
in his Temple then extant at 
Ierusalem,
 but in their own countrey, ac∣cording
to the 
direction of Ieroboam;
 and then, no wonder, if the 
Samari∣tans

were guilty of abominable impieties. For, as water neither will,
nor can naturally ascend higher, then just levell to the spring, or foun∣tain,
whence it is derived: so these people were capable of no purer
service of God, then as they were principled by this superstitious Priest,
who either did not know, or would not teach them the true Religion.
Yea, their practise fell short of his precepts, not worshipping one God
alone, but every city had also a severall
 Idoll to themselves, according
to the nations, whence they were descended. These were the ancient
Idolatrous 
Samaritans,
 which, as 
Chrysostome
 saith, did 
, min∣gle
what was not to be conjoined, and which in process of time were
well wasted, and few (if any of them) extant in the days of our Sa∣viour.


§ 37. These were succeeded with a second sort of hereticall 
Samari∣tans,

beginning in the government of 
Nehemiah,
 who
 reporteth, that 
one of
the sons of Iojada, the son of Eliashib the high-priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the
Horonite, and therefore I chased him from me.
 This Priest is by 
Iosephus
 called

Manasse;
 who thus driven away from 
Ierusalem,
 went with other 
Iews,

guilty of the like mongrell-matches, to the 
Samaritans
 their wives kind∣red,
and there (as the Jewish
 writers relate) built an Anti-temple on
mount 
Gerizim,
 where a medly nation devised a miscellaneons worship
of God, rejecting all the Scriptures, save the five books of 
Moses,
 and
maintaining many abominable superstitions. And yet they were not so
bad, as 
Epiphanius
 makes them, charging them by a far-fetch'd conse∣quence,
to worship heathen Gods, because placing sanctity in that
mountain, wherein 
Iacob
 buried his Idols,
 whilst some tax them to a∣dore
a 
Dove,
 the Armes of the Kings of 
Babylon,
 and others unjustly ac∣cuse
them, utterly to deny the resurrection; we remit the Reader to our
learned
 Authour, who cleareth them from these false aspersions; and,
though we our selves will not take the pains to plead their cause, let us
have the patience, to hear others speak for the worst of men, when un∣justly
traduced.


§ 38. But the main difference in matter of Religion,
 betwixt the 
Sa∣maritans,

and 
Iews,
 is no less briefly, then cleerly, and truly stated in those


words of the woman to our Saviour,
 
Our Fathers [Samaritans] worship∣ped
in this mountain [Gerizim,] and yee [Iews] say, that in Ierusalem is the place
where men ought to worship.
 The contest grew high betwixt them, each zea∣lous
to assert the transcendent holiness of their Temple; insomuch, that
the 
Samaritans
 made the text false, to make their title true, wilfully de∣praving
the originall. For, whereas we read in the Hebrew, both that

 
Moses
 directed, and 
Ioshua
 erected an Altar on mount 
Ebal,
 the
 
Sama∣ritan
Pentateuch
 make the same built on mount 
Gerizim,
 in the very place
where afterwards their mock-Temple was set up, so to gain thereunto
the greater reputation of holiness. This false foundation laid, they pro∣ceeded
thereon, to vaunt of the excellency of their divine service, exceed∣ing
the 
Iews
 in



1 Antiquity,
 it bearing date from this solemn Altar, four hun∣dred
and odde years before the structure of the Temple by 
Solo∣mon.

And, if the 
Iews
 once offered to plead the originall of their
Temple from 
Abraham
 sacrificing his son 
Isaac
 on mount 
Moriah,

then the 
Samaritans
 to outvy them, derived the seniority and
sanctity of their mountain, from the first apparition God made
to
 
Abraham,
 and first Altar 
Abraham
 made to God in the land of

Canaan,
 both in this, before 
Isaac
 was ever promised.


2 Constant continuance, pretending an uninterrupted succession
of divine service in this place, whilest they objected the long in∣termission
of Gods worship in 
Ierusalem,
 lying wast during the
seventy years of the captivity in 
Babylon.




But, oh how light and slight, how few and feeble are the 
Samaritan

arguments for the place of their worship, if compared to the numerous,
ponderous, pregnant proofes 
Iews
 can produce, for Gods presence fixed
in 
Ierusalem!
 The 
Samaritans
 therefore were wise in their generation, to
admit alone of the five books of 
Moses
 for canonicall (wherein all their
supposed evidences, for the matter in controversie, are contained) seeing
otherwise, had they accepted of the rest of the Prophets in the old Testa∣ment,
their witness had utterly overthrown the 
fundamentals of their Reli∣gion,

which so frequently make 
Ierusalem
 the proper center of all pious
mens devotion. One instance for many;
 
Moreover he refused the taber∣nacle
of Ioseph, and chose not the Tribe of Ephraim; but chose the Tribe of Iudah, the
mount Sion which he loved. And he built his sanctuary like-high palaces, like the earth
which he hath established for ever.
 Here 
Ephraim
 is singled out by himself,
as of all the Tribes, most probable in after-ages to justle with 
Iudah,
 for
the place of Gods publick service (in whose portion was mount 
Geri∣zim,

besides
 
Shiloh
 where the tabernacle so long resided) and yet he is
cleerly cast, and the cause adjudged against him, by the immediate deter∣mination
of God himself.


§ 39. We have no more to say of the 
Samaritan
 temple on mount

Gerizim,
 save onely that
 
Antiochus
 afterward turned it for a time into


the temple of 
Iupiter that keepeth hospitality.
 Sure I am, the 
Samaritans
 practi∣sed
small hospitality in the countrey hereabouts; denying to give our
Saviour entertainment in their towns
 because he was going to 
Ierusa∣lem.

The truth is, this temple was destroyed, somewhat before the time
of our Saviour, by 
Iohn
 Hyrcanus,
 after it had flourished above two hun∣dred
years: but, when the temple was taken away, the mountain re∣mained,
in which the 
Samaritans
 continued their adoration. We con∣clude
all with the words of the son of
 
Sirach, There be two manner of nati∣ons
which my heart abhorreth, and the third is no nation: They that sit upon the moun∣tains
of Samaria, and they that dwell amongst the Philistines, and that foolish people
that dwell in Sichem.
 Meaning by the first, the Idolatrous, by the last, the
hereticall 
Samaritans,
 who indeed were no distinct nation (as Leopards,
and mules, are properly no creatures) but a mixture of 
Iews,
 and 
heathen,

blended together.


§ 41. Expect not here from me (as alien from our work in hand)
any arguments,
 against their presumption, who have dared to compare,
yea prefer the 
Samaritan Pentateuch,
 for authenticalness, before the He∣brew
Originall. 
For three things
 (saith
 
Solomon) the earth is disquieted, and
the fourth it can not bear,
 namely, 
an handmaid that is heire to her mistress.
 How
much more intolerable then is it, when a translation, which is, or ought
to be, the dutifull servant to the originall, shall presume, (her mistress be∣ing
extant, and in presence,) to take the place and precedency of her? As
here, 
apographum
 doth of the 
autographum,
 when the 
Samaritan
 transcript
is by some
 advanced above the canonicall copy in the Hebrew. All I
will adde is this, that to the 
Iews 
, were
 committed
the oracles of God:
 and, to give them their due, they were carefull preservers
thereof, being never reproved by our Saviour, (though often for false∣glosses
thereon) of any forgery in corrupting, depraving, or altering the

Letter of the text:
 whereas no such trust appears, delivered to the charge of
the 
Sama
itans.
 In a word, such as defend, that the Pentateuch coming from
the hereticall (not to say apostate 
Samaritans
) is purer then that in He∣brew,
transmitted to us from the 
Iews,
 in that age the onely
 true Church
of God in the world, may with as much truth maintain, that breath
proceeding from putrefied and corrupted lungs, is more healthfull and
wholesome, then what cometh from vitals sound and entire.


§ 42. 
Shechem,
 which we lately mentioned, lay betwixt the aforesaid
mountains; a place stained with many treacherous practises, which
were acted therein. Here 
Dinah
 went out 
to see the daughters of the land,
 so
to please her fancy with gazing on forein fashions. O where was the
tent, wherein her great-grand-mother
 
Sarah
 lived, that now she had
left it? Where was the
 vaile, wherewith her grand-mother 
Rebekah

covered her face, that now she had lost it? Her own mother 
L
ahs
 eyes,
which were weak and tender, (those worse) were better then 
Dinahs,

which were wanton, and wandring. She sees, and is seen, and is lik'd,



nd lusted after, and (whether by force, or fraud) defiled, and still pas∣sionately
affected; contrary to what commonly happens, that the snuffe
of lust goes out in the stink
 of loathing. Yea 
Shechem
 was so honest
in his dishonesty, that he desired to make 
Dinah
 the best amends he
could give, or she receive, and on any rate went about to purchase 
the
vine
 to himself, so to colour a title to those unripe grapes, which he had
snatched from it. The agreement is made, on condition all the 
Sheche∣mites

should be circumcised; which done, on the
 third day (when
commonly wounds are more painfull, then when first given) 
Simeon

and 
Levi
 kill all the males of the city, and the rest of their brethren fall
on the spoile thereof.


§ 42. Long after,
 
Abimelech,
 the base-born and bloody-minded son
of good 
Gedeon,
 was by the 
Shechemites
 (his towns-men by his mothers
side) here 
at the
 stone in the plain,
 made King of 
I
rael;
 whilest 
Iotham

(which of his seventy brethren had onely escap'd his cruelty) from the
top of mount
 
Gerizim,
 uttered his parable of the Bramble, kinging it
over the trees of the wood. Bramble; which he applied so home to
the men of 
Shechem,
 that for the present, he left the pricks thereof in the
ears of his auditours; the pain whereof they found and felt afterwards
in their hearts, when God put a spirit of discord betwixt them, and

Abimelech.


§ 43. We finde not the particular cause,
 but the effects of the discord
betwixt them. Insomuch that 
Abimelech
 sacked the city of 
Shechem,
 and

 
sowed it with salt.
 A formality usuall in that age in execration of peoples
perfidiousness: but whence fetching its originall, it is hard to decide. I
dare not say, in imitation of God himself, who when he destroyed the
wicked cities of 
Sodome
 and 
Gomorrah,
 turned the fruitfull vales wherein
they stood, 
into the
 salt-sea,
 in token of their perpetuall desolation. Sure
I am, the custome hath been imitated in these western parts. For 
Fre∣derick
Barbarossa,
 for some affronts offered to his Empress by those of

Millan,
 razed the city, and sowed it with
 salt.


§ 44. The 
Shechemites
 retreated into the house of 
Baal-berith
 their God,
hoping in vain to make it good for their defence.
 For 
Abimelech
 fetching
fuell from the neighbouring mountain of 
Zalmon
 (whence the Psal∣mist
fetched his expression of spotless purity, 
white as snow in
 Zalmon,

which commonly candied the top of this mountain, being the Jewish

Albion
) and firing the tower of the Temple, slew therein a thousand men
and women. Then no doubt 
the
 house of Millo
 was destroyed: which I
take not for any building in the city of 
Shechem
 (though there was a fair
street of that
 name in 
Ierusalem
) but for a potent and puissant family
therein, (as the house of the 
Fuggers
 in 
Auspurge
) who first advanced

Abimelech,
 and sought, when too late, to suppress. But the weaker sexe
revenged on 
Abimelech
 his cruelty to them, when besieging the tower of

Thebez,
 which we conceive hard by 
Shechem,
 (having no other indication,


but this single mention for the posture thereof) a woman broke his
brain-pan with a piece of a
 milstone.


§ 45. Though not the 
salt
 which was sown,
 yet the city of 
Shechem,

grew up again to its former greatness. Hither repaired 
Rehoboam
 for the
people to make him King. One may haply sent 
Ieroboams
 policy & his hand
in appointing the place, in his own Tribe of 
Ephraim,
 where his party was
most puissant:
 who intending to run a race with 
Rehoboam
 for a Crown,
chose out the ground most advantageous for himself. Here the people
presented 
Rehoboam
 with a Petition for the mitigation of the intolerable
burdens, whether personall, or pecuniary, which 
Solomon
 imposed upon
them. How came he to be behind hand who was the most wealthy
Prince in the world? Surely not the building of Gods, but his Idols
temples impaired his treasure; and women impoverished both his
wealth and his wisdome. Seven hundred
 Queens, and not unlikely so
many Courts; and three hundred Concubines, which though lesser
then the former in honour, might be greater in expence (as the 
Thiefe
 in
the Candle wasteth more then the burning of the 
wiek
) were able to
bankrupt the land of 
Ophir,
 with 
Tarshish
 given in to boot▪ 
Rehoboam
 re∣quires three
 days respite for his answer: the onely act almost wherein
he shewed himself wise 
Solomons
 son; seeing in matters of such conse∣quence,
extemporary returns give men leasure afterwards to meditate
their Repentance.


§ 46. The old men advise 
Rehoboam
 for remission and mitigation
of taxes.
 What harm was it if He being now to be married to a Crown
should waite on his Bride the wedding-day, that she might obey him all
her life after? Especially they counselled 
him to
 speake good words to the peo∣ple,

though his good deeds might follow at a distance. And truely fair
speeches cost the giver nothing, and doe ease, though not cure the dis∣contented receiver. But 
Rehoboam
 followed the advice of the young men
(hot heads, enough to set a kingdome on fire) not to satisfie, but sup∣press
the peoples desires, threatning to make his little finger heavier then
his Fathers loines; (more happy if he had made his head but half as
wise) so that the people deserting the house of 
David,
 clave to 
Ieroboam

for their King.


§ 47. During this distemper,
 
Rehoboam
 sent 
Adoram,
 who was 
over
the Tribute,
 unto the people. No doubt in hope that they would reverence
his gray-haires, not abating much of an hundred years in age, (having
enjoyed that office above threescore years, from the midst of the reign of
King
 
David;
) or else to give them some orall satisfaction, how all sums
had formerly been expended for the publick good. But his sight was of∣fensive
to the people, whose very looks seemed to demand a taxe, and
his eyes to exact tribute of them: insomuch that the
 people stoned him
to death. To lesson all 
money-officers
 from publick appearance in po∣pular
tumults, being persons most obnoxious to the spight and spleen


of the Vulgar. Thus in 
Iack St
awes
 Rebellion, their fury fell first
and fiercest on Sir 
Robert Hales
 Lord of Saint 
Iohns,
 and then
Lord Treasurer, whom they drew out of the Chappell in the Tower;
and without any reverence of his estate or degree, with fell noise
and huge cryes struck off his head on
 Tower-hill. Nor did Sir

ames Fines,
 Lord 
Saie,
 and Treasurer of England, fare better in

he Rebellion of 
Iack Cade,
 whom without any judiciall proceed∣ings,
before his confession was ended, they
 executed at the
standard in 
Cheapside.
 And now it was high time for 
Rehoboam
 to
call for his Chariot, and hast to 
Ierusalem.


§ 48.
 Near to 
Shechem
 was the parcell of ground which 
Iacob

bought of the children of 
Hamor
 for an hundred pieces of money,
whereon he spread his tent, and erected an Altar called 
God the

God of Israel.
 Afterwards 
Iacob
 gave it as a portion to his son 
Ioseph,

whose bones brought out of 
Egypt
 were
 buried therein. But how

Iacob,
 when he bequeathed this land to 
Ioseph,
 could properly call
it, 
A portion.
 which he took out of the hands of the Amorites with his sword
and by his bow,
 is a difficulty much perplexing Divines in the solu∣tion
thereof, meeting onely with 
Iacobs
 staffe (though 
Esau
 had a
bow) in the Tenour of Scripture: We will present the Reader with
their best answers, leaving him to chuse which he conceives most
probable.


Some conceive


1 That 
Iacob
 being a peaceable and plain dealing man,
in reproof of such as delight in force and violence,
called his money 
his sword and his bow.
 And indeed
in all ages money is the sharpest sword, and bow that
best hits the mark yea
 
answereth all things.


2 That thereby he meant his prayers (the Armes of the
Patriarchs and Primitive Christians) whereby he
obtained of God, that his posterity being now in
his loins, in due time should by their martiall atchiev∣ments
conquer the countrey; and speakes of the con∣quest
as already made, because of the undoubted assu∣rance
of it upon Gods promise.


3 That his sword and his bow import no more then his
industry and endevours. Thus the Latine phrase, 
Fecit
proprio marte,
 carrieth a warlike sound, but a peaceable
sense, when one acquires a thing, though in a legall way

with his own might,
 without the assistance of others, as

Iacob
 purchased the foresaid heritage.


4 That his sword related not to his purchase, but to the
city of
 
Shechem,
 which 
Simeon
 and 
Levi
 won by their
sword, and the sons conquest is reputed to their Father.



Now let none be troubled because 
Iacob
 is said to purchase this land


of the 
Amorites, Hamor
 of whom he bought it being an
 
Hivite: Amorite

being there taken in a genericall sense, as all the inhabitants of the eight
united Provinces, are comonly called 
Hollanders.


§ 49. Near to this parcell of ground which 
Iacob
 gave to 
Ioseph,
 stood
the city of 
Sychar;
 wherein was the well, at which that excellent dis∣course
passed betwixt our Saviour and the
 
Samaritan woman,
 who came
thither to draw water. Some also place hereabouts the city 
Shalem
 foun∣ding
it on the words of the text, 
And Iacob came to
 Shalem a city of Shechem.

Which the 
Chaldee
 and other translations read, 
and Iacob came safe or sound
and entire to a city of Shechem.
 Not that here he was healed of his halting
(as some will have it) but rather that hitherto no notorious or emi∣nent
dysaster befell his family, which afterwards fell thick and threefold
upon it. As the defiling of 
Dinah; Simeon
 and 
Levi
 slaughtering the 
She∣chemites;
Reubens
 incest; 
Rachels
 death; 
Er
 and 
Onan
 slain by God; 
Iudah's

incest with 
Tamar; Ioseph
 sold by his brethren.


§ 50. And now to take our farewell of the countrey about 
Shechem,

anciently called the
 
plain of Moreh:
 two eminent oakes grew therein.
One, under which 
Iacob
 buried his heathen Gods, with the superstitious

 ear-rings of his family, wherein no doubt, Idols were ingraven. Ano∣ther,
under which was a great stone solemnly set up by 
Ioshua
 with the
words of the Law
 written thereon, to be a witness against the 
Israelites,

in case afterwards they should deny that God, whom then they gene∣rally
resolved to serve But the question will be how this latter oake
was termed to be
 
by the Sanctuary of the Lord;
 seeing the Tabernacle, and
the Sanctuary Lieger therein resided at
 
Shiloh
 in those days. If any say
that every place where men seriously set their souls to serve God is his
Sanctuary; they speake rather an Evangelicall truth, then a proper an∣swer
to the present question. This inclines me to conceive, either that
by Sanctuary is meant that place of the Altar, which 
Iacob
 long before
thereabouts erected; or that the Tabernacle not far off, was brought
hither for the instant occasion, and afterwards returned back unto

Shiloh.


§ 51. 
Dothan
 lay east of 
Shechem,
 wherein the Prophet 
Elisha
 for some
time made his abode. Here he was complained of to the King of 
Syria,

for being the pick-lock of his Cabinet-councels: and therefore an ar∣my
was ordered to apprehend him. But why so many to attach a single
person and his servant? Indeed no more then needed. For 
Elisha
 alone
was an army in himself
 being 
the horsemen of Israel and chariots thereof▪

His servant seeing themselves surrounded cryes out, till having his eyes
opened, he discovereth themselves guarded with a fiery army on the
tops of the mountains. Thus Angels are good mens Janizaries to pro∣tect
them, and those 
Natives
 of heaven grudge not to guard those, who
are onely 
free Denizens
 thereof. The 
Syrians
 are
 smitten with blind∣ness;
and they that came for the destruction, are glad to follow the


direction of 
Elisha.
 Indeed to whom should blind men goe, but to the
Prophet, 
the Seer,
 to guide them? He leads them, for the present, the
wrong way to their intents and desires, but in fine the right way to Gods
glory, and their safety; in stead of 
Dothan,
 bringing them to 
Samaria.

How easily are those misled who lack the use of eyes? And (alass!)
whither will implicire faith, and blind obedience steer the followers
thereof? Yet here all came off in a peaceable close; so that their lives being
saved, sight restored, bodies feasted, and mindes better informed, they re∣turned
to 
Damascus.
 If I must be a captive, may I be a prisoner to a pious
Prophet, so shall I be best used, and my ransome easiliest procured.


§ 52. This 
Dothan
 I take to be the very place,
 where 
Ioseph
 found his bre∣thren,
and there was put into the pit, and sold to the Merchants. For being
sent by his Father to
 
Shechem,
 he was by a man directed to 
Dothan,
 whither
his brethren had removed their flocks, and which probably was not
far off, but some few miles from the former place. Wherefore, when for∣merly
in the description of 
Zebulun,
 we placed 
Dothan
 in the northern
parts of that Tribe, threescore miles from 
Shechem,
 therein we were carri∣ed
away with the common current of other mens judgements, and now
have watched our advantage to swim back again, and shew our private
opinion in the position thereof. And besides the aforesaid text, setling

Dothan
 near 
Shechem
 in this Tribe of 
Ephraim,
 it is proportionable to di∣vine
providence, that the place whereon 
Ioseph
 was betrayed, and pit
wherein he was put, should in after ages fall to the possession of the sons
of 
Ephraim
 descended from him.


§ 53. But here a materiall Question will be started,
 how 
Ioseph
 could
properly say, that 
he was stolen away out of the
 land of the Hebrews;
 when
the Hebrews at that time, 
had none inheritance in it, no not so
 much as to set
their foot on?
 Say not that 
Ioseph
 being a child when taken away might be
allowed to speak incongruously; for we behold his words as uttered
by him when a man. And surely he, who then could expound dreames,
could express himself in proper language. Some conceive it was termed

the Land of the Hebrews,




1 From those few Hebrews, the family of 
Iacob,
 living there, though
not as inhabitants, but onely as sojourners therein.


2 It was the 
Land of the Hebrews
 by promise, and in due time should
be theirs by possession.


3 
The Land of the Hebrews,
 though not in linage, in language; the

Canaanites
 speaking the same tongue with 
Iacobs
 family.


4 Some conceive this land anciently belonged to 
Heber,
 (as all 
Asia

to the sons of 
Shem,
) and that the 
Canaanites
 had before 
Abrahams

time encroached on that Countrey.




To strengthen this last conjecture, we must remember that 
Melchise∣dech
King of Salem,
 who generally is conceived to be 
Shem,
 the ancestour
of the 
Hebrews,
 still retained his
 kingdome in the land of 
Canaan.
 And


it might be that the other Hebrews were ejected by the 
Canaanites.
 If so,
the 
Israelites
 afterwards got the land under 
Ioshua
 by a double Right, of
Conquest, and Recovery.


§ 54. In this Tribe no doubt was the city 
Ephraim,

in a
 
Countrey near
to the wilderness:
 where our Saviour that Sun of righteousness clouded
himself for a time when the 
Iews
 took counsell to kill him. Wonder
not, that we cannot find the exact situation of this place. For Christ
chose it on purpose for the privacy and obscurity thereof. Thus though
willing
 
to lay down,
 he was not willing to cast away his life: unfit to
be a Saviour of mankind, if a destroyer of himself. And though he
knew well, that all the weights of mans craft and cruelty, could not
make the clock of his time strike one minute 
before his
 hour was come;
 yet
he counted it his duty, by Prudentiall means to endevour self-preser∣vation.


§ 55. Two eminent places remain,
 which we have reserv'd for the
last, because of the uncertainty of their particular situation, though both
of them certainly in this Tribe. One, the 
hill of Phinehas, which was given
him in mount
 Ephraim.
 Let no sacrilegious hands hasten hither with their
Spades, and Mattocks, to pare and abate this hill as too large a possessi∣on
for the high Priest, seeing a greater had been too small for his deserts,
who
 
stood up, and executed judgement, and so the plague ceased.
 This 
Hill of
Phinehas
 certainly was with in the circumference of some 
Leviticall city
 in
this Tribe, and we conjecturally have placed it within the circuit of

Beth-horon the upper.
 Here, religious 
Eleazar
 the son of 
Aaron
 was
 buried,
in this hill belonging to his son 
Phinehas.


§ 56. The other the 
Mount of Amaleck
 in the land of Ephraim.
 But how
came the 
Amalekites,
 to have any thing in the heart of 
Ephraim,
 whose
own countrey lay two hundred miles more south-ward near the Red-sea?
And yet it is no wonder to finde theeves, and robbers (such were
the
 
Amalekites
) in any place, who like the Devill their father,
 
goe to
and fro in the earth, walking up and down therein.
 But we are confident, this
mountain was so called from some eminent thing, here done, or suf∣fered
by the 
Amalekites.
 For we finde them joined with the 
Midianites
 in
the days of
 
Gedeon,
 to destroy 
Israel,
 and finde afterwards this Tribe of

 
Ephraim
 very succesfull in doing execution on the remains of the 
Midia∣nitish

Army when defeated. Why then might not this mountain of 
A∣malek

be so named from some 
Amalekites
 then slain in this place? As 
Danes∣end,

in the west-side of 
Hartford-shire,
 took its name from a
 battell there∣by,
wherein the 
Danes
 were overthrown. In 
Pirathon,
 a town on 
mount
Amalek, Abdon
 one of the peaceable Judges in 
Israel,
 was interred.


§ 57. I conceived all memorable places described in this Tribe,

but
on review do discover a guilty town lurking besides
 
Ephraim
 as if con∣scious
of the treachery committed therein, it endevoured to escape our
observation, namely 
Baal-hazor,
 where 
Absolom
 sheared his sheep. If any


demand, how he came by any land in this Tribe to feed cattell therein;
no doubt he held it by gift or grant from 
David
 his Father; and how

David
 when King, became possessed of demesnes in all Tribes, hath

 formerly been largely resolved. Nor was it any disgrace to a 
Kings son

to be master of sheep, seeing 
the
 King himself is maintained by husbandry.
 As
commendable the thrift: so damnable the cruelty of 
Absolom
 in this
place, causing the murder of his brother 
Amnon
 just
 
when his heart was
merry with wine,
 as if his wild revenge would imitate divine justice, to kill
both
 
body and soul
 together. This 
Amnon
 was he that
 feigned himself
sick when he was well, and now dyed before he was sick.


§ 58. Let 
Archelais
 not be forgotten,
 half ashamed to bear the name
of wicked 
Archelaus
 the builder
 thereof, son and successour of 
Herod

in 
Iudea,
 whose cruelty
 frighted 
Ioseph
 from returning to 
Beth-lehem,

and diverted him to 
Nazareth.
 As 
Archelais
 took its name from a wic∣ked
man: so 
Iscariot
 (a village not far from it) gave name to a worse;
that traitour of his Master being born in this place, as 
Adrichomius
 out of
Saint 
Hierome
 will have it. But other reasons are rendered of 
Iudas
 his
syrname, and the place of his exemplary
 death is more certainly
known, then that of his obscure nativity. As for 
Apollonia
 by the sea side,

 
Addida over against the plain,
 with some other petite places in 
Ephraim,

they are well known by their severall markes, not to be mentioned in
Canonicall Scripture.


§ 59. The 
Son of Hur
 was 
Solomons
 monethly Purveyour 
in mount

Ephraim.
 The standard of 
Ephraim
 was pitched first on the
 
west side of the
Tabernacle:
 Armes anciently depicted thereon, 
an Oxe sable passant, in a
field argent,
 founded on
 
Moses
 his words, 
His beauty shall be like the firstling of
a bullock,
 to which we may ad the prophecy of 
Hosea,
 Ephraim is as an heifer
that is taught, and loveth to tread out the Corn.
 Which perchance gave occasion
to the postnate armes usually assigned to this Tribe, though later by
twelve hundred years then their ancient standard erected in the wilder∣ness.






Here the Map of 
DAN
 is to be inserted.
























THE TRIBE OF DAN. CHAP. 10.


§ 1. 
D
AN
 was eldest Son of 
Iacob
 by
 
Bilhah Ra∣hels

maide and his concubine. Of his body
but one, 
[Hushim]
 went down into 
Egypt,
 yet
of his Posterity came forth thence no fewer
then
 threescore and two thousand and seven
hundred males of twenty years old and up∣wards:
all which falling in the wilderness, for their faithlesness in
Gods promises,
 threescore and four thousand and four hundred entered
the land of 
Canaan.


§ 2. There passeth a generall tradition taken up by some Fathers,

continued by some middle, to modern Popish writers, that 
the Anti∣christ

should descend of the Tribe of 
Dan.
 And why conceive (or con∣ceit
they rather) so uncharitably of this Tribe? Confess we, that 
Dan

hears ill, on severall occasions in the Scripture.



1 
Dan,
 Father of this Tribe, had a foul mouth, which made


Ioseph
 bring in a complaint thereof to
 
Iacob.


2 The first personall blasphemy recorded amongst the 
Israelites

was committed by a 
Mongrell
 Danite,
 being the son of 
Shelo∣mith,

for which he was stoned.


3 The first tribuall defection to idolatry 
Dan
 was guilty of, publick∣ly

 setting up
 and worshipping a graven Image.


4 A moity of the nationall apostasie of the Idolatrous 
Iews
 was
solemnely acted on the theatre of this Tribe, one of
 
Ieroboams

golden calves being set up at 
Dan.


5 When twelve thousand of Gods 
sealed ones
 are reckoned up out of
every Tribe
, 
Dan
 is omitted, as consigned to malediction, say


some: as formerly in the first of 
Chronicles,
 no mention of 
Dan,


 where the genealogies of all other Tribes are recounted.



The reader may judge whether these roots be deep enough to bring and
beare the branches of so far spread report, that therefore the 
Man of sin

must derive his pedegree from this Tribe. Little probability of 
Anti∣christ

coming from 
Dan literall
 (long since carried captive with the rest
of his brethren into 
Africa
) but as for 
Dan mysticall
 many have sought,
and many conceive they have found him in another and nearer place.
But leaving the uncertainties of 
Antichrist,
 most sure it is, that 
Samson,
 one
of the liveliest types of Christ, was descended of 
Dan.
 And so was


Aholiab
 that excellent artist: who was joint master of the fabrick of
the Tabernacle: as 
Hiram
 also in the work of the Temple, was a

Danite
 on the mothers side.


§ 3. The land allotted to 
Dan,
 seems, for the most part, first to fall to
the share of 
Iudah
 at the partition of the Countrey. And because the
bounds of 
Iudah
 were too great, the surplusage thereof by a new grant
was made over to the 
Danites.
 Some will wonder, that God, who divi∣ded
Manna so equally, a 
homer for every man,
 should part the land so un∣evenly,
that one Tribe should leave and another lack: so that the thirst
of 
Simeon
 and 
Dan
 was quenched with those few drops, which over∣flowed
out of the cup of 
Iudah.
 May such remember, 
Iudah
 was the
Princely Tribe, out of which 
Messiah
 was to arise, and his portion cut
out in state; leaving the superfluous reversions thereof to others; may
typifie Christ himself, who is
 
anointed with oile of gladness above his fellows:
of whose fulness
 (not onely of sufficiency and abundance, but even of re∣dundance)

we have all received, grace for grace.
 Nor will the reader be
moved when he finds some cities ensuing, sometimes mentioned as be∣longing
to 
Iudah,
 other whiles to 
Dan:
 because to the former by ori∣ginall
assignation, and to the latter by actuall possession.


§ 4. This Countrey was bounded with 
Ephraim
 on the north, 
Iudah

on the east, 
Simeon
 on the south, and the 
Mid-land-sea
 on the west. From
above 
Lydda
 to the brook 
Soreck,
 some thirty miles; and litle less east and
west, from the sea to the edge of 
Iudah.
 A land at the best, but half 
Iu∣dah's

leavings, and that not entirely possessed of the 
Danites.
 For herein
the 
Amorites
 did both cut and chuse for themselves, reserving the fat
and flesh thereof, (all the fruitfull
 valley) for their own use, whilest
the 
Danites
 were glad to pick the bones, crowded up into the moun∣tains.
Besides, three of the 
Satrapies
 of the 
Philistines,
 are found in this
Tribe; A puissant nation, and at deadly fewd with the people of 
Israel.

This put the 
Danites
 on the necessity (men over-pent will some way
vent themselves) of seeking new Quarters,
 in that their memorable expe∣dition,
whereof formerly in 
Nephthali.
 If any aske, why they did not en∣devour
the enlargement of their bounds at home against the 
Amorites

and 
Philistines,
 before a far adventure, an hundred miles off. Let such


know, the designe was conceived easier, suddenly to surprize the secure

Leshemites,
 pursie with long peace, then to undertake those two
warlike nations, well breathed daily in military Discipline: And

 sudden surprisals were foretold in this Tribe.


§ 5. But grant the measure in this Tribe but short, the ware
thereof was very fine, the Countrey being passing fruitfull in com∣modities.
Herein grew that 
bunch of Grapes
 of prodigious greatness,
in gathering whereof, by the hand of the spies sent to search the
Land, the 
Israelites
 took Livery and Seisin of the fruits of the
Countrey. Besides, this Tribe did drive some 
sea-trade (Deborah

complains, 
Why did Dan
 remain in ships?
) though the 
Iews
 gene∣rally
were mean Mariners and Merchants. Partly because the fat∣ness
of their soile so stuck by their sides, it unactived them for
forein adventures: and natures bounty unto them gave their indu∣stry
a 
Writ of ease
 to sit at home. And partly because, being divi∣ded
(as an Island from the Continent of the World) in Religion
from other Countries, it cut off their comfortable commerce with
other nations: though since their wofull Posterity have proved the
Capemerchants of the world.


§ 6. First to survey the west side on the sea,
 therein we are
accosted with 
Ioppa,
 a strong City, seated on an high rock, so that

Strabo
 reports, that 
Ierusalem
 may thence be discovered: which
a modern
 Traveller concludes impossible. At the bottome there∣of
a haven [formerly] most convenient. So ancient a place, that
some make it first founded, and so named from 
Iapheth
 before the

 floud. But it is utterly improbable that 
Noah
 being himself bu∣sied
about building an Arke, which threatned the worlds de∣struction,
would suffer his son to erect a City, as promising a
fixt habitation. Hither all the timber of the Temple, cut down
and carved in mount 
Lebanon,
 was brought by the 
Tyrians
 in
 floates,
and hence by Carts conveyed to 
Ierusalem.
 Hither 
Ionah
 fled, and
took shipping for 
Tarshish
, conceived by some to be the Coun∣trey
of 
Cilicia;
 by others the city 
Tarsus
 therein. But be it Sea or
Land, Countrey or City, sure it was not 
Niniveh,
 whither God
had sent him. Here charitable
 
Dorcas
 which 
made coates and gar∣ments
for the poor widows whilest she was with them,
 (the lanthorn of
mens good deeds cast the best light, when carried before them,
and done in their life time) lived, dyed, and was revived by Saint

Peter.
 Here he lodged in the house of 
Simon
 a Tanner by the sea∣side,

 water we know is very necessary in that occupation (though
salt water onely usefull to wash raw hides) and therein beheld that
vision, wherein the Epitome of all creatures were in a sheet repre∣sented
unto him. Of this great City, at this day onely two old
towers doe survive, it being questionable, whether the place be


more ruinous, or the poor 
Moors
 more ragged, that dwell there∣in.
A bad haven, much obstructed with sands, and exposed to
the fury of the north wind. The best commendation of this har∣bour
is, that 
Iury
 had no better, scarce another, as if God con∣demned
the seacoasts thereof to danger, as the Continent to bar∣renness.


§ 7.
 Near unto 
Ioppa
 is 
Lydda
 (some six miles North-west)
where 
Peter
 cured 
En
as
 (truly 
pious
) of the palsie, which eight
years had afflicted him. Here Saint 
George
 is
 reported to have been
beheaded, and his tombe is shewed in this place. All I will adde
is (I hope without offence) this ensuing Parallel,





In 
Ioppa.


In
 Lydda.






The valour of
 
Perseus
 is celebra∣ted
for freeing 
Andromeda
 daugh∣ter
to King 
Cepheus,
 tyed with
chaines to the rockes,
 from the
fury of a sea monster to which she
was exposed.


The puissance of Saint 
George
 is
remembred for delivering the name∣less
and
 onely daughter of a cer∣tain
King of 
Libya,
 from a fiery
Dragon, to whom she was tendered
by lot, to be devoured.






It is pity these two stories should be parted asunder, which will
both in full latitude be believed together. Hard to say, whether
nearer, the two places, or two reports. He that considers the re∣semblance
of their complexions, will conclude, Fancy the father,
Credulity the mother of both; though we need not presently re∣ject
all the story of Saint 
George
 for fictitious for some improbable
circumstances appendent thereunto. Nor have I ought else to ob∣serve
of 
Lydda,
 save that in Saint 
Hieroms
 time it was called 
Dios∣polis.


§ 8. To return to 
Ioppa,
 the port of 
Ierusalem.
 And let us a
little way accompany the Pilgrims in the road thitherwards. Take
the character of the Countrey on the credit of a late
 eye-witness:

A most pleasant plain yeelding Tyme and Hyssope, and other fragrant herbs
without tillage or planting, growing so high, that they came to the knees of
our Asses.
 Nor need any wonder at the stature of this 
ground Hys∣sope

in 
Iury
 (different from 
wall-Hyssope
 or 
mosse
 rather, the last
and lowest step of natures storehouse, and
 
Solomons
 study) seeing
good
 Authors have affirmed, that 
haec planta in Iudaeâ arborescit,
hyssope doth tree it in Iudea.
 And what is called by
 
Matthew
 and

Mark Calamus,
 a reed, cane, or speare, is rendred an 
Hyssope-stalke

by
 Saint 
Iohn.
 Because as a learned man concludes, Hyssope here
sprouted so high, that thereof an instrument might be made to
lift up the sponge to our Saviours mouth hanging on the Cross.
And thus we see that as always one of 
Iob's
 messengers escaped,
to bring the sad tydings of their fellows destruction; so even at
this day, some stragling vallies in 
Palestine,
 have made hard shift


by their own fruitfulness still continuing) to informe the world,
how plentifull this Countrey was, before barrenness by Gods appoint∣ment,
seised on the generality thereof.


§ 9. To proceed in the road to 
Ierusalem
 (as the best guide to di∣rect
us in the survey of the north of this Tribe) It passeth not far
from 
Shaal
im
 a City of
 
Dan,
 but in the confines of 
Ephraim.

Where though the 
Amorites
 dwelt in despight of the 
Danites,
 yet the
Tribe of 
Ephraim
 made them tributaries. A little further, this high∣way
takes its farewell of the Tribe of 
Dan,
 but with full intent
shortly to visite it again. For having passed over a corner of

Ephraim,
 which baggeth into the south, it returns into 
Dan,

and goes forward by 
Modin,
 the City of 
Mattathias
 and his sons,
where the seven
 sepulchers of the 
Maccabees
 (each a high Pyra∣mid
on a square 
basis,
 and all mounted on a steep hill) are a
conspicuous sea-mark to the Mariners many miles distant. Chari∣table
monuments, which being erected for the honour of the
dead, are imployed for the safety of the living! Few miles
hence this high-way finally leaves this Tribe. And therefore
we leave it, onely wishing the passengers therein a prosperous
journey to 
Ierusalem.
 That such as goe thither about business may
dispatch the same to their own contentment; such as travell
out of curiosity may have their expectation so satisfied, as to coun∣tervaile
all their paines and charges: and such as goe thither out
of 
superstitious opinion to merit,
 may have their erroneous judgements
better rectified and informed.


§ 10. Nor doth ought else observable offer it self in this corner
of the Tribe, save
 
Aijalon,
 (where 
Ioshua's
 prayer arrested the
Moon to stand still) assigned by God to the 
Levites.
 But the 
Amo∣rites

took the boldness to keep possession thereof. Hear the words
of the
 Scripture, 
And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the
mountaines: for they would not suffer them to come down into the valley, but
the Amorites would dwell in mount Herez, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim.

The genuine sense is, that though the 
Amorites
 generally pent the

Danites
 up in the mountains; yet in these three places (though
mountainous in their situation) they crossed their common custome;
not out of necessity, but designe, as sensible of their own profit
that these transcended the vallies in fertility, and therefore placed
themselves therein. Let others dispute, how it came to pass, that
the 
Priests,
 whom God intended 
men of peace,
 by their profession,
had a controversiall City appointed them, incumbred with enemies
so that they must win it before they could wear it. As also how
the 
Levites
 could live, when the Land allotted them, was seque∣stred
in the hand of a forein foe. It will be for enough us to observe, that
in all ages the 
Church
 being imbarked in the same bottome with the



State
 ran an equall hazard therein, according to her proportion. And
when the whole Tribe of 
Dan,
 like the 
Parish in generall,
 was strait∣ned
in its processions, well might the 
Priests
 maintenance be abated
accordingly.


§ 11. We goe back now to 
Ioppa,
 where standing on the rocks,
an indifferent fight may easily discern those ships, into which the
heathen people of 
Ioppa,
 with much courtesie, but more craft,
invited the 
Iews
 with their wives and their children to goe aboard:
for they made them pay their lives the fraight for their voyage, wil∣fully
drowning two hundred of them. Whose bloud 
Maccabeus
 re∣venged
with a contrary, but as cruell an
 Element, burning all their
ships in their harbour, with such as were found therein. Hard by
is 
Iamnia,
 a little haven (which may be rendred 
Seaton
 in English)
whose mischievous intention against the 
Iews, Maccabeus
 punished
by
 burning their towne by night. Which bone-fire was beheld,
two hundred and fourty furlongs off, as far as 
Ierusalem.
 A thing
not incredible, that fire it self should be seen so far, by the light
whereof other things in darkness are discovered, especially when
mounted high on its throne, with the advantage of pitch, cordage,
and other navall and combustible matter.
 Some doe conceive that
this 
Iamnia
 is the same with 
Iabneh,
 the wall whereof was broken
down by
 
Uzziah
 the puissant King of 
Iudah.


§ 12. Hence the sea running southward provides it self to enter∣tain
a nameless brook: which 
Mercator
 cals 
Naphtoah,
 and
 others
(making signes, as unable to speak the true name thereof) 
the brook
of the land of the Philistines,
 because otherwhiles the northern boun∣dary
of their dominion. We had rather give it no name, then a
nick-name. And because the course thereof affords us conveniency
to visite the middle parts of this Tribe, we will accept of his cour∣tesie,
and follow the guidance thereof.


§ 13. This brook hath its birth and infancy in the Tribe of

Iudah,
 whence flowing into 
Dan,
 he runneth through the desert of

Modin,
 which is full of rocks, and those of holes, and those [once]
of men, flying out of the neighbouring Cities from the persecuti∣on
of the 
Pagans.
 Herein a thousand of them were slain by the
fury of their enemies, or rather by the fondness of their own su∣perstition,

 refusing to make resistance on the 
Sabbath day.
 A sad
accident. But the parent of a good event, because putting the sur∣viving

Iews
 in a posture of defence, and teaching them more wise
and valiant resolutions. Yea not long after, hereabouts they ob∣tained
a victory over the numerous army of
 
Cendebaeus.
 Nor will
any slight this brook as inconsiderable, when they read how it
ran in the midst betwixt the armies of the 
Iews
 and 
Pagans,
 and
was so deep, that the hardiest of the former durst not adventure


to wade it, before first incouraged by the example of their
 Gene∣rall.
Except any will say, they did not so much fear the depth of
the river, as the height of the banks of the other side, to wit, the
puissant army of their enemies.


§ 14. Going further on the river, we come into the Countrey
of 
Makats,
 that is (as learned
 
Tremelius
 well observeth) the bor∣der
or boundary (if you please, the 
Marches
) betwixt this Tribe and
their professed enemies the 
Philistines.
 It is impossible to define the
limits thereof, seeing the Countrey was the constant Cock-pit of
war: and the ground thereof, sometimes marched forward, some∣times
retreated backward, according to the variety of martiall suc∣cess.
Great is the difference betwixt the same sea, at 
high and low water
mark:
 and so this Countrey must needs be much disproportioned to it
self, when extended in a 
full tyde,
 and when contracted in a 
low
ebbe
 of success.


§ 15. In this Countrey of 
Makats Bethshemesh
 was a principall
City, belonging to the 
Levites,
 and reputed part of 
Iudah,
 but (except
some Labell of land tacked to 
Iudah
) surrounded about with the
Tribe of 
Dan.
 A case obvious in the dividing of Countreys. Who knows
not how 
Worcester-shire
 hath speckled all the adjacent Counties with
snips and shreds belonging unto it, though environed with other
shires, and that at considerable distance? Hither the kine drawing the
Cart, and lowing as they went to their Calves at home, (nature in
them was not rooted out, but overruled) brought the 
Arke,
 and rested
it near a great stone in the field of
 
Ioshua
 a 
Bethshemite.
 At what▪
time the 
Bethshemites
 were reaping their harvest in the valley. Instant∣ly
at so good news, their Sicles lost their edges, and could cut no
more corn that day. The 
Arke-home
 is to be preferred before 
Har∣vest-home.

But oh! how hard is it to keep hungry eyes from feeding
on forbidden objects! All the 
Bethshemites
 were 
Levites,
 but not

Priests,
 much less 
high-Priests:
 to whom alone (and that onely anni∣versary)
the survey of those mysteries did belong. Besides at this
time 
Bethshemesh
 from a City, was enlarged to be a Countrey:
(such the confluence of 
Israelites
 from all places) Otherwise no back
of one City might seem broad enough for so great a rode,
 where∣by
fifty thousand and threescore and ten men were destroyed by the
Plague, for their Curiosity, in prying into the 
Arke.


§ 16. 
Gibbethon
 is another prime place in 
Makats:
 allotted by God
to the
 
Levites
 of 
Kohath,
 and no doubt by them peaceably possessed
for many years, seeing nothing to the contrary doth appear. But after
the days of 
Ieroboam
 it is said to
 belong to the 
Philistines.
 Probably,
when the 
Levites
 loyall both to God and their King, upon the idola∣trous
defection of 
Israel,
 willingly
 deserted their own Cities, the

Philistines
 taking advantage thereof (when much good bloud is let out,


bad humours are nimble to supply the place) seised on this City. To
recover the same, 
Nadab
 the son of 
Ieroboam
 besieged it: but was so
far from taking the City, that before it he lost his own life, by the treche∣ry
of 
Baasha
 conspiring against him. This siege continued more then
twenty years, (no doubt with intervalls of cessation) for
 here 
Om
i
 a
great Commander was in service, when by the souldiery voted King of

Israel.
 After which election he had not so much minde to take the 
City,
 as
a 
Crown,
 vigorously to prosecute his new title, and to suppress 
Tib
 his
Corrivall. So much of the siege, but nothing of the taking of 
Gib∣bethon,

so that it was still violently possessed by the 
Philistines.


§ 17. The south-east part of this Tribe is still to survey.
 Where the
brook 
Zorek
 creeps faintly out of the Tribe of 
Iudah.
 Not far from
whose banks we light on 
Zorah
 and 
Eshtaol:
 two twin-cities, the one
seldome mentioned in Scripture without the other. Except one will call
them man and wife: because 
Machaneh-Dan
 (betwixt 
Zorah
 and 
Eshta∣ol
)
was joint issue of them both. For when six hundred men out of these
two cities marched towards the taking of 
Leshem,
 here they
 met (pro∣bably
by mutuall agreement the most convenient place betwixt them)
behind (that is, west) of 
Kiriath-jearim.
 These did call this the first
place of their station 
Machaneh-Dan;
 and the last 
Dan
 (both from 
Dan

their Ancestour) without naming any intermediate places. As in all
undertaking, the first motion which founds and the last which fini∣sheth
it, are most memorable. It seems that afterwards, a town was
built in that place, where their tents were pitched, as a fortunate ground
handselled with good success, where
 
Samson
 seems to have had his
education.


§ 18. But his birth at 
Zorah.
 Where he was the son of a long bar∣ren
mother (a regiment in Scripture of such eminent Persons, 
Isaac,
Iacob, Samuel, Samson, Iohn Baptist &c.
) as if (besides higher causes) na∣ture
had long thriftily reserved her utmost strength, to expend it at last
with more credit. Here an Angel appearing to 
Manoahs
 wife, both
 told
her that she should be a mother, and taught her how she should be a
nurse; with the ceremonious breeding of her son. No 
Wine must come
in, no rasor on him. Hercules
 the 
Pagan-Samson
 in some sort may seem, by
the luxury of Poets wits, to 
ape
 this 
Iewish Hercules.
 Neither of them
otherwise mounted, then on their legs: otherwise defensively armed,
then with their skin and clothes. A 
aw-bone
 a sword to the one, a 
Club,

to the other. Both of them very like for their valour, and too like for
their wantonness, women being the destruction of them both.


§ 19. But as 
Samsons
 lustre did rise, so it did set in this Tribe. Here∣abouts
born and
 buried in the grave of his Father 
Manoah,
 betwixt

Zorah
 and 
Eshtaol.
 Reader, let me invite thee with me solemnly to be∣hold
his sepulchre, that therein both of us may bury all our vain thoughts
of eternity here. He that hereafter shall presume on his own might as


immortall, hath not stronge
 brains, but a weak
 back then 
Sam∣son.


§ 20. To goe back to 
,
 which now grows confident and bold
with the accession of the brook 
,
 so named (as 
the vine
 in 
Hamp∣shire
)
from bunches of grapes there growing, whereof one was the load
for two men. Surely 
Bac
hus
 
id not so drown 
Ceres
 in this Countrey,
nor did God the wise 
master of the feast,
 entertain the 
Iews
 his daily
guests, with suc
 liquid diet, but that we may justly presume the land
afforded bread and meat in a plentifull proportion to their wine. But
when the spies brought this home to the camp of the 
Israelites
 at 
Kadesh∣barnea,

they like
 the wine, but not the reckoning which was to be paid
for it▪ not so pleased with the bigness of the grapes, as frighted at the
bulkes of the Giants.


§ 21. Nor is there any other considerable City remaining in this
Tribe, save 
Tim
ah,
 where 
Iudah
 sheared his sheep, and at 
Pethah-enaim
 (or

the opening of the ways
) committed incest with 
Thamar
 his unknown
daughter-in-law, whom after wards he commanded to be brought forth
and
 burnt. Thus easier i
 
s for one to cause another to be consumed
to ashes, then to quench the least spark of lust in our own soul. After∣wards

Samson
 going with his Parents to wooe his wife, killed
a young Lion in the vineyards of 
Timnah,
 and the
 text saith, 
he told
not his Father or 
other what he had done.
 Herein his silence no less commen∣dable
then his valour. But indeed true prowess pleaseth it self more in
doing then reporting its own atchievements.
 Not long after the Bees
made a hive of the Lions body. And did not this land 
flow with honey,

when it was powred into a carkass for want of other vessells to receive
it? Honey which in fine proved gall to the 
Philistines.
 For though they
read his riddle 
by plowing with his heifer,
 he payed his forfeit by killing
their Countrey men. Hence afterwards 
Samson,
 to revenge the injuries
offered unto him, sent forth his 
Foxes,
 which proved incendiaries of
the corn and grain of the 
Philistines.


§ 22. So much for the places of this Tribe, of whose situation we
have any certainty from Gods word, or good Authors. On the rest we
hang out our conjecturall Flag. Which whilest some censure for the
Ensignes of our ignorance; others I hope will approve as the colours
of our modesty. Especially having done our best endevour in ranking
them; and in default of demonstrations, the most probability hath ever
been accounted the next heir apparent to Truth. The best is, such places
are onely of name, not of note; but once mentioned in
 
Ioshua,
 with∣out
any memorable actions done in them, and so any mistake in the
false posture will prove less dangerous. Mountains of eminency this
Tribe affords none, save
 mount 
Seir
 (puny hills far different from those
in 
Edom
) and mount
 
Baalah.
 Both parcels of the south-west bounds
of 
Iudah,
 as originally they were assigned. But seeing those limits were


afterward discomposed by a new division and re-assignment of them to
this Tribe (the out-list of 
Iudah
 fell into the midst of 
Dans
 whole cloth)
those antiquated borders are 
 the less remarkable. And as for
other mountains, although this whole was mountainous, yet there was a
parity in her hills, none exceeding high▪ one
 such advantages of ground
swelling above the plain, seemed to be the 
full breasts
 and 
fair nipples
 of
that land, 
which flowed with milke and honey.


§ 23. A fair reserve of land in, not of, the Tribe, is still behind, long
expecting our company to come and describe it; namely; 
Philistia,
 or a
part of 
the land of the Philistines.
 These were a warlike people; none of
the seven nations of the 
Canaanites,
 which God drave out before 
Israel,
 but
descended from
 
Mi
zraim,
 the son of 
Cham.
 In the race of military at∣chievements,
they started with the first, ran with the swiftest, and held
out with the longest. Having a
 King in the days of 
Abraham,
 and con∣tinuing
themselves in a considerable condition till after the captivity. Re∣turning
almost as many forcible impressions, as they received from the

Israelites.
 What though
 
Sh
gar
 smote, 
Samson
 
, and
 
Samuel

humbled them? yet they grew so great in the reigne of 
Saul,
 that they
left all the 
Israelites
 swordles
: though afterwards there was one
sword too many in 
Saul
 hand, wherewith he slew himself when over∣come
by the 
Philistines.
 Indeed
 
David
 brought them, and 
Solomon
 kept
them under. But in the days of 
Ioram
 they so recovered themselves, that
they plundered 
Iudah,
 rifled the Kings palace,
 killed and carried captive
the 
seed royall. Uzziah
 after ordered them into obedience
. but under 
Ahaz

they regnined their lost cities, and wan more unto them. In a word;
of the heathen people left for
 thornes in the sides of the 
Iewes,
 none had
sharper prickles
 or pierced nearer to their hearts then the 
Philistines.
 Yea
such their puissance, that from them the 
Greeks
 and 
Latinos
 called all this
land 
Palestina
 because the 
Philistines
 lived on the sea-coast most obvious to
the notice of foreiners. As in deed a small Port makes a greater report
in the eares of strangers far off, then a land-locked place though far grea∣ter
in proportion.


§ 24. The bounds of 
Philistia
 are not precisely to be set down. For
whilest tame cattell are kept in pastures, beasts of prey (such this war∣like
people) are onely bounded by their own ravenous appetite. The
best way to measure the borders of the 
Philistines
 is to behold the sins of
the 
Israelites.
 For when they were encreased, then the Countrey of the

Philistines.
 was accordingly enlarged. Thus in the days of King 
Saul

they roved, and
 ranged as far as 
Dor
 and 
Bethshean
 in the half Tribe of

Manasseh,
 and had Garisons in the heart of most Tribes of 
Israel.
 But
their constant habitation (their den, as I may terme it) was atract of
ground from 
Gath
 in the north to 
Gaza
 in the south. Some fifty miles
in length and about halfe as broad, in the lands allotted to 
Iudah, Dan,

and 
Simeon.
 Their government was a mixture of Monarchy, and Aristo∣cracy.


For as their chiefe Cities had Kings over them, which seem abso∣lute
in their own dominions; so these kingdomes were but 
Cantons

in relation to the whole, as members making up one entire Common∣wealth.


§ 25. There need no other evidence be produced to prove the fruit∣fulness
of their Countrey, then the vastness of their bodies, whereof
the rankness of their ground must be allowed a partiall cause. Our Eng∣lish
Proverb saith, 
shew me not the meate, but shew me the man.
 The well
batling of the Giants bred in 
Philistia
 (chiefly in 
Gath
 their Seminary)
being Heteroclites,
 redundants from the rules of nature, sufficiently attests
the fertility of their soil. Some of these Giants had their hands branching
out into
 six fingers, though they who had one fewer had enough to kill
them. Let Naturalists curiously inquire, whether or no 
this stock of Giants

be wholly spent in our age. And if so, what the true causes thereof.
Whether intemperance of diet, or over early marriage; seeing every
one that is raw to work, count themselves ripe to wed. Let them con∣sult
whether nature hath not some other way recompensed in our age
that want of strength, by giving them quicker wits; wheras in volu∣minous
men commonly there is much empty margent. However
mens lesser strength and stature amounts not to a proof of an universall
decay in nature,

as a most learned pen hath unanswerably demon∣strated.


§ 26. One thing more we must observe of the 
Philistines,
 that they
are also called 
Cherethims
 or 
Cherethites
 in
 Scripture. Know also that the

 
Cherethites
 were a kind of 
lifegard
 to King 
David.
 Now because it is
improbable that so wise a Prince would intrust his 
Person
 in the pro∣tection
of the 
Philistines
 his conquered enemies: therefore learned

 
Tremellius
 by 
Cherethites
 understands such 
Israelites
 as afterwards posses∣sed
the Countrey of the 
Philistines
 expulsed by 
David.
 Which seems to
some but a forced interpretation. For what unlikelyhood was it, that

David
 might entertain 
Proselyte Philistines,
 converts to the 
Iewish
 religion,
if there were such, to be attendants about his body? Not to instance in
the 
French Kings
 double gard of 
Scots,
 and 
Switzars,
 as improper to this
purpose; (because though forein, yet free and friendly nations;) 
David

out of policy might retain such to wait upon him, both for their pre∣sent
encouragement, and future engagements of the fidelity of the 
Phi∣listines.

Whose service might not onely be free from danger, but full of
advantage, especially when they were under the conduct of so wise and
valiant an 
Israelite
 as
 
Benajah
 the son of 
Iehojada
 placed governour o∣ver
them. To render this still more probable: Consider how 
Ittai
 the

Gittite,
 with six hundred men of 
Gath,
 was no native of 
Israel,
 as ap∣pears
by 
Davids
 words,
 
thou art a stranger and an exile;
 and yet was in∣trusted
with the Command of a
 
Terce
 of the army, in the battell a∣gainst

Absolom.
 Wherein he excellently acquitted himself according to


his loyall resolution to attend the Kings fortunes whether in life or
death.


§ 27. Come we now to describe the Countrey 
Philistia,
 where in
the north part thereof, we finde 
Gath
 a regall City:
 before 
Achish
 the son
of 
Maoch
 the King whereof, 
David
 to save his life counterfeited himself
mad. But whether guilty or no in so doing, Divines have not yet de∣termined.
It would incline me to the more charitable side, that he had
good warrant for what he did, because at the same time (understand it
immediately before or after) he composed
 two Psalmes. Which shew
his soul not out of tune solemnly to serve God. But 
David
 went to 
Achish

a second time, with sixe hundred men; (it seems upon better assurance
before-hand, then formerly) and was with great kindness entertained
by him, dwelt with him in 
Gath,
 and after obtained 
Ziklag
 from him;
and by 
Achish
 his minde should have been the
 keeper of his head. 
Achish

the son of 
Maachah
 (tributary no doubt to 
Solomon
) was King of 
Gath.
 For

Shimei
 confined to 
Hierusalem
 by 
Solomons
 command, and his own con∣sent,
did fetch from
 him his fugitive servants. Time was when 
Shi∣mei's


 tongue ran too fast in railing on 
David
 his Master, and now his
feet moved too far in running after his servants, so that breaking the

Tedder of his Commission,
 of the pieces thereof a 
Halter
 was justly made for
his execution. This City of
 
Gath
 was afterwards fortified by 
Reho∣boam,

and many years after taken
 by 
Hazael
 King of 
Syria,
 and in the
next age had the wall thereof broken down by 
Uzziah
 King of


Israel.


§ 28. Betwixt 
Gath
 and 
Ekron
 (lying thence south west) we are as
certain there were Cities as ignorant how to call them. For the present
let them pass by the name of 
Samuels Cities:
 because by his 
devotion, the
Cities, which the Philistines had taken from Israel, were restored to Israel from
 E∣kron
even unto Gath.
 See the difference betwixt 
Priest
 and 
Priest,
 both in
service and success. Vicious 
Hophni
 brings forth the 
Arke
 into the field,
fights, falls, loseth his own life, and part of 
Israels
 Land to the 
Philistines.

Pious 
Samuel
 stays and prays at home; the 
Arke
 is brought back to him:
he both saves himself, and as a bountifull benefactor regaineth the for∣mer
loss of his Countrey.


§ 29. 
Ekron
 was a stately City; and commendable was the discre∣tion
of her 
Inhabitants,
 who learning wit from their neighbours woe,
would not keep the
 
Arke
 and Gods anger therein, but with the speedi∣est
conveniency returned it home to 
Bethshemes.
 Of these 
Ekronites, Da∣vid

afterward killed 
two hundred,
 and tendered their Foreskins a Dowry
for 
Michal Sauls
 daughter. For, though by the condition of his Espousals
he contracted but for an
 hundred Foreskins, yet such was the supere∣rogation
of his valour (Love and Loyalty never give scant measure)
that he
 doubled the number. And what injustice was it that he that
paid her dowry double should enjoy her but halfe? seeing 
Saul
 after∣wards


took her away, and 
gave her to
 another. Beelzebub
 was the grand
Idoll of
 
Ekron,
 whose name importeth 
a Lord of flies. Scaliger
 con∣ceiving
it to be a nick-name which the 
Iews
 gave it in derision, so that
the terming it 
a God of flies,
 was in effect to say, 
a flie for your God.
 In
the new Testament 
Beelzebub
 passeth for the
 
Prince of the Devills.
 It seems
that Hell it self, that place of confusion, would wholly be confounded, if
some superiority were not therein observed.


§ 30. More south we again come to the river 
Sorek,
 on whose
banks grew 
Grapes
 of goodly greatness; yea the 
Hebrews
 report them
to have been without any
 kernels. But that hereabouts Lust did not
grow without shame and sorrow to attend it, 
Samson
 will sadly wit∣ness.
For in the house of 
Dalilah
 by the 
brook of
 Sorek,
 he betrayed
his strength to her, she his person to the 
Philistines.
 Thus those that
sleep on a harlots lap for their Pillow, are overtaken with destructi∣on
before they dream thereof. Hence they carried 
Samson
 to
 
Gaza,

which is welnigh fourty miles off. And why so far? Partly to ren∣der
their triumph more glorious, baiting him with all eyes gazing
on him, and partly the more safely to secure him, bringing him far
from his friends, and beyond the reach of any rescue.


§ 31. But as here was the place where 
Samsons
 purity was pollu∣ted,
so hard by was the the fountain or water wherein the 
Ethiopians

pollution was purified. This was he, who being Treasurer to 
Can∣dace

Queen of 
Ethiopia,
 rode in his chariot and read 
Isaias,
 when,
(always some unexpected good surprizeth such as are studious in the
Scripture)
 
Philip
 was sent to expound it unto him. 
Can a
 Blacka∣more
change his skin,
 saith the Prophet? But see here the virtue of

baptismall water,
 washing away the black hue, and vicious habits of
his naturall Corruption, and making him a true Christian con∣vert.


§ 32. 
But Philip was found at Azotus:
 and 
Azotus
 or 
Ashd
d
 hardby is easily
found, 
(for a City seated on a Hill cannot be hid.
) This was the third 
Satrapie
 of
the 
Philistines,
 in our definition, but first in honour, as famous for 
Dagon

an 
Idol
 there adored: who yet had the manners in homage to the 
Arke
 to
put off his head and hands, and fall flat on the ground; And hither first
they brought the 
Arke
 of God
. This was allotted to the Tribe of 
Iu∣dah
; but left unconquered by 
Ioshua.
 King 
Uzziah
 brake down
the wall of it: and built Cities in the coast of it
. And soon after

Tartan
 sent by 
Sargon
 King of 
Assyria,
 took it
. The 
Maccabees
 had
divers battells near 
Azotus.
 Here 
Iudas
 overthrows 
Gorgias
, And
spoiles 
Azotus
; And again pursues 
Bacchides.
 But himself is slain
. Here

Ionathan
 overcomes 
Demetrius
 the younger, and burns 
Azotus;
 and the
Temple of 
Dagon
; And hereabouts 
Iudas
 and 
Iohn
 prevaile against

 
Cendebeus.
 As for 
Dagon
 here adored, some make him 
Patron of grain,

(and he is translated 
 by 
Philo Biblius
) others the President of the


sea; and we may safely beleeve his Power as much over the one as
the other. His shape (save that it was 
masculine for sexe
) resembled the

Antick
 laughed at by the Poet.

Desinit in piscem, mulier formosa supernè.


Upwards man-like he ascended,


Downwards like a fish he ended.


And yet this 
Fish
 had also
 feet under the 
taile
 thereof,
 which
feet of 
a fish
 seem not to stand with any proportion. But what
shall we say? The uglier his shape, the handsomer for an 
Idol;
 and
to keep a 
Decorum,
 it was fit that he should be as mishapen in his
form, as monstrous in his worship. Far handsomer no doubt
were the women of 
Ashdod,
 or else the 
Israelites
 would never have
been so enamoured with them, as after their return from the ca∣ptivity,
by marrying with them to beget a mongrell off-spring,
whose tongues (as if divided 
Parte per Pale
) spake half
 
Ashdod
 and half

Hebrew.
 But surely God was afterwards better pleased with the

Iews
 solemn submission, and fair putting away of their wives,
then with the cruelty of the 
Britons
 (if true what
 reported) which
marrying 
French
 women in 
Armorica
 (now called 
little Britain
) out
of a zeale to preserve their native Language, they cut out their
wives tongues for fear they should infect their children with a
mixture of 
French.
 As for
 
Metheg-Ammah
 in 
Philistia,
 because the
learned are not resolved whether thereby a place be designed;
and if so, many take it for 
Gath;
 or else that thereby is signified,
that 
David
 took the 
Bridle of Power,
 from the hand of the 
Phili∣stines;

see it signed with an Asteriske, enough to tell the Reader,
that we doe not shew, but seek a certainty therein.


§ 33. So much for the land in this Tribe.
 If we look on the
sea, bounding it on the west, see 
Ionah
 in his ship, flying as fast
as he could,
 
from the presence of the Lord,
 that is, from the 
per∣formance
of his Propheticall function
 in 
Niniveh.
 Otherwise he was bet∣ter
principled then to conceive it probable, in any place to avoid

Gods presence;
 and (if so erroneously opinioned) made the worst
of choices,
 
to goe down into the sea,
 where Divine power most effe∣ctually
appears. Many carnall reasons might cause his flight; as,

fear to he murthered
 for delivering so unwelcome a message to that


bloody City; suspicion,
 that his preaching little regarded in 
Israel,

would be less in 
Niniveh; zeal to his Countrey,
 as perceiving the
conversion of the 
Gentiles,
 would prove the rejection of the 
Iews;

and a 
Iealousie
 (as himself
 confesseth) his Prophesie should be dis∣proved
on the peoples repentance.



A terrible tempest persuing the ship,
 works wonders in the ma∣riners:



1 Out of the bold came fear; 
They were
 afraid.


2 Out of the profane came piety; 
Cryed every man to his God.


3 Out of the covetous prodigality;

Cast their ware into the sea.



Mean time 
Ionah
 was fast asleep in the botome of the ship. It is
hard to make sense of his actions, his flight spake fear, his
sleeping shewed security; 
formidat & audet.
 How doth sin distract
men, making them as contrary to themselves, as to Gods com∣mandements!


§ 34. At last, the Master of the ship (now vassall to the winds)
awakes him; and 
Ionah
 detected by lot, and his guilty▪ conscience,
is cast as a 
peace offering
 into the sea, where a Whale is provided,
after three days to bring him safe to the shore; who amongst ma∣ny

Land-types,
 was the onely 
Sea-type
 (as the
 Serpent the 
Aire-type
)
of our
 Saviour.


§ 35. The son of 
Dekar
 was 
Solomons
 purveyour in 
Machats,

and in 
Shaalbim,
 and 
Bethshemesh,
 and 
Elon-Bethanan,
 all places in
or near this Tribe. The Armes vulgarly assigned to 
Dan,
 are 
Vert
a Snake or adder argent nowed,
 b
ting, as some adde, (let Heralds
translate it into the proper terms of Blazonry) the heels of an horse,
whereby the Cavalier mounted on him falls down backwards.
All grounded on the
 Blessing of 
Iacob;
 intimating the slie and
subtile disposition of the 
Danites,
 whose sleight was above their
might, policy more then their power, verified in their sodain and
unexpected surprisall of the City of 
Laish.
 Nor know I how here∣in
to reconcile the particular fancy of 
Aben Ezra
 to this received
opinion, who allots an Eagle for the armes of 
Dan:
 a creature
of most contrary posture and practise to a Snake: (nothing creeps
lower then the one, or soares higher then the other) except
agreeing in the generall qualities of quick-sight and subtilty. Here if
some say that the Eagle might have been the crest of 
Dan,
 they
will quickly retract their opinion, considering crests a modern de∣vice,
and could not be born in that age, which was scarce conceived
three hundred years since. The standard of 
Dan
 was erected formost
of the three on the north side of the Tabernacle.








Here the Map of 
Simeon
 is to be inserted.












THE TRIBE OF SIMEON. CHAP. 11.


§ 1. 
S
IMEON
 second son of 
Iacob
 by 
Leah
 his wife
probably was active in the persecution of his
brother 
Ioseph;
 (therefore singled out in


Egypt
 to be a prisoner) certainly imbrued his
hands with 
Levi
 in the bloud of the
 
Sheche∣mites:

Whereupon 
Iacob
 jointly cursed them,


I will divide them in Iacob, and scatter them in
Israel.
 Which prediction took a threefold effect in this Tribe, namely
in their



1 Paucity. Scarce any Tribe came
 
more
 out of 
Egypt,
 not any by
much entred fewer into 
Canaan.
 So sensible was their diminu∣tion,
that of fifty
nine thousand, but twenty two thousand two
hundred possessed their inheritance. It seemeth that the many mor∣talities
in the wilderness did light heavy on the 
Simeonites.
 Yea
after they were setled in their possessions, the Text saith, 
they had


not many children, neither did all their family multiply, like to the children
of Iudah.
 And although
 immediately after it is recorded,

that the house of their Fathers increased greatly;
 yet the proportion
is to be measured, not in relation of this to other Tribes, but in
the reference of these families to others in the same Tribe of

Simeon.


2 Obscurity. Neither Judge nor Prophet extracted from this
Tribe: save that in this dearth of eminent persons (famine
will make those crums to be taken up, which otherwise would
be cast away) we must take in
 
Iudith,
 with her 
Apocrypha
 atchieve∣ments.
But most sure it is that one notoriously infamous,
namely
 
Zimri,
 the son of 
Salu,
 who defied justice, and boldly
avouched his adultery with a woman of 
Midian,
 was son to a
Prince of 
Simeon.


3 Dispersedness. Their Countrey was but a jagged Remnant ori∣ginally
belonging to, and still surrounded with
 
Iudah
 on all
sides, save on the sea, amongst whom their townes were scat∣tered.




§ 2. Yet in process of time, as the dispersion of the 
Levites
 was tur∣ned
totally, so the scattering of the 
Simeonites
 was changed partially into
a blessing. Their locall mixture with 
Iudah
 begate a politicall confede∣racy
with them,
 
Come up with me into my lot, and likewise I will goe with thee
into thy lot.
 Whence a double benefit accrued to the 
Simeonites.




1 Spirituall: they were hedged in by their habitation, in the right
way of Gods worship: so that, when the ten Tribes made their
idolatrous defection under 
Ieroboam,
 many of the 
Simeonites

persevered in Gods true service: 
and they fell to King Asa in
 
abun∣dance.


2 Temporall. When the rest of their brethren were finally car∣ried
away captive under 
Hoshed
 in the sixth year of the reign of
King 
Hezekiah,
 probable it is that a considerable number of the

Simeonites
 remained, as hath been proved before, by their habita∣tion
within the lot of 
Iudah.




§ 3. The Lot of 
Simeon
 was transcendently fruitfull▪ having a most
temperate aire, insomuch that Saint 
Hierome
 
, in his time it was
termed 
Regio salutaris,
 the 
healthy Countrey.
 No marvell then if the Patri∣archs

Abraham
 and 
Isaac
 having their choice of the whole Countrey, pre∣ferred
to live so long in these parts. And the latter of them sowing grain
near 
Gerar reaped
 
an hundred fold,
 which was the greatest increase which
that Corn returned, which fell into 
good ground,
 in the
 Gospell.


§ 4. In the north-east corner of this Tribe we find
 that mountain
before 
Hebron,
 to the
 top whereof, full twenty miles from the City,

Samson
 carried the gates of 
Azzah.
 There he laid them down, not in a
plain but steep place, partly in the gallantry of his strength, that not
faintness, but his free pleasure made him lay them down, and partly, that
in so conspicuous a place the 
Gazites
 might easier finde their gates there,
then fetch them thence. A little more westward, not far from the banks
of the river 
Sorek,
 stood the City 
Ziglag,
 which
 
A
hish
 King of 
Gath,

bestowed on 
David
 during his abode there. If any demand why 
David,

when King of 
Israel,
 did not restore 
Ziglag
 to 
Achish
 again; let such
know, that (besides that Cities once passed into a potent hand, are too
precious things to be parted with) 
David
 being crowned King of 
Israel

had an undoubted right derived unto him by Gods grant, not onely to
this City, but to the whole Kingdome of 
Gath,
 and land of the 
Philistines,

which God had given to 
Iudah,
 though hitherto they were not able to re∣cover
it.


§ 5. Afterwards, whilest 
David
 was marching (at least wise in pre∣sence)
with 
Achish
 against 
Saul,
 the 
Amalekites
 in his absence burnt 
Ziglag,



carrying away all the people therein captive. Griefe hereat so prevailed
in 
Davids
 men at their return, that in anguish of their hearts, they were
ready to
 stone him. Could better be expected from them? Behold
their originall, they were at first,
 
men in debt and distress,
 whose severall
discontents made them generally contented to join together; so that
not 
David,
 but his necessities chose them to attend him, who now in ad∣versity
discovered their impious dispositions. But 
David
 to avoid this
showre of stones ready to rain upon him, run for shelter to 
God
 his 
Rock,

in whom he 
comforted himself.
 Thus, as it is always darkest just before
the Day dawneth, so God useth to visite his servants with greatest affli∣ctions,
when he intendeth their speedy advancement. For immediate∣ly
after, 
David
 not onely recovered his loss with advantage, but also was
proclaimed 
King of Israel:
 though some war arose for a time between
him and 
Ishbosheth.


§ 6. But the most memorable places of this Tribe are seated on or
near the brook of 
Bezor,
 which arising in 
Iudah
 takes his course south∣west,
not far from
 
Ethar
 or
 
Etan
 in the north-east corner of this Tribe.
In the rock of
 
Etan
 near the City of that name 
Samson
 reposed himself,
whence the men of 
Iudah
 brought him down, bound with two cords,
and delivered him to the 
Philistines:
 but he presently found his spirits,
and in that place the jaw-bone of an Asse. Bad weapons are better
then none; and it matters not what they be, so that they be
weilded by 
Samsons
 arme, that, guided by Gods hand. This jaw-bone
which used to feed on grass, here eat up a
 thousand men. Hereupon
the place was called 
Rama-Lehi, the lifting up of a jawbone.


§ 7. Thus 
Samsons
 thirst of revenge was allayed with the bloud of the

Philistines,
 but the quenching of one thirst was the kindling of another.
How quickly can God tame fury into faintness with want of water!
In this straight he hath his recourse by prayer to God, who
 
cleaves a hol∣low
place in the jaw.
 Heaven can make 
dry bones
 
live,
 yea give life to others,
as here to 
Samson,
 water presently flowing out thereof. Let poets fondly
brag of 
Hippocrene,
 a fountain from a horses hoof; most true it is that a
spring did flow from the jawbone of an Asse. Except any be pleased
(which indeed is most probable) not to take 
Lehi
 in Hebrew for the ma∣teriall
jaw-bone, but for the Countrey thereabouts, so newly named by

Samson,
 out of a hollow place of the earth whereof, God produced this
fountain.


§ 8. Hence 
Bezor
 runneth by 
Ain,
 the onely City belonging to
the
 
Levites,
 in this Tribe. Indeed both
 
Simeon
 and 
Levi
 were cursed
to be scattered in 
Israel,
 and this City of the 
Levites
 scattered in 
Simeon,

may seem to be 
dispersed
 in a 
dispersion.
 One City it seems was pro∣portionable
to this small and mangled Tribe. Thus even the poorest
must have some Preachers to instruct them, and afford those Preachers
maintenance for their instruction. At 
Gerar,
 the brook 
Bezor
 receives


from the south a Tributary rivolet, fetching its fountain out of the wil∣derness
of 
Kadesh,
 a place full of strong and stately trees. But what saith
the
 Psalmist? 
The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness, yea the Lord shaketh
the wilderness of Kadesh.
 As if this of all other was most sturdy and stub∣born
to withstand the summons of Gods voice: but all in vain, the least
whisper of his mouth sending a palsey into the foundations thereof.


§ 9. In the confines of this wilderness stood three remarkable Cities,
which (lest the Reader should mistake) we have marked with circles
on the tops of them. Not that any evill spirits moved therein, seeing
these were the places 
where David haunted,
 whilest 
Saul
 persecuted him,
and to whose inhabitants he sent part of his spoile taken from the 
Ama∣lekites

for a present. An act no less politick then just, with the same both
discharging the shot of his former entertainment, and for the future ob∣liging
them by his bounty to be really sensible of his right of succession
to the Crown. The first of these
 
Corashan
 (
 elsewhere onely called

Ashan.
)
 The second
 
South-Ramoth,
 and
 
Hormah
 the last and most ob∣servable,
because of three eminent places of that name in or near the

Land of Canaan,




1
 Where the disobedient 
Israelites
 were destroyed by the 
Canaanites.


2 Where the 
Canaanites
 were destroyed by the penitent
 
Israelites.


3 Where the Tribes of
 
Iudah
 and 
Simeon
 associating together de∣stroyed
the 
Canaanites,
 being properly in this Tribe.



We see that 
destruction
 (so 
Hormah
 soundeth in Hebrew) gives the name
to them all. And wonder not then, that in a Countrey the Seat of
war, there were so many towns of this sad denomination, but pray ra∣ther
that God would seasonably settle a peace in 
England,
 lest therein be
found more 
Hormahs
 then were in 
Israel.


§ 10. As for 
Gerar
 the City above mentioned, it was anciently a
kingdome of the 
Philistines,
 whose Kings seem all to be called 
Abimelech's.

To one of these 
Abraham
 falsely affirmed that 
Sarah
 his wife was his

sister: and afterwards 
Isaac
 (see the powerfull influence of Parents
faults on their childrens practise!) to another of the same name offended
in the like falshood. This latter 
Abimelech
 looking out of his window,
beheld 
Isaac
 
sporting with Rebekah,
 (gestures not unlawfull as done, but as
seen) and from this familiarity (greater his charity then 
Isaacs
 caution
therein) interpreted her to be not his harlot, but his wife.


§ 11. Afterwards 
Isaac
 outed of the City dwelt in the neighbouring
valley of 
Gerar,
 and whithersoever he removed, Gods blessing, and the

Philistines
 envy followed him. He grew fat in estate, his enemies lean at
the fight thereof, which made them spitefully stop the
 wells which
his Father had digged. Happy that they could neither dam up nor drain
dry the dew of Divine blessing, from falling upon him, which, if
possible to effect, their malice would have attempted. But 
Isaac
 after∣wards
sunk these wells the second time, and 
he
 
called their names after the


names by which his Father had called them.
 See his humility herein, not vary∣ing
from his Fathers will in an indifferent matter, whereas many now
adays count it the greatest honour of this age, in all things to diffent
from the former. Besides these renewed wells, 
Isaac
 had new ones of
his own making, as namely



1
 
Esech:
 that is 
stri
e,
 so called because his heardmen, and the 
Gera∣rites

strove about it.


2
 
Sitnah,
 that is 
hatred,
 so named on the like occassion.


3
 
Rekoboth,
 that is 
enlargement,
 which he peaceably possessed;

God making room for him.



The two former pass for the emblems of our militant condition in
this life, the last typyifieth our happy estate in a better, and more room∣thy
place; 
In my Fathers house there be many
 
mansions.


§ 12. This vale of 
Gerar
 was the Granary of 
Canaan,
 whither the
Patriarchs retired in time of famine; for plenty dwelt there, when
penury was elsewhere. Nor will it be amiss to insert the testimony of a

Modern traveller, to shew how the Countrey hereabouts, even at this
day, retains an indeleble character of its former fruitfulness. 
We passed
this day through the most pregnant and pleasant valley, that ever eye beheld. On the
right hand a ridge of high mountains (whereon stands Hebron) on the left hand
the Mediterranean Sea bordered with continued hills, beset with variety of fruits.
The Champion between about twenty miles over, full of flowry hills ascending leasure∣ly,
and not much surmounting their ranker vallies, with groves of Olives and other
fruits dispersedly adorned. Yet is this wealthy Bottome (as are all the rest) for the
most part uninhabited.


§ 13. From the vale of 
Gerar
 the brook 
Berzor
 runneth by the grove
near 
Beersheba,
 planted by 
Abraham
 for the more convenient perfor∣mance
of his devotion. Collect we hence that 
Abraham
 resided some
considerable time in these parts, seeing trees grow not up as 
Ionas his
gourd
 in a night, but must have some competent season to come to ma∣turity.
But what was piety in 
Abraham
 in planting this grove, was pro∣faneness
in his posterity to imitate. For after that God had made choice
of a fixed place (Tabernacle, or Temple) 
to put his name there,
 such as
elsewhere sacrificed unto him were not onely guilty of Schisme (sepa∣rating
themselves from the publick worship) but flat Idolatry, serving
the true God in a false manner, namely, in a place prohibited. And
now it is seasonably remembred, that many ages after, 
Beersheba
 was an
eminent place of Idolatry. The
 Prophet threatneth finall confusion to
such that say, in nature of an oath, 
The manner of Beersheba liveth.

It being probable that as the
 brazen serpent set up by 
Moses,
 was af∣terwards
abused to Idolatry, so this grove of 
Abrahams
 planting near

Beersheba
 was by his posterity perverted to some solemn superstition,
the 
manner
 or 
way
 whereof, 
secundum usum Beershebae,
 was a precedent,
or leading pattern for other places to imitate: as 
Act.
 9. 2. & 18. 25. &
24. 14.



§ 14. But the City of 
Beersheba
 it self stood hard by on the brook

Bezor.
 The name imports, 
The well of an oath.
 First so called from
 
Abra∣hams,

then from
 
Isaac's
 ceremonious swearing and covenanting with

Abimelech
 in that place. Now if Scarlet keep colour because twice died,
and therefore called 
Dibaphon,
 well might 
Beersheba
 retain her
name, twice on the same occasion imposed upon it.
 Here God com∣forted

Iacob
 in his journey down into 
Egypt,
 promising him safety and
sight of his son 
Ioseph.
 Many hundred years after, 
Samuel
 at
 
Beersheba

set up his Sons for Judges, who degenerated from their Fathers in∣tegrity.
In the division of the land into two kingdomes, 
Beersheba

belonged to 
Iudah,
 where
 
Iehoshaphat
 set up Judges, and whither

 
Eliah
 persecuted by 
Iezebel
 fled for succour. Hence he fled into the
wilderness, leaving his servant at 
Beersheba.
 Not that he carelesly cast
him off, but as the case stood with 
Eliah,
 life was to be preferred be∣fore
attendance, and one alone might shift with more secrecy then two
together. Besides, by the avoidance of this servant (probably no person
of extraordinary performance) divine providence made a way for 
Elisha

(one of more desert) in this vacancy to be inducted into 
Eliah's
 service.


§ 15. Coming still west-ward on the bank of 
Bezor,
 we finde
the place where two hundred of 
Davids
 foot being faint stayed with
the
 baggage, whilest the rest of their brethren pursued and conquered
the 
Amalekites.
 But these at their return denyed the two hundred stay∣ing
by the brook, any part of their spoile, till 
David
 ordered it as

a leading case,
 that these which attended the baggage should be equall
sharers with such who fought in the battell. And very good reason:



1 It was not laziness, but weariness kept them behinde. A stout
heart sometimes cannot help a fainting body. Wherefore to
punish sickness in them for a sin, had been height of tyranny.


2 Grant their tired bodies could not keep pace with their souls, yet
no doubt in desire they marched along with their brethren, and
perchance by their prayers facilitated their victory.


3 During their staying behind, their imployment was as neces∣sary,
though not so honourable. The stuffe could not secure it
self, and the keeping of it in the others absence was a good piece
of defensive service.



Now from hence it appears, that in cases not provided for in the judi∣ciall
Law, the Princes of 
Israel
 were intrusted with power to enact
Statutes, in a prudentiall proportion to Gods word, binding all in
their dominions to the observation of them. This ordinance of 
David

may from the place be termed the 
Statute of Bezor.
 Nor is it any news
for Laws to be made in open fields by rivers sides, our 
English
 Laws
having had their birth in so plain a place in 
Ronny-mede
 near the river
of Thames, where King 
Iohn
 and his 
Barons
 first drew them up together.
Yea, no fitter place for such solmn acts then a rivers side, where the sight


thereof may be the remembrancer, 
that
 
Iudgement may run down as waters,
and righteousness as a mighty stream.
 Hence 
Bezor
 glideth into the Land of the

Philistines,
 whither in due time we will follow it.


§ 16. South of this brook lay the wilderness of 
Beersheba,
 often menti∣oned
in Scripture. Herein 
Hagar
 and
 
Ishmael
 wandred when the bottle
of water was spent, the last Legacy which 
Abraham
 bequeathed him. Oh
how she weeps, as if intending to refill the same from her eyes! but a∣lass, that moisture so brackish would rather increase then allay any thirst.
And now what should she do? It was death to her to see her son die, and
yet that pity which would not suffer her to tarry by him, would not per∣mit
her to depart from him. In this 
Dilemma
 of affection she resolves on
the distance of a bow-shoot,
 as a competent mean betwixt presence and
absence, and disposeth her self under one shrub, her son under another.
Here 
Ishmael
 cryes and God heareth. The very worst in extreme want are
the object of pity, and though 
Ishmael
 had mockes for 
Isaac,
 heaven had
mercy for 
Ishmael.
 An Angel sent shews 
Haga
 a fountain, not now new∣ly
created, but newly discovered to her sight. The object was there be∣fore,
but the Organ not rightly disposed to behold it. How near may
men be to their own happiness and miss it; touching it, yet not seeing it,
till God open their eyes! More south in this wilderness was the 
Iuniper-tree

under which
 
Elisha
 sate so highly discontented. Coales of Juniper
we know are extremely hot, but is there any secret quality in the shade
of that tree, to put 
Eliah,
 sitting under, into such passions, as that nothing
but death would please him for the present? Sorrow bought him asleep,
and afterwards awaking, being refreshed with a cake of bread, cruse of
water, and comfort of an Angel he undertook his journey to 
Horeb.


§ 17. Not far off betwixt 
Kadesh
 and 
Bered
 is 
Beer-laha-roi,
 that is, 
the
well of him that liveth and seeth:
 so
 named by 
Hagar,
 because there an An∣gel
catechised, comforted, and counselled her to return and humble her∣self to 
Sarah
 her mistress. By this well 
Isaac
 was walking and meditating,

when 
Rebekah
 brought from her Fathers house first met him, in her
most modest behaviour. For at the sight of him, though at some di∣stance,
she
 lighted from her Camel, counting it ill manners to ride, when
her husband and master went a foot: as also to give an earnest of her fu∣ture
good housewifery, that she would prefer industry before ease, honest
pain before pleasure. The she
 vailed her self, partly to shew that the beams
of her beauty were hereafter to be appropriated to 
Isaac
 alone, & partly in
confession of subjection, being now under covert-baron, the command
and protection of a husband. Well, I dare compare, yea prefer this vailed
wives chastity, before the virginity of many vailed votaries.


§ 18. More south is 
the river of Egypt
 the utmost limit, not onely of this
Tribe, but of all 
Israel.
 Indeed by 
the river of Egypt
 
 (often menti∣oned
in 
Exodus
) onely 
Nilus
 is intended. But this stream (which
some conceive is particularly called 
Shichos
) is termed the 
River of Egypt,



not because it is in, but is in the high way to 
Egypt.
 Otherwise, the travel∣ler
who sits down on the banks thereof, shall never come thither. In the

Septuagint, Rhinocolura
 is put for this river of 
Egypt,
 being a long named
city of short note, seated on the influxe thereof into the sea. Only this 
Rhi∣nocolura

is famous in heathen History, because hither (as into an Hospi∣tall)
all those malefactors were sent, whose noses were cut off for their
offences: a punishment inflicted on the 
Egyptians
 by an 
Ethiopian
 King
who conquered them Hence had it the name of
 
Rhinocolura,
 or the place
of 
nose-maimed
 people. But ô how great must that city be which in our
age should contain all those, whose faces are nose-less, not by others cru∣elty,
but their own luxury!


§ 19. As for other cities in this Tribe of 
Simeon
 they were many, but
obscure. It is observable that most of them are written with an 
Aliàs

first, as they are named 
Iosh.
 19. secondly, as they are called 
1 Chron. 2.

None need to wonder at their different denominations. Here I interpose
nothing of the severall writing of the same places



1 According to exact Criticks in spelling them.


2 According to vulgar tongues in pronouncing them.



Onely we commend to the Readers notice, that the book of 
Chronicles

was written after the return from
 Captivity; and about eighteen gene∣rations
after the days of 
Ioshua.
 And therefore some difference of letters
after so large a time is no strange thing. For seeing 
here we have no continu∣ing


city,
 it cannot be expected that any city should have a continuing
name. And yet great places longest retain their names unaltered, (as

London
 from 
Taeitus
 to our times) whereas small cities like these in 
Si∣meon

are as often alterable, as passed into the possession of severall ow∣ners.
Yea seeing it was the custome of the 
Iews, to
 
call their lands after
their own names,
 this haply might change
 
Beth-lebaoth
 in this Tribe, into

 
Beth-birei,
 when it came into the possession of a new landlord.


§ 20. So much of this small Tribe, whose portion was too little
for his people, and therefore they made two happy expeditions to en∣large
their quarters: one in the reign of
 
Hezekiah to the entrance of Gedor, e∣ven
unto the east side of the valley, a place of good and fat pasture; for they of Ham
(Canaanites) had dwelt there of old.
 Mice sometimes may be mens tasters, to
teach them which is best for their palate: and those heathen were wise
enough to settle themselves in the richest soile, whence now the 
Simeo∣nites

expelled them. This 
Gedor
 was in the division of the land allotted to
the Tribe of
 
Iudah.
 Now if any demand by what right the 
Simeonites

might invade this which was assigned to 
Iudah,
 they may know that in
case a strong hold could not be reduced into subjection by that Tribe to
which it belonged, it was not an act of injustice, but valour, for the next
Tribe to
 undertake the conquest thereof: As by their judiciall law if
one dyed not having issue by his wife, the next of kin might 
,
and was heire (as I may say) to marry his
 brothers wife; so when 
Iu∣dah



through some defect or debility was unable to improve his Patrimo∣ny
in 
Gedor
 to profit, by casting out the heathen who violently detained
it, 
Simeon
 (his next neighbour in situation) suecceding to the right of his
brother, attempted and effected the conquest thereof: Herein onely it
holds not proportion, because the seed so raised up was accounted to his
dead brother, whereas here 
Simeon
 made bold himself quietly to possess
what victoriously he had acquired. Wonder not that this petty Tribe in
overcoming 
Gedor
 did more then puissant 
Iudah
 could performe; for 
al∣ways
the battell is not to the
 
strong,
 and weaker means watching advantages
may perfect what more powerfull have left uneffected. This 
Gedor

(grudge not reader to sally with thine eye a little out of this Tribe, being
still in this map) lay on the north of the river 
Sorek,
 and was one
 of the
31. regall cities of the 
Canaanites.
 As for the 
Simeonites
 second voiage a∣gainst
the
 
Amalekites
 in mount 
Seir,
 more proper thereof hereafter in the
description of 
Edom.


§ 21. Now that which straightned the portion of 
Simeon,
 was the mul∣titude
of 
Philistines
 inhabiting the sea coasts, allotted to, but never posses∣sed
by this Tribe. 
Askelon
 was a prime city in those parts, once won by

 
Iudah
 assisting 
Simeon,
 but after recovered by the 
Philistines. Samson,
 be∣ing
cast to give his companions thirty change of raiment, went neither
to the Merchant for the 
stuffe,
 nor Taylor for 
making of them,
 but (know∣ing
the 
Philistines
 garments would best fit 
Philistines
 bodies) he marched
directly to
 
Askelon,
 where finding thirty 
Philistines,
 he bestowed their
corps on the earth, and their cases on their fellow-countrey men. This
caused that active antipathy betwixt 
Askelon
 and 
Israel, Tell it not in Gath,
nor publish it in
 
Askelon.
 Near to this city there was a
 lake, by which 
Se∣miramis

is said to be born, there fed and relieved by 
Doves.
 Hence the
Poet 
Tibullus.


Alba Palaestino sancta columba Syro.


The milke-white Dove esteem'd divine,


By Syrians of Palestine.

But because no mention of this in Scriptures, we forbear further prose∣cution
thereof.


§ 22. Going along south by the sea side (here styled the 
sea of the Phili∣stines
)
we come at last to 
Azzah,
 or 
Gaza
 the fifth satrapy of the 
Philistines,

once
 conquered by 
Iudah,
 but soon after returning to the former owners

Samson,
 who carried the gates thereof away, could not bring himself hi∣ther
again, without the guidance of another. Pain here was added to
his blindness, when set to grinde in a mill; scorn to his pain, when sent
for, at a solemn feast to be the musician to make sport, or rather the In∣strument
ready tuned for every wanton eye, tongue, and hand to play
upon. But such as mock at other mens miseries, sometimes laugh so long
till their own hearts ake. For 
Samson
 applied himself to the two pillars
most fundamentall to the roof of 
Dagons Temple,
 and by the strength of
his armes and
 prayers, pulling them down, killed and died together.


Strange that his enemies knowing his strength resided in his haire, pre∣vented
not the second growth thereof. But God first stupefies whom he
intends for destruction: 
Samson
 had lost his sight, the 
Philistines
 their fore∣sight
at the same time.


§ 23. Many ages after 
Gaza
 was smote by
 
Pharaoh
 King of 
Egypt,
 and
not warned thereby to repent, utter desolation was denounced against it.
There needeth no clearer comment on the Prophets prediction,
 
Gaza
shall be forsaken,
 then that passage in the Acts of the Apostles, 
the way unto
Gaza which is
 
wast.
 This vastation was caused by 
Alexander the great,
 when
he utterly razed the city, fulfilling what
 
Ieremy
 had foretold, 
Baldness is
come upon Gaza,
 whereby not onely the hair, but skin and flesh of this
proud place fell away, scarce any signes of a city remaining. Out of the
ruines hereof, some two miles westward (where 
Bezor
 falleth into the
sea) 
Majuma
 or 
Sea-Gaza
 once a proper port-town took its rise and in∣crease,
called afterward 
Constantia
 by 
Constantine the great,
 and 
Gatzra
 at
this day, where simple roofs supported with carved columns, and 
broken
pieces of Parian
 
Marble, serving for thresholds, jambes of doors, and sides of windows
almost to every beggerly cottage,
 testifie its former better condition. So much
for these 
Philistines,
 who are taxed for their soothsaying by
 
Isaiah,
 accu∣sed
of 
spightfulness and old hatred
 by
 
Ezekiel,
 challenged for cruelty by
 
Amos,

arraigned for pride by
 
Zachary,
 condemned by all to unavoidable de∣struction.
Think not that these 
Philistines,
 fox-like, fared the better for be∣ing
cursed, surely though slow, sure vengeance overtook them; and we
undoubtedly beleeve the same, although it be hard in history to shew
when, where, and how their particular extirpation was accomplished.


§ 24. 
Simeon
 hath usually assigned him for his armes, 
Gules,
 a sword

in pale,
 with the point thereof 
erected argent;
 alluding to 
Iacobs
 words, 
In∣struments
of cruelty are in his habitations,
 because of their perfidious massa∣cring
of the 
Shechemites.
 None of 
Solomons
 Purveyours in the Tribe of 
Si∣meon,

the reason whereof shall be rendered in our description of 
Iudah.
 If
any demand, why 
Simeon
 alone is omitted in 
Moses
 his solemn
 blessing
of the other Tribes, let them remember how 
Iacob
 coupled 
Simeon

and 
Levi
 in a curse; since which time the 
Levites
 had unstrained
their credit by their exemplary
 zeale against the Idolaters, but the

Simeonites
 had not recovered their reputation by any eminent act
by them atchieved. 
Moses
 therefore having no commission to recall 
Ia∣cobs

curse, and loth to repeat it, (lest the double-cursed 
Simeonites
 should
be utterly disheartned) thought it in pious policy best to pass them over
in silence. Of such persons, of whom we would willingly say no bad, and
cannot truly say any good, it is the wise
t way to say nothing. As for their
tradition that the 
Simeonites
 were imployed to be Scribes and Notaries to
the Tribe of 
Iudah,
 it is enough to mention it, knowing no sound autho∣rity,
whereon the same is grounded.






Here the Map of 
Benjamin
 is to be inserted.












THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIBE OF BENIAMIN. CHAP. 12.


§ 1. 
B
Enjamin
 youngest son of 
Iacob
 by 
Rachel,
 was by
his mother dying of him in child-birth named

Ben-oni,
 that is, 
the son of sorrow,
 but by his Father
called 
Benjamin,
 that is, 
the son
 
of the right hand.

Say not 
Iacob
 did ill in altering the 
Will
 of his
wife, and revoking the name, the last legacy she
bequeathed to her child, seeing the alteration was perfective, and for the
advantage of the 
Legatee;
 not to say that 
Rachels
 pangs imposed that
name, and might be presumed scarce 
compos mentis
 in what she did. But
the main reason of the alteration was, because 
Iacob
 could not call his
son, but must recall his lost wife to his mind, so that his very name con∣stantly
carried a coffin in the mention thereof. Highly he was beloved
of his Father; and good reason; First, because begot in his old age. Se∣condly,
because the youngest: and affection, which always descends,
when it can goe no lower, settles it self. Thirdly, because he was mother∣less.
Lastly, because brotherless, 
Ioseph
 being conceived dead, and so the
portion of affection due to him, fell to 
Benjamin
 as the right heir there∣of.



§ 2. Of this Tribe came out of 
Egypt
 thirty five thousand four hun∣dred,

all which dying in the wilderness, fourty
 five thousand and six
hundred of their children entred the land of 
Canaan.
 Afterwards an hea∣vy
dysaster befell this Tribe (of the cause and manner whereof hereafter)
insomuch that no.
 women and onely six hundred men were left of

Bemjamin.
 Yea none of 
Benjamin
 were left above ground, being destroy∣ed
from being visible on the face of the earth, and the six hundred re∣maining
all
 hid in the rock of 
Rimmon.
 Thus 
Benjamin
 was cut off from
the body of 
Israel,
 and onely hung dangling by one small sinew, which
by the carefull Chirurgery of their brethren, and Gods blessing upon it,
in short time recovered it self to be very considerable in 
Israel.


§ 3. Herein the words of the Psalmist deserve to be observed,
 
There
is little
 
Benjamin with their ruler. Little Benjamin:
 It was therefore no court-complement,
or modest excuse, but a downright truth. 
Saul
 said unto

Samuel,
 
Am I not a Benjami
 of the smallest of the Tribes of 
srael?
 It is added,

with their Ruler:
 no Tribe 
(Iudah
 excepted) more trading in Comman∣ders
then 
Benjamin
 did. Hereof were 
Saul
 and 
Ishbosheth
 both crowned
Kings, 
Ionathan
 the eldest son;
 
Mordecai
 the Favorite, 
Esther
 the wife of a
King;
 
Ehud
 the Judge, and 
Abner
 the Generall of 
Israel,
 with divers others.
And among Ecclesiasticall Rulers, let not him be forgot, 
who had the care
of all the
 
Churches,
 even
 Saint 
Paul
 the Apostle. But beside these Rulers,

Benjamin
 bred some enemies to authority, 
Ziba
 that false cheater, 
Shimei

that foul railer, 
Baanah
 and
 
Rechab
 privy traitours, 
Sheba
 a professed Re∣bell;
so impossible it is, all should be good herbs which grow in great
gardens.


§ 4. The lot of 
Benjamin
 came forth
 
betwixt the children of Iudah and
the children of Ioseph.
 If
 
a sparrow falls not on the ground,
 surely ground falls
not to any owner without Gods immediate providence. 
Benjamin

joined with 
Ioseph
 to day the possession of 
Rachels
 children entire together;
and joyned to 
Iudah,
 that vicinity of habitation might invite them to u∣nity
of Religion. And indeed commendable was the constancy of the

Benjamites
 both to God and their King, following the house of 
David
 at
the disloyall defection of the rest of the Tribes. Say not that little 
Benja∣min

was thus placed in the middle to be ground betwixt the mill stones
of two potent Tribes; for it matters not who lies on our sides, so be it
God dwells on our shoulders. Remember we the blessing 
Moses
 be∣queathed
to this Tribe,
 
The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him,
and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoul∣ders;

particularly pointing at his habitation in 
Ierusalem
 built in the
borders of 
Benjamin.


§ 5. Now though 
Benjamins
 mess,
 when he sate at 
Iosephs
 table, was

 five times as much as any of his brethren, yet here it happened his por∣tion
was less then all the rest: except any will say, that onely 
Benjamins
dish
 was less and 
meat
 more, because, though small the compass of


ground allotted to him, yet fair and fruitfull the soile, many and memo∣rable
the cities contained therein, 
,

The lot of this Tribe was straightned
 (saith
 
fosephus) because of
the virtue of the soile thereof.
 Yet as little as the land of 
Benjamin
 was, it was
big enough to be divided betwixt two kingdomes, the south-west part
thereof belonging to the kingdome of 
Iudah,
 the north-east to 
Israel,
 with
the cities of 
Gilgal, Iericho,
 and 
Bethel,
 as shall be made plain in the respe∣ctive
description of those places.


§ 6. 
Iordan
 is the eastern boundary of this Tribe
: 
David
 returning
victoriously from 
Mahanaim,
 having
 ferried over this water, partly
brought thither, partly met here, a miscellaneous multitude, 
Barzillai
 and

Shimei, Mephibosheth
 and 
Ziba,
 that is, loyalty and treachery, faith and
falshood mingled together in the same Countrey. Here (once railing)
now begging 
Shimei
 obtained pardon from him; because bringing a∣long
with him (the best argument in his excuse) 
a
 
thousand men
of Benjamin.
 Some will say, 
David
 shewed 
Shimei
 too much mercy, and
did 
Mephibosheth
 too litle justice, not righting him against the false ac∣cusations
of 
Ziba,
 who better deserved a whole halter, then half of
the lands of 
Mephibosheth.
 Such doe not seriously consider the present
condition of 
David;
 who, had his hand struck with the sword of
justice, before his feet (in his renewed kingdome) were firmely fast∣ned
on the throne of authority, it had been the ready way to have over∣turned
him and his posterity. Here
 
Sheba
 a 
Benjamite
 taking the advantage
of the unseasonable contest betwixt 
Iudah
 and 
Israel,
 which should have
most interest in 
David,
 with his trumpet blew rebellion into the eares and
hearts of the people; had not the dangerous consequence thereof been
seasonably prevented by the vigilancy and valour of 
David,
 and his
servants.


§ 7. More south on the banks of the river the children of the Pro∣phets
straightned for dwellings,
 went about to enlarge their habitati∣ons,
but meanly provided for that purpose, if we consider the



1 
Architect,
 a son of the Prophets, little skild (no doubt) in such
employment.


2 
Timber,
 green wood, and growing on the banks of 
Iordan.


3 
Tools;
 a borrowed hatchet, the iron whereof fell into the river.



Alass, how comes it to pass, that when houses of the Prophets are
to be built, the iron forsakes the handle, which sticks too stedfastly
thereunto, when they break them down
 
with axes and hammers!
 But

 
Elisha
 made all things whole, the 
hatchet
 came unto the 
helve
 swim∣ming
above the water.


§ The alter 
Ed
 succeeds next,
 more south-ward on the river. For∣merly
we have placed it in the Tribe of 
Reuben
 on the east of 
Iordan,

but others 
 it west of that river in this Tribe. Hear the arguments
for both.


For Benjamin.


1 It
 
was set up in the bor∣ders
of Iordan which are in
the land of Canaan,
 which
land strictly and properly
taken was on the west of

Iordan.


2 It was erected to shew
the contesseration of their re∣ligions.
And therefore most
probable and proper on the
west side of 
Iordan,
 in the
main continent of the land,
to claim right, or rather
continue a title of those sepa∣ratist-Tribes,

Reuben, Gad,

and 
Manasseh
 in point of
Gods worship with other
Tribes.


3
 Saint 
Hi
rome,
 and
since him learned
 
Tostatus

(to whose arguments in this
controversie we refer the rea∣der)
with many other Com∣mentators,
are very positive
in placing this Altar west of

Iordan
 in the Tribe of 
Benja∣min.


 For Reuben.


1 It was set up
 
over against the
land of Canaan.
 Which in proper
construction imports it to be on
the other side opposite thereunto.


2 It had been a meer trespass,
for the two Tribes and an halfe
in 
aliena Republica,
 to build an
altar on the ground of other
Tribes: and therefore no doubt,
they did it on their own ground
east of 
Iordan.


3 Iosephus
 
saith
 
.
Therefore the Tribe of Reuben and
Gad going over the river &c.


4 Another
 
Ioseph
 (though a
modern, yet a learned writer) be∣leeveth,
that in those elder times,
that Countrey or territory was
counted unhallowed, or unclean
which had not a place set apart
for Gods worship, and proveth
from the words of 
Phinebas,
 that
the altar was set up on their side,
lest otherwise having no place
consecrated, they might be con∣cluded
to live in an unhallowed
habitation.




Thus as this altar caused a difference betwixt brethren, about the
cause why it was erected: so hath occsioned a dissension amongst
learned men, concerning the place, where the same was set up. The
best is, the controversie is not of such moment, as to concern salvation.
Let us take heed, we be not of that 
Generation
 
which set not their hearts a∣right,

and then the danger is not great, though we set this altar on the
wrong side of the river. However, as the devout 
Iews
 in the primitive
times, when the Sabbath was newly changed into the Lords-day, kept
both Saturday and Sunday holy, observing both 
ex nimia cautela,
 to be
sure to keep the right day of Divine worship: so for more certainty we
have erected two altars, one one each side of the river, leaving it to the dis∣cretion
of the judicious Reader, to accept or refuse which of them he
pleaseth.


§ 9.
 Come we in the next place to the
 twelve great stones set up by

Ioshua
 in memoriall that there they passed over the river 
Iordan
 on


foot 
Tremellius
 conceives probably, that these were the 
quarries in Gilgal

mentioned 
Iudg.
 3. 19. whence 
Ehud
 returned back, when he went to
kill 
Eglon
 King of 
Moab.
 Others likewise conceive, that 
Iohn
 baptizing
hereabouts, did particularly point at these stones, in that his expression
to the 
Pharisees,
 
God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.

They were set up in the Countrey 
Gilgal,
 the city so called lying some
five miles west of the river.


§ 10. 
Gilgal (rolling
 in Hebrew) was so called by 
Ioshua,
 because the 
reproach
of Egypt was there rolled away from the Israelites,
 and circumcision suspended
during their travell, being
 here administred, and the Passeover solemnly
observed; here also 
Manna
 ceased, the Countrey affording plentifull
provisions. Miracles and meanes never shine together in the same
Horizon, but the former setteth, when the later ariseth. It will perchance
be demanded, why 
Manna
 rained so long, seeing the 
Israelites
 long a∣goe
were come into the plentifull Countrey of 
Canaan,
 all the while they
had remained in the land of 
Reuben,
 ever since they came over the river of

Arnon.
 It is answered, God hitherto continued his largess of 
Manna,




1 Because formerly they were only come into the skirts of the coun∣trey,
(unsufficient to maintain so numerous an Army) whereas
now they were entred into the very heart and middle of the land.


2 The land of 
Reuben
 though very fruitfull,
 
was a place for cattell,

fit for grazing, and better for beasts, then men to feed upon.


3 God to manifest his liberality, would not onely have his provi∣sions
to meet even, but to lap over, continuing 
Manna
 till his peo∣ple
were otherwise plentifully provided for, both with new
corn on the ground (coming hither in
 the beginning of harvest)
and
 old in their Granary.



Thus the 
Iews
 did not begin house-keeping on 
are walls,
 but were set up
with full stock afore-hand: victualled in a manner, with two years pro∣vision,
that with 
the good house-keeper
 
they might bring forth out of their trea∣sure
things new and old.


§ 11. In the days of 
Samuel
 and 
Saul,
 this was a place of principall
credit, where 
Saul
 was solemnly invested with a crown, 
Come, let us goe up
unto
 
Gilgal, and renew the kingdome there.
 Yet here at the same time to
shew Gods displeasure with the people for their tumultuous desiring
of a King,
 
Thunder in harvest (in Iudea Sommers thunder old mens wonder
)
exceedingly afrighted the hearers thereof. Afterwards 
Saul
 stained this
place with a double deed of disobedience,



1 When in 
Samuels
 absence he presumed to offer
 sacrifice. Once the
proverb was, 
Is Saul also amongst the Prophets?
 Now it may be, Is

Saul also amongst the Priests,
 invading the Sacerdotall function?


2 When contrary to Gods command, he spared and brought hi∣ther
the best of spoile of 
Amalek,
 so that 
Samuel
 was fain to sup∣ply
what justice was wanting in 
Saul, who hewed Agag in pieces before
the Lord in
 
Gilgal.





In after ages here was an Academy or Seminary of the sons of the Pro∣phets,

brought up here in learning preparatory to their profession. 
Ac∣quired,

are so far from hindering 
infused
 abilities, that the stock prepa∣red
by industry, is fittest to be graffed on by inspiration. 
Eliah
 and 
Elisha

were successively the 
Presidents,
 or rather the 
Visitors
 of this Colledge,
the latter being both food, and physick for the students therein:



1 Food, when with twenty small
 
Barly loaves
 he fed an hundred
of the children of the Prophets.


2 Physick, when his meal was
 Antidote against the malignity of
the wild gourd in their pottage.



It seems the sons of the Prophets were no expert Herbalists, whose
learning moved in an higher and holier sphere, and they more skilfull
to discern betwixt true doctrine and heresie, then betwixt pot-herbs and
poison.


§ 12. 
Gilgal
 was afterwards a sinke of Idolatry,
 and belonged to the
Kings of 
Israel,
 as appears by the Prophets counsell, 
though thou Israel play
the harlot, yet let not Iudah offend, and come yee not into
 
Gilgal &c.
 At 
Gilgal

men 
multiplied
 
transgression,
 whereupon destruction was denounced
against this place, and 
Gilgal
 was afterwards rolled up in her own
ruines. To return to the river 
Iordan,
 which a little south-ward falls in∣to
the
 
Salt-sea,
 the south boundary of this Tribe. The epithet Salt is
not here superfluous, but emphaticall, partly to distinguish it from the
sea of 
Cinneroth
 or 
Galilee,
 which was a fresh-water-sea; and partly be∣cause
the water hereof was salt with a witness, 
fire-salt,
 as I may say.
Let Philosophers demonstrate the cause of the brackishness of the Oce∣an,
though it is to be feared, they wil be posed nearer home, how rivolets
of teares which flow from their own eyes, come to be so salt. But a peculi∣ar
reason may be certainly assigned, why the water in this sea was tran∣scendently
salt above all others, whereof largely hereafter in the descripti∣on
of 
Iudah.


§ 13. Having done with the channell of 
Iordan,
 the certain and un∣moveable
bound of 
Benjamin
 on the east, come we now in our peram∣bulation
to surround the other three sides of this Tribe, and at first will
onely take notice of the limitary places, and so proceed from the rine to
the core, from the marches to the middle of this countrey. The south of

Benjamin
 ranged from 
Kiriath-jearim
 by 
the well
 
of the waters of Nephtoah,

to the valley of 
Hinnon,
 and so on the south of 
Ierusalem
 descended to 
En∣rogell.

All which places shall hereafter be presented in a peculiar map,
and therefore no more for the present.


§ 14. Hence it went forth to 
Enshemesh, i. e.
 the fountain of the Sun.
Either so called from the clearness of the waters thereof, or because in
Idolatrous days, when 
the hoste of heaven was
 
worshipped
 (whereof the Sun
the Generall) it was dedicated thereunto, or because the suns extraordina∣ry
influence thereon endued it with soveraign virtue. And now it is well


remembred, that 
Bath
 in 
England
 is called by
 
Antoninus Aque solis
 or the
waters of the Sun. Hence the bounds of 
Benjamin
 stretched to 
Geliloth

near
 
Gilgal
 (over against the going up to 
Adummim
) and thence descen∣ded
to the stone of 
Bohan
 the son
 of 
Reuben,
 so called no doubt from
some memorable act by him there atcheived, for otherwise the 
Reube∣nites

had no part of possession on the west side of 
Iordan.
 Hence this
Tribe extended through 
Arabah
 to 
Beth-hoglah, i. e.
 as
 Saint 
Hierome
 in∣terprets
it, 
Locus gyri,
 or the place of a circle, because (as he will have it)
in this place 
Ioseph
 with his brethren set in a round (the forme of
mourners) bewailed the corps of 
Iacob
 brought hither out of 
Egypt.


§ 15. But leaving this as a conjecture,
 most sure it is, that herea∣bouts
was the 
floor of Atad,
 where so solemn a lamentation was made
for 
Iacobs
 death, that the place long after did weare mourning in the
name thereof, therefore called
 
Abel-mizraim, i. e.
 the 
sorrowing of the Egy∣ptians.

Strange, that strangers, being
 the Elders of 
Pharaohs
 Court and
kingdome, should so affectionately bemoan the death of a man no whit
related unto them. Surely the 
Egyptians
 did not 
weep-Irish
 with faigned
and mercenary teares, much less was their passion onely State-sympathy
and politick compliance, sighing and smiling with the sighs and smi∣lings
of 
Ioseph.
 Rather it was because the endearing disposition, and
obliging goodness of old 
Iacob,
 living fifteen years with them in 
Egypt,

had gained the generall love of the land. Besides, they lamented his
loss as the death of their own grand-father, because he was Father to

Ioseph,
 the Father, founder and preserver of them and theirs in the time
of famin. If any demand why the 
Egyptians
 mourned for 
Iacob
 three∣score
and ten days, whilst 
Ioseph
 made a mourning for him but for

seven days? I can tell the common answer, that the former ignorant of
heavenly happiness lamented him totally lost, whilst 
Ioseph
 not
 
mourn∣ing
without hope
 was more moderate in his lamentation. But whether
this solution be sound in it self, or the question exactly conformable to
the text, we remit it to the examination of others. I would rather know
the reason why this solemnity of sorrow, was performed in this place,
rather then at the cave of 
Machpelah
 forty miles hence, where the corps
were interred; surely the 
Master of the Ceremonies
 in those days could give
an account thereof.


§ 16. But here it will be objected, that 
Ioseph
 coming out of 
Egypt,

had a nearer way by many miles to carry 
Iacobs
 corps to 
Hebron,
 then
by going over 
Iordan.
 It is confessed, but this fetching a compass was
conceived more for the state of the funerall. Unfitting it was, that the
body of that worthy Patriarch (to whom all the land belonged by
promise) should steale into that Countrey in a clandestine way, and
privately enter in at the postern door, rather let it solemnly surround the
Countrey, and be brought in at the broad gates. Thus the corps of
men of quality, though the Chancell-door be nearer, are borne


through the porch and middle-alley to the place of their interment.


§ 17. So much for the south-marches of 
Benjamin,
 we come now
to visite the north-limits thereof. Those began from 
Iordan
 (saith our
English translation.) 
In divertigio Iardenis quo magis adhuc ad orientem divertit

(saith 
Tremellius
 in his note on the place) 
i. e. in the winding of Iordan as it
turns still more to the east;
 and we could wish, that this eastern flexure of that
river, had been made a little more visible in our Maps. Hence they
went up to the 
side
 
of Iericho,
 understand thereby the confluence of the
waters afterwards running to 
Iericho
 (as appears by paralleling 
Iosh.
 16. 1.
with 
Iosh.
 18. 12.) and so through the mountains westward,
 
the goings
out thereof are at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
 Whence it turneth towards 
Luz

which is 
Bethel,
 south-ward, which now I come to describe.


§ 18. 
Beth-el,
 that is, 
Gods house,
 was so named by 
Iacob
 (for formerly
it was called 
Luz
) who here lying on a stone (it matters not how hard
our bed, if so heavenly our dreams) saw a
 
Ladder
 with God on the
top thereof, and Angels 
ascending and descending thereon.
 Going down to
attend on Gods children according to their commission, and up to
give an account of their attendance, and receive farther instructions.
Here 
Iacob
 by vow indented with God solemnly to make this place his
house, and to give to him at his safe return
 with bread and water, the
tenth of all his substance. But though God over performed his 
counter∣part

herein, 
Iacob
 neglected his promise, and when his staffe was swelled
into
 
two bands,
 set down his staffe at 
Shechem,
 and turned there a purcha∣ser
of a parcell of ground, till God minded him of his former obligati∣on,

Arise
, 
goe up to Bethel, and dwell there &c.


§ 19. Most happy that man 
who runs the way of Gods commandements,
 and
next him he is the best, 
who answers the spur,
 and with 
Iacob
 goeth, when
almost driven. Hither he comes (having first reformed his family of

Idolatry) and here built an Altar called 
El-beth-el.
 During his abode
here died 
Deborah Rebekahs
 nurse, venerable for her old age, having seen
her nurse-childs childrens children, to the fourth generation. Surely
she was well loved whilest living, because so much lamented when
dead, buried under
 
Allon Bachuth,
 or 
the oake of mourning.
 As if 
Iacobs

children desired, that their eyes should return that moisture to her in
teares, which her breasts had bestowed in milke on their grand∣mother.
Thus, though the Hebrews did not so doate on their nurses,
as the wild-Irish (who love them better then their own
 mothers) yet
they had them in an high estimation.


§ 20. In the division of the land,
 
Beth-el
 fell to the lot of
 
Benjamin.

Yet we finde that the 
house of Ioseph
 (understand the Tribe of 
Ephraim
)
wan
 and possessed it. It seems the City was divided into two parts, the
northern pertaining to 
Ephraim,
 the southern to 
Benjamin.
 In the days of

Samuel
 we finde, how
 
he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and
Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all these places;
 which were all three


in this Tribe, and in the heart of the Countrey, conveniently seated for
Termers to resort hither from all parts thereof.


§ 21. Here 
Ieroboam
 set up one of his golden calves: and how busie
was he about sacrificing unto it,
 when a Prophet sent from God de∣nounced
the destruction of his Altar, which presently clave asunder,
according to his prediction? An Altar, which (were it of brass or
stone) was softer then the miracle-proof heart of 
Ieroboam,
 which nei∣ther
was broken, nor bruised thereat; as also he was no whit moved to
repent, with the drying up, and
 restoring of his hand, which happened
thereupon. Indeed he conceived, that his kingdome must have Idolatry
for the pillars, which had Rebellion for the foundation thereof: and
though 
Baalisme
 began and ended with the family of 
Ahab, Calfe-worship

was rivetted into the Crown of 
Israel.
 As for the Prophet that foretold
the future ruine of this place, a Lion
 slew him in his return, because he
credited a pretended 
Revelation Parole
 unto another man, before a Com∣mission
from God to the contrary, solemnly signed and delivered un∣to
himself. See Gods finger in the Lions paw, how rationally did the
brute-beast work his Masters will, being sent not to prey, but to punish?
He killed the Prophet, filled not himself, but with the
 Asse; stood by
the corps, if not as mourners for, as waiters about it. Behold his life
spilled, whilest wicked
 
Balaams
 was spared in journey, so uncertain it
is for any to conclude Gods 
love
 
or hatred
 from outward events.


§ 22. 
Eliah
 and 
Elisha
 often visited this City of 
Beth-el;
 the latter go∣ing
up hither was mockt by the children thereof, for lacking the comely
excrement of haire on his head, whereupon came 
two beares out of the wood,
and tare two and forty of them.
 Some will say, 
Elisha
 had better have called
for two rods, then 
two Beares
 out of the wood, therewith to 
drive out that
folly which was bound up in the heart of these children.
 But his severity will
appeare needfull herein, if all circumstances be considered,



1 Probably (though termed children) they were striplings of some
bigness, who durst adventure out of the city by the wood-side.


2 No doubt the chickens crowed as the cocks had learned them,
and followed the precedents of their Idolatrous parents.


3 The gemination of their offence, 
Goe
 
up thou bald-head, goe up
thou bald-head.


4 They mocked him 
as he was going up the way,
 and it is said, the
Prophet 
turned back,
 so they continued their taunts whilest he
came to them, yea till he was at them, yea when he was past
them.


5 
He looked on them,
 so that had any ingenuity or remorse been legi∣ble
in their countenances, no doubt he would have suspended
his sentence.


6 
He cursed in the name of the Lord,
 not out of spight, but with Gods
Spirit, and the judgement followed accordingly.





Probably some of them escaped to the City, and there might instruct
their mothers and nurses, never more to fright children with 
fond tales
of Bug-bears,
 but seriously to informe them of the truth of this sorrow∣full
accident.


§ 23. In this City 
Beth-el
 there was also a nursery of the 
Sons
 of the
Prophets.
 Alas, what heart had they to live here! Could the 
Stall
 of the
golden calfe be a convenient place for them to study in? The frequent
and abominable impieties here committed, they could neither behold
with silence, nor reprove with safety. However, it seems, they were
especially desirous of, and delighted in this place, where God had imme∣diately
manifested his gracious presence to 
Iacob:
 and we may charitably
beleeve, by the privateness of their lives secured themselves both from
pollution and persecution. But for the main, 
Beth-el
 was changed into

Beth-aven, Scala coeli
 into 
Gradus inferni,
 the Devills then dancing for joy,
where once Angels (those holy Agitators) went up and down betwixt
heaven and earth. Yea in after-ages it was penal for any pious Prophet to
approach this place, such the strictness of the prohibition herein,
 
Pro∣phecy
no more at Beth-el, for it is the Kings Chappell, and it is the Kings Court.
 As
if it were against the 
Law of the Verge
 for one to 
draw a sword
 (though of
Gods word) within the bounds and precincts of the Palace of the ido∣latrous
Kings of 
Israel.


§ 24. The last memorable mention that we finde of 
Beth-el,
 was
when 
Iosiah
 burnt the bones of the idolatrous people on the
 Altar there.
Some will say, he shewed little wisdome, and less valour therein, to en∣counter
dead corps. Yea the living found more offence by the stinking,
then the dead felt pain by the burning of these bones. Nor was the altera∣tion
thereby produced of so great moment, seeing otherwise it would
have been 
dust to dust,
 and now was 
ashes to ashes.
 But we must know
that 
Iosiah
 herein was not acted with principles of cruelty, but moved in
obedience to Gods command, to fulfill that prophecy some hundred
years before foretold
 of him. Whilest here they were ransacking the se∣pulchers,
behold one solemn grave (the house of the dead) with a stone
thereupon, (the door of that house) with an Epitaph on that stone, (the
Porter of that door) wherein, on enquiry appeared, that Prophet lay
interred, who long since forespake these passages now come to pass. His
corps were
 spared by special command, and with him quietly rested
the old Prophet▪ so good is it, (as we have
 elsewhere observed) to
keep good company both in life, and after death. So much of 
Beth-el,

whence the border of 
Benjamin
 descended from Ataroth-Adar near the hill
which lyeth on the south side of the nether Bethoron.


§ 25. In assigning the west border of this Tribe,
 we meet with
a churlish difficulty in the text, drawing the bounds thereof so, as to

 
compass the corner of the sea southward.
 Here the Quere ariseth, how any
part of 
Benjamin
 could approach the sea, the Tribe of 
Dan
 being inter∣posed


betwixt it and the 
Mediterranean. Rabbi Solomon
 seeking to salve
it, by 
Sea
 understands some great water in the west of this Tribe: and
what he affirmeth, is proportionable enough to the Hebrew language,
terming all watry confluences a 
Sea,
 as we have formerly
 observed.
And indeed what is our English word 
Mere
 used in the samesense more or
less then 
Mare,
 or a Sea? I should be inclined to the opinion, that the
 
pool of
Gibeon
 so eminent in Scripture, and styled by 
Ieremiah, the
 great waters which
are in Gibeon,
 should be the 
Sea
 herein intended. Or if the words of the
Text calling it 
the sea,
 without any other addition, must be understood
of the best and biggest in that kinde, (and then can be no other then
the Mediterranean sea) then I shall embrace the judgement of learned

 
Macius,
 interpreting 
 
jam,
 not the 
Sea,
 but the 
west
 onely; which
the propriety of the tongue will well endure.


§ 26. From this 
western compass
 (aliàs 
Sea
 in other translations) the
limits of 
Benjamin
 range to 
Kiriath-jearim,
 in the confines of this Tribe,
where the Arke was Leiger for twenty years, and whence 
David
 in a
new cart intended to convey it to 
Ierusalem.
 This kinde of carriage was
but
 
Philistine
 divinity, and a Pagan precedent; not so ordered by 
Moses

in the mount. When the Arke was removed from 
Shilo,
 it was
 set on
the 
Levites
 shoulders; and I see no reason, why they now should be too
good to beare it. 
Uzzah
 and 
Ahio
 drive the cart. The former with his
hand held it from shaking, such his store of good intention, and sha∣ked
it with his holding, such his want of due qualification. God stri∣keth
him
 with death, and 
David
 is startled thereat. Is this the Arke
placed so near the Mercy-seat? Oh how terrible then is the throne of di∣vine
Justice! For a time therefore the Arke is set to sojourne in the
house of 
Obed-Edom,
 where the Land-lord was blessed for go good a
guest. Diuine ordinances, according as their subject receiveth them,
are either cordials or poysons, and the Arke brought 
ither a curse or a
blessing, whithersoever it came.


§ 27. The place where the former dysast
r happened was called by

David Perez-Uzzah,
 nigh
 
Nachons
 threshing-floor. We meet with ma∣ny
such places in the Bible, distant from Cities, where husbandmen
housed, and beat out their grain, with severall inventions: namely,



1 With the feet of
 Oxen treading out the corn.


2 By the
 wheel running over them. 
Make them O Lord like &c.


3 With flailes, which having wooden handles, had their ends

 armed with iron.



But amongst all their devices, the lazy 
rick of the
 wild Irish, never
entred into their braines, who to save pains, burn the straw, so to part
the grain from it.


§ 28. So much for the borders of 
Benjamin.
 Come we now into the
middle thereof, and first we finde the waters of 
Iericho
 arising in the
confines of 
Ephraim.
 The naughtiness of this water was m
raculously


healed by 
Elisha
 putting salt into the
 fountain thereof. I say miraculous∣ly,
otherwise that ingredient would rather have made it more brackish,
then less bitter.
 Hence those waters run south-ward to the City of 
Ie∣richo;

whose name (as 
Munster
 interprets) signifies 
having a good savour.

Indeed so delicious the situation thereof (after the cure aforesaid
wrought by 
Elisha
) that, had Profit and Pleasure been disposed to solace
themselves together, no fitter place could be found for that purpose.
Fragrant the flowers, sweet the herbs hereabout; especially the garden
of Balsame, which in the days of the 
Romans,
 occasioned a quarrell
betwixt them and the 
Iews,
 who manfully defended it. Happy
had the latter been, if as zealous for the substance, as for the shadow,
losing their own lives to maintain the type, and taking away his life,
who was the truth thereof. Then balsame intended by nature for the
curing, was the causing of many wounds, such deadly blows passed be∣twixt
them.


§ 29. 
Ioshua
 took this City with the sound of Rams horns,
 whereat
the wall fell down to the ground. It troubleth me not to conceive, how
the rest of the wall falling flat, 
Rahabs house
 built thereon should stand
upright: seeing divine power, which miraculously gave the Rule, might
accordingly make the Exception. A solemn
 curse was by 
Ioshua
 impo∣sed
on those who should rebuild the walls of 
Iericho,
 so to obliterate the
monument of divine power and justice.


§ 30. But 
Iericho
 thus dismantled, maintained the reputation of a
City,
 and though not walled with stone for defence, was shaded with
trees for pleasure. It is called the
 
City of Palmes
 (where
 
Ehud
 killed

Eglon
 the corpulent King of 
Moab
) growing so plentifully round about it.
These Palmes, or Date-trees had scaly barks, and the boughs were ge∣nerally
used, in all combates of manhood, to crown the conquerour.
For, as
 
Erasmus
 observeth, though severall countries, on sundry occasi∣ons,
had distinct garlands of victory, made of Laurell, Olive, Myrtle,
Oake &c. yet the Palme-tree carried away the palme from them all, and
was universally entertained as the Embleme of triumph. The worst I
wish these trees is, that they may never want store of weight, seeing
Naturalists observe, the more they are depressed, the more they flou∣rish.


§ 31. But to return to 
Iericho;
 it is ill hollowing in the eares of a
sleeping Lion, and worse awaking that dust, which God would have
dormant in eternall obscurity. See this in the walls of 
Iericho,
 which

Hiel
 the 
Bethelite
 affronting heaven built again: and according to

Ioshua's
 execration,
 
laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his first borne, and set
up the gates thereof in Segub his youngest son;
 that is, both the one and the
other were then destroied by untimely deaths. Strange that seeing his
first son drop away, he desisted not from that design; but such the pre∣cipice
of bad projects, once step in, and seldome stop in the way of


wickedness. Nor can 
Hiels
 presumption herein be excused, whatsoever
is pretended in his behalf, being led to this act of contempt, by one of
these considerations:



1 H
 mistook 
Ioshua's
 curse rather for a patheticall expression, then
propheticall prediction.


2 He conceived the virtue thereof worn out and antiquated, after
five hundred years continuance.


3 He chose rather to bottome his memory on so famous a stru∣cture,
then to build it on his posterity, as sooner likely to decay.



However 
Hiel
 got a curse, and 
Iericho
 walls thereby, which afterwards
grew to be a potent, and populous City.


§ 32. When the twelve Tribes were divided into two kingdomes,


Iericho
 probably pertained to 
Israel,
 as may app
ar,



1 By the frequent conversing of 
Eliah
 and 
Elisha
 in this City, suffi∣ciently
known to have been subjects of the crown of 
Israel.


2 Because 
Hiel
 the 
Bethelite (Beth-el
 belonging to 
Israel
) built the
walls thereof.


3 Because that building bears date in 
the
 days of Ahab,
 and is not
accounted according to the reign of 
Iehoshaphat,
 the contempo∣rary
King of 
Iudah.



Afterwards it was in the possession of the Kings of 
Iudah,
 because in the
reign of 
Ahaz,
 the captives of 
Iudah
 are said to be 
brought back to Iericho
unto their
 brethren.
 When carried into 
Babylon,
 no more then three
 hun∣dred
fourty five of this City returned home, whose zeale
 was very for∣ward
in repairing the walls of 
Ierusalem.


§ 33. Here Christ cured blind 
Bartimeus;
 and 
Zacheus
 the Publican (one
of more state then stature) dwelt in this City.
 Long had he wished
for a sight of Christ: and curiosity in this kinde may sometimes open the
door for devotion to enter in. But alass, he was so low, more likely in
the crowd to loss himself, then finde his Saviour, till on a suddain he
grows a proper man, by getting up into a
 
Sycamore
 tree. Who dares
say 
Sycamores
 are always barren? See one here loaden with good fruit.
Christ seeing him invites himself to his house, and down he comes
(with more speed no doubt then he gat up) to welcome his guest with
good cheer, though the 
last-course
 he brought in, was the best; protest∣ing
a fourfold restitution of what he had wrongfully gotten, and giving
the half of his remaining estate unto the poor.


§ 34. 
Iericho
 was surrounded with plains on every side.
 Hither
King
 
Zedekiah
 fled, and here was taken by the forces of 
Babylon.
 The
high-way betwixt 
Iericho
 and 
Ierusalem
 is infamous for theeving, be∣cause
of the covert the neighbouring wilderness affords; and great roads
are the best rivers for robbers to fish in. Wonder not, that so short a
way betwixt two such eminent Cities, was no better secured, seeing
some hundred years since, little safer was the road betwixt 
London
 and


Saint 
Albans:
 till an Abbot of that place, cut down the woods, that
afforded them shelter. Reader, if thy occasion should call thee to goe
from 
Iericho
 to 
Ierusalem,
 I wish thee well guarded; but if it be thy hard
hap, with the man in the Gospell (be it history or parable) to be rob∣bed
and wounded with theeves, mayst thou meet with some good

 
Samaritan,
 to convey thee to the Inne, and provide necessaries
for thee.


§ 35. West of the waters of 
Iericho
 stood 
Ai,
 a small City, but great
enough to give a check to the full speed of 
Israels
 victories. Their losse
here was inconsiderable
 in it self (no more then thirty six men) but
dangerous in the consequence thereof. Such a flaw in their orient suc∣cess,
made them cheap in the worlds valuation; and the 
Canaanites

(who hitherto had charactred them invincible in their apprehension)
began hence to collect, and conclude a possibility of conquering them.
Yet not valour too little, in such as fought, but sin too much in some
who staid at home, caused this defeat. 
Achan
 was the man, who in fine
proved no whit richer for the gold, or warmer for the garment he had
stolen. Detected by lot, accused by his conscience, convicted by his
own confession, condemned by 
Ioshua
 he (with his
 children and cattle)
is stoned by the 
Israelites.
 The place of his execution was called, the 
vale
of Achor, or the vale of trouble,
 both because 
Achan
 actively had troubled

Israel
 with his sin, and because here he was justly troubled by them in
his punishment. As for the promise of the Prophet in after ages, that the

 
vale of Achor should be a door of hope,
 understand it mystically, that the
most deplorable, and seemingly desperate estate of the Church, is capa∣ble
of comfort, and may in Gods due time be changed into a prospe∣rous
condition. 
Achan
 thus punished, how active are the Armes of the

Israelites,
 when freed from the fetters of Sacriledge! 
Ai
 is quickly conque∣red,
the inhabitants thereof being trained by a dissembled flight of their
foes, into their own destruction. Now although such ambushes are
now adays unambushed, by the generall suspicion all have of them, yet
in the infancy of the world, when battells were meerly managed by
main might, and downright blowes▪ (men bringing all their forces a∣bove
board) such 
lying in wait
 was an unusuall stratagem, and perchance
may justly be referred to 
Ioshua,
 as the first inventor thereof.


§ 36. West of 
Ai,
 betwixt 
Bethel
 and 
Ai,
 was the
 mountain, where

Abraham
 and 
Lot
 long lived lovingly together, until the contest betwixt
their
 heardsmen, when the land was grown too little for their sub∣stance.
Poverty preserveth amity, when riches oft-times make rents a∣mong
friends. Hard by was the City and wilderness of 
Beth-aven,

which signifies 
the house of vanity.
 Strange, that any should impose on a
place (except in derision) so ill, and unlucky a name. Yet, hath not

Solomon
 in effect set the same on the whole world?
 
Vanity of vanities, all
is vanity.
 But 
Beth-aven
 seems emphatically so called, for some eminent


Idolatry committed therein. Neer this place
 was the wood, wherein
when it rained honey from heaven, the 
Israelites
 being in pursuit of the

Philistines,
 wanted hands to receive it, having them bound up by 
Sauls

adjuration, not to eat before night. I see neither piety, nor policy, but
humour and headiness in 
Sauls
 resolution, the way to encrease their

stomach,
 and not their 
valour.
 Might not a cursory meal been allowed
them, in a running march, a snatch and away? Here 
Ionathans
 eyes were
opened with tasting a little honey, and presently his eyes were opened
again in a sadder sense, seeing himself liable to death for breaking his
Fathers command. Nor was it his own innocence, and 
invincible ig∣norance

of the law, but the peoples
 interposing, which preserved him
alive. Yet will not this one good act of popular violence, make amends
for those many mischiefs, which their impetuous exorbitances in other
cases have produced.


§ 37. Still westward of 
Beth-aven
 stood 
Gibeon,
 termed a
 
royall City

in Scripture, that is, a fair and princely place; otherwise, in all the tran∣sactions,
betwixt this City and the 
Israelites,
 we meet with no King
thereof, which may almost perswade us to believe it a popular State.
The inhabitants thereof with clouted old shooes, mouldy bread, and
a lie farther fetched then their journey, (pretending their dwellings at
great distance) deceived the congregation of 
Israel,
 then camped at 
Gilgal.

For the smoke of those ovens, wherein their bread was baked, might
almost be perceived from 
Gibeon
 to 
Gilgal,
 which space 
Ioshua
 marched
over with his foot-army in one
 night. However, hereby they saved
their lives, onely for their cheat were condemned to be 
Nethinims
 or 
Deo∣dands,

that is, people given to God, to hew wood, draw water, and doe
the drudgery of the Tab
rnacle and
 Temple, a condition which they
gladly accepted of; so sweet is life in it self, though sawced with servi∣tude.


§ 38. Afterwards 
Ioshua
 with a miraculous victory here conquered the
five Kings of 
Canaan,
 which assembled themselves to besiege 
Gibeon,
 in re∣venge
of their defection to the 
Israelites.
 Never had battell more of God
therein; for, he himself brought up, or rather let down the 
train of Artillery,

killing the 
Canaanites
 with hail-stones from heaven, as they
 
fled in the go∣ing
down to Bethoron unto Azekah.
 Here 
Ioshua
 by his faithfull prayer stopt a

Giant
 in his full career, as he was running his race, staying the Sun in


Gibeon,
 to attend his execution on his enemies. This was (as I may say)
the 
Barnady day
 of the whole world, the very longest, which that climate
ever did, or shal behold, when 
time
 was delivered of 
twins,
 two days join∣ed
together without any night interposed. How the heavens (this ex∣traordinary
accident notwithstanding) were afterwards reconciled to
their regular motions, and how the expence of so much delay, was re∣paired
by future thrift, (I mean this staying of the Sun made up in the
years account, by his swifter moving afterwards) I leave to be audited,


and cast up even by Astronomers. Mean time, the foresaid five Kings,
were first hid, then stopt in the cave of
 
Makk
dah,
 till 
Ioshua
 commanded
them to be brought forth, and his souldiers to set their feet on
their necks; and 
David
 in his expression many years after, reflecteth
hereon, 
Thou
 
hast given me the necks of mine enemies &c.
 Then were those
five Kings hanged by 
Makkedah
 a regall City of the 
Canaanites,
 which at
that time was taken, and the
 King thereof destroyed by 
Ioshua.


§ 39. To return to 
Gibeon▪
 it was afterwards one of the four Cities in
this Tribe, which were allotted to the
 
Levites,
 and yet we finde it the
Theater chiefly of martial atchievements; for, by the great pool in 
Gibeon,

in 
Helkath-hazzurim,
 or, 
th
 field of strong men,
 was 
Abner
 with the host of

Israel
 worsted by 
Ioab
 Generall for 
David;
 when 
Asahel
 like a 
wild Roe

(wild for his rashness, Roe for his swiftness) would not be perswaded
from pursuing of 
Abner, untill nigh the hill Amnah which
 
lieth before Giah,

he taught 
Asahel
 the great difference between a nimble leg, a and vigorous
arme, smiting him with his spear under the fifth rib.


§ 40. Under the same rib,
 at 
the great stone
 
which is in Gibeon, Ioab
 jea∣lous
of 
Amasa
 his cousin-german (Ambition owns no alliance, and is
onely of kin to it self) bas
ly murdered him in this manner. 
Ioab
 had a
sword hanging on his loines, and 
as he went it used to
 fall out,
 as if it
sought for another sheath, b
sides what it had already. Surely he had
put his sword in this careless posture, thus to play at 
in and out,
 to cover
his intended murder, under some pretence of casualty, as if in his em∣braces
his weapon had hurt 
Amasa
 by unhappy accident. Vain excuse,
for certainly his sword could not of its own accord have gone so quick∣ly,
and so deeply to 
Amasa's
 fifth rib, had not 
Ioab's
 steddy aime, both
dispatched it on that errand, and directed it to that place. 
Amasa
 thus
slain, all the people passing by 
make an halt
 at his corps, and 
every
 
one
that came by him stood still,
 untill his body was removed. Where amongst
so many gazing on his corps, it is hard, if the active thoughts of some
did not light on this observation of divine justice, that he now was trea∣cherously
slain, who
 so lately had been the Generall to a Traitor.


§ 41. In the beginning of the reign of King
 
Solomon, Gibeon
 was a
publick place of divine worship, where part of the Tabernacle resided.
Here two things are carefully to be observed:



1 The Arke it self. This being taken out of the Tabernacle at 
Shi∣loh,

by
 
Hophni
 and 
Phinehas,
 never returned thither again. But
from the land of the 
Philistines
 was brought back, first to
 
Beth∣shemesh,

thence to
 
Kiriath-jearim,
 thence to the house of
 
Obed-Edom,

and at last fixed and setled by 
David
 in 
Zion
 under the co∣ver
of a Tent
 which he had pitched for that purpose.


2 
The Tabernacle of the Congregation,
 made by 
Moses
 in the wilderness,
wherein the Priests attended about their publick sacrifices. This
about 
Solomons
 time was translated from 
Shiloh
 to 
Gibeon
 as a


place of more eminency, and conveniency for divine service, be∣cause
a City of the 
Levites.



Herein 
on the high place in Gibeon, Solomon
 offered to God a thousand burnt
offerings, and (which was most acceptable) a zealous prayer reque∣sting
wisdome of God, who bestowed both it, and wealth, and
honour upon him. Thus those who chiefly desire grace, receive it, the
jewell, and at least a competency of outward provisions, for a cabinet
to keep it in. Some hundred years after, by 
the great waters which are in Gi∣beon,
Iohanan
 the son of 
Karcah,
 recovered the remnant of the poor 
Isra∣elites

(left in the land after the captivity of 
Babylon
) from 
Ismael
 a Prince
of the bloud royall, who had a design to carry them away captive unto
the 
Ammonites.


§ 42. Next 
Gibeon,
 we take the City of 
Gibeah
 into our serious consi∣deration,
not as nearest in situation, but in sound of like name, inso∣much
that some have unwarily confounded them, as the same place. 
Gi∣beah

lay in the south-west part of this Tribe, whose inhabitants were
bad men, but good
 markes-men, right shooters (
at an haires breadth
and faile not
) but unrighteous livers. A 
Levite
 coming with his concu∣bine,
and servant from 
Bethlehem,
 declined to lie at
 
Ierusalem,
 because
then an heathen City, and (though late) recovered this 
Gibeah
 for his
lodging place. Alas, what was this, but 
from the fire into the furnace?
 so
excessive hot was the lust of the people of this City. But charity therein
was as cold, none inviting this 
Levite
 to his house, untill an old man
(and he also no inhabitant, but a stranger of mount 
Ephraim) coming
from his work
 
out of the field at even,
 (Industry is the fewel of hospitality)
kindely entertained him in his house. In fine, the 
Levites
 concubine
was by violence, and variety of lust of the men of this City abused to
death. Oh the justice of divine proceedings! She had formerly been
 false
to her husband.

Culpa libido fuit, poena libido fuit.


By lust she sinned, and 'twas just


She should be punished by lust.

This villany being declared to all 
Israel,
 a consultation thereon, and first
in a fair way the offenders are demanded to justice, which denied and
all the Tribe of 
Benjamin
 engaging themselves to defend the damnable
deed of those of 
Gibeah,
 all 
Israel
 resolves in a nationall war, to revenge so
foul a murder.


§ 43. Here let us stand still and wonder,
 that an army united a∣mongst
thems
lves 
as one man,
 most in number, best in cause, wisest in
counsell (as who had asked, and obtained the advice of God himself,
to goe on in this war) should once, and
 again be defeated, by those
who were weaker, and wickeder then themselves. I cannot challenge
the army of 
Israel,
 for any eminent sin at this time, yet it is very suspici∣ous,
they were carnally confident of the conquest, as accounting the
victory 
eleven to one
 on their side. However the next battel made amends
for all, wherein all the raveno
s wolves of 
Benjamin,
 with their dams


and whelps at home, were utterly destroyed, except six
 hundred, and
those cooped up in a grate, and hid in the rock of 
Rimmon.
 Thus, what
once was sadly said of 
Ioseph,
 was now more true of 
Benjamin,
 
One is not.

And the whole Tribe had finally been extinguished, had not provision
been made to supply them with wives, as formerly hath been
 observed.


§ 44. Afterwards this 
Gibeah
 got the surname of
 
Saul,
 because he
was born, lived, and buried here. In this 
Gibeah
 of 
Saul,
 five of his
sons (amongst whom a 
Mephibosheth,
 but not the 
Mephibosheth
) were in

Davids
 reign hanged up on the hill before the Lord, to expiate 
Sauls

murdering of the 
Gibeonites.
 How strangely was his zeale transposed,
turning the back of his sword towards the
 
Amalekites,
 whom God
commanded him to destroy, and using the edge thereof against the 
Gi∣beonites,

whom by oath he was bound to preserve? Here 
Rizpah Sauls

concubine, covered the corps of such as were executed, with sackcloth,
to keep birds and beasts, from feeding upon them.


§ 45. Her kindness to the dead is
 told to King 
David,
 who not one∣ly
gave the hearing, but the practising of so good an example, and there∣by
is put in minde, to shew mercy to the bones of 
Saul,
 and 
Ionathan,

which he fetched from 
Iabesh-Gilead,
 and buried hard by in 
Zelah,
 in the
sepulcher of 
Kish
 his Father. Shewing thereby, that his former severity
to 
Sauls
 sons, proceeded from a publick desire of his subjects good, no
private design of revenge upon 
Saul,
 whose corps he so solemnly inter∣red.
Corpses, which were but wanderers, whilest hung up by the 
Phi∣listines

in their City of
 
Bethshan;
 were but sojourners, when buried by
the 
Gileadites
 in the land of 
Gad;
 but now became house-keepers, when
brought home to the proper place of the sepulcher of their Fathers.


§ 46. Hard by 
Gibeah
 was 
Migron,
 a small City, where 
Saul
 for some
time abode with his men under a
 Pomegranate-tree. Say not, that
such a tree was a simple palace for a Prince, for in those hot Countreys,
pleasant was the residence for some short time, under the shadow there∣of.
Yea, our Countrey-man
 
Bede
 can tell you, how in our cold cli∣mate

Anno Domini 601. Augustine
 the Monke held a Synode under an
Oake (called 
Augustines Ake
 in old English) which tree our learned

 Antiquary placeth in the confines of 
Worcester-shire.
 Nor far from 
Mi∣gron
is Ramah
 a City, built by 
Baasha
 (jealous that 
Israel
 would revolt to

Iudah,
 on 
Asa's
 reformation of Religion) to stop all intercourse betwixt
the two kingdomes. Not that the armes of so small a City, could reach
seventy miles from the sea to 
Iordan,
 but because 
Ramah
 was greater in
command, then compass, as advantageously seated on some roade, or
pass of importance. But 
Baasha
 diverted by the invasion of 
Benhadad

King of 
Assyria,
 desisted from his building; for which he had made so
large preparation, that 
Asa
 afterwards repaired the neighbouring ci∣ties
of 
Geba
 and
 
Mizpah,
 with the stones provided for the fortifying of

Ramah.



§ 47. 
Mizpah
 now mentioned lay some eight miles hence, full north.

When in the days of 
Samuel,
 the seat of justice was annuall for the time,
and tripartite for the place, 
Mizpah
 had a fair share thereof,
 
Samuel went
from year to year, in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpah,
 lying in a kinde
of triangle, 
and judged Israel in all those places, and his return was to Ramah, for
there was his house.
 State-affairs made not the good man to forget his fa∣mily,
spending three Terms abroad on the publick, and the Vacation at
home, on his private occasions. At 
Mizpah
 was a generall reformation
of the people, when conscious of their sins, and sensible of Gods anger,
they 
drew
 
water,
 that is, plentifully powred forth tears before the Lord.
Say not, that their weeping was a 
labour in vain,
 and such 
drawing of water

(like the bottomless buckets of the 
Belides
 never to be filled) ineffectuall
for the expiation of sin, because no sorrow for the same is sufficient, see∣ing,
not the intrinsecall worth of their tears, but Gods gracious appreti∣ation
of the sincerity thereof, gave the value to their weeping. After∣wards
at
 
Mizpah, Saul
 out of modesty, or policy, was hid among the
stuffe; when found there, fetched thence, and presented to the people for
their king, appearing so proper a person, that nature might seem to de∣sign
him for supremacy, and mark him out to be the
 
Overseer
 of 
Israel,

who was higher then any of the people, 
from the shoulders, and
 upwards.


§ 48. In the days of King 
Baasa, Asa
 King of 
Iudah
 frighted with fear, made
a
 pit in 
Mizpah
 for his retreating place. No doubt though the entrance,
and orifice thereof, did promise no more then a plain pit, yet it was

contrived into rooms, and fortified with substructions therein, fit for the
receipt of a Prince. Wonder not, that he would prefer to trust his person
here, rather then within the walls of his royall City 
Ierusalem;
 for surely
this was not provided for a place of long residence, but for present priva∣cy,
and sudden safety, if extremity required it. After the 
Babylonish
 capti∣vity,
when 
Gedaliah
 was made governour of those poor 
Iews,
 which were
left to till the land, he made
 
Mizpah
 the seat of his short government.
Thus have I often seen fishermen, when they have caught store of fish,
cast the young fry (worth neither the keeping, nor killing) into the river
again, to be breeders, in which consideration the King of 
Babylon
 preser∣ved
these poor 
Iews
 from destruction. Slight not 
Gedaliahs
 place, as dis∣gracefull
to be 
Prince of beggers,
 for they were in a thriving way, and pro∣bable
to improve themselves to a considerable condition, had not 
Ismael

(an unhappy name to persecute Gods children) a Prince of the bloud, kil∣led
him, with his followers, casting them into the midst
 of the pit that 
Asa

made, now employed to bury the dead, but first intended to preserve the
living. In the days of the 
Maccabees,
 whilest 
Ierusalem
 was possessed, and
profaned by the heathens, they repaired to
 
Mizpah,
 as a place formerly
fortunate for that purpose, to fast, pray, and beg Gods blessing on
their undertakings against their enemies.


§ 49. South of 
Mizpah
 lay the place called 
Eben-ezer,
 that is, 
the stone of


help,
 so named, by way of Prolepsis in Scripture, 1 
Sam.
 4. 1. for otherwise
for the present, this place was no help, but an hindrance to the 
Israelites,

who here were twice beaten in battell by the 
Philistines.
 At the second
time they brought their 
Reserve,
 I mean the
 Ark, into the field, & carnal∣ly
conceited, that victory would fly along with them, on the wings of
the Cherubims over the Mercy
seat. But the sanctity of the Ark did not
so much invite, as the profaneness of the managers (
Hophni
 and 
Phinehas
)
did repell Gods gracious presence, from going along therewith; inso∣much
as the Ark it self was taken captive, and carried into 
the land of the
Philistines.
 Some years after the 
Philistines
 again charge the 
Israelites
 in the
same place, presuming on their former victories, that in so fortunate a
place they might prescribe for conquest, but God turned the tide of their
success. At the importunate suit of 
Samuel
 (whose prayers were more
potent, then formerly the presence of the Ark, to obtain victory) the

Philistines
 were routed, and smitten untill they came under
 
Bethcar.

Whereupon 
Samuel
 set up a stone, between 
Mizpah
 and 
Shen,
 and called
it 
Eben-ezer, the stone of help,
 to perpetuate so memorable a conquest.


§ 50. Hard by is 
Beeroth,
 once a City of the
 
Gibeonites
 (with 
Chephirah

not far off) afterwards the
 birth-place of 
Baanah
 and 
Rechab,
 the mur∣derers
of 
Ishbosheth. Gittaim,
 whither those of 
Beeroth
 fled for fear of the

Philistines
 (saith 
Tremellius
 when 
Saul
 was slain) and west thereof 
Bozer

and
 
Seneh
 two famous rocks; which 
Ionathan,
 and his armour-bearer
clambred up upon their hands and
 feet. They found it more hard to
come at, then to conquer their enemies, & yet whē on the top of the rock,
they were but at the bottome, and beginning of their work. They lay a∣bout
them, and kill many in a little space: so that they climbed not up
the hill so slowly, but their enemies more swiftly ran down the same. Yet
such as will justifie 
Ionathans
 act herein, for pious and prudent, must re∣trait
to 
Divine inspiration,
 and plead, that his undertaking, as his success, was
extraordinary; otherwise, his tempting of God, had been higher then the
rock he climbed up, to adventure himself on such visible disadvantages.


§ 51. 
Anathoth
 remains, lying hence south-east; a city of the 
Levites,
 yea
of the Priests, yea of the High-priests, as a country-house, or retiring place
for them out of the populous city of 
Ierusalem. Abiathar
 being deprived of
the priest-hood, for practising with 
Ioab,
 without the privity of 
David,
 to
promote 
Adonijah
 to the Crown, was sent hither by 
Solomon,
 and confined
to live
 privately on his own lands. Hence plainly appears the power of
the Kings of 
Israel
 over the Priests; which on their misdemeanour in civill
matters were subject to secular punishment. But 
Ieremy
 the Prophet was the
honour of 
Anathoth,
 that man of mourning, famous for his book 
De Tristi∣bus,

or most poeticall 
Lamentations,
 (though therein not bemoaning his
own, but the publick calamities) born
 in this city. As here he drew his
first; so he was likely to have drawn his last breath, by the
 conspiracy of
the people against him, had not God frustrated their wicked designe.


Herein the observation of our Saviour was verified,
 
A Prophet is not with∣out
honour, save in his own countrey, and his own house.
 Afterwards, 
Ieremy
 at 
A∣nathoth,

bought the ground of his uncl
 
Hanameel,
 with all the formalities
of bargain and sale, most
 sol
mnly passed betwixt them. Is a Prophet a∣mongst
the purchasers? commonly they are as clear from money, as the
Apostles
 were: but this was r
ally, yet mystically done, to fore
ell the
future felicity of 
Israel,
 after the captivity of 
Babylon,
 that men should have
setled estates, with good title to, and t
nure of their land therein.


§ 52. 
Michmash
 is still behinde, which we name last,
 because not entire∣ly
in this Tribe, but in the confines of 
Benjamin
 and 
Ephraim.
 It lay
 cast
from 
Beth-aven,
 often mentioned in Scripture as the Rendesvouz, some∣times
of the 
Israelites
 in the reign of 
Saul,
 and sometimes of the 
Philistines.

The latter marched hence three severall ways, on design to extirpate all

the smiths in Israel▪
 Mark their motions,



1 One party went 
the
 way that leadeth to Ophrah, to the land of Shual,

that is, north-east.


2 Another 
turned the way to Bethoron,
 that is, full west.


3 The third 
to the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim,
 that is,
south-east.



Thus dividing themselves they compass their ends, and destroyed that
necessary profession in all the land. For the musick of the harp may bet∣ter
be spared in a common-wealth, then the noise of an hammer. Indeed,
I have heard, that ther
 is an house on 
London-bridge,
 built entirely of
wood, without any mixture of iron-nailes therein, therefore commonly
called 
None-such,
 for the rarity of the structure thereof: but if any could
shew a civilized State extant on earth, without the use of smiths therein,
it deserveth the name of 
N
ne
such
 indeed. Yea, the very 
Philistines
 them∣selves,
(though they suppressed the military use of smiths, for matter of
Armes) permitted by way of lone their use to sharpen instruments of

husbandry. This not their bounty, but policy suffered, as being confi∣dent,
when the 
Israelites
 had ploughed, harrowed, & sown their ground,
reaped, housed, and threshed their grain, then they at pleasure could
come up, to take bake, and eate it themselves.


§ 53. So much for the cities in 
Benjamin,
 of whose situation we have a∣ny
certainty. A second sort succeeds, known by their conjecturall flags to
be of doubtfull position. Amongst these 
Nob
 justly claimeth the prece∣dency
(made by us within the compass of 
Anathoth
) a city of the Priests,
where 
Ahimelech
 victualled 
David,
 and his men, with
 
shew-bread,
 and
armed him with the sword of
 
Goliah,
 there kept for a monument. Let
others enquire, why 
Davids
 sling was not rather preserved for that pur∣pose,
seeing it overcame the other. A false brother was present, by name,

Doeg;
 nation, an 
Edomite;
 office, 
master of the Kings heardsmen;
 who told al, and
more then all to 
Saul,
 adding of his own head, that 
Ahimelech
 
enquired
counsell
 of the Lord for him. Sure I am, 
Doeg
 enquired not of the Lord,


when he told so damnable an untruth. Hereupon, 
Saul
 condemned the
Priest to death, and others declining so savage a service, 
Doeg
 undertook
it, killing 
fourscore and five persons, which wore a linen Ephod,
 besides women,
children, sucklings, and cattel: so voracious was the appetite of his sword,
and so active his cruelty, when 
in commission,
 and armed with authority.


§ 54. The Readers eye may easily discover such places of uncertain
position, as remain;
 and amongst them 
Zemaraim,
 so named in Hebrew,
for plenty of wooll thereabouts, as 
Woollwich
 in 
Kent,
 and 
Woollton
 in 
Dor∣set-shire

are so called, upon the same occasion. We set 
Zemaraim
 next 
Bethel

because named
 next unto it, where some place the
 
Zemarites
 ancient
inhabitants of 
Canaan,
 as we have formerly
 observed. Nigh this city was
an hil
 of the same name, whereon King 
Abijah
 stood, & made his excellent
oration (wanting nothing but a better man to utter it) immediately before
his miraculous victory, over the Army of 
Ieroboam.
 The 
Valley of Craftsmen,

which though it sounds like a Countrey, yet, because going in
 equipage
with other cities, may be concluded a city it self. And what are 
Valladolit,

or 
Vallis Olitana
 in 
Spaine,
 and 
Vale-royall
 in 
Cheshire,
 but the former a fair
city & the latter (lately an Abby) now a village? I am almost of opinion, that
this 
Valley of craftsmen,
 took its denomination from 
Solomons
 work-men,
of whom we
 read, that 
in the plain of Iordan in the clay ground,
 they cast all
the brasen vessels of the Temple, did not the position of that place,
(whereof before) lie a little more north-ward. We conclude with 
Zeboim,

not the same with that city, first
 burnt, then drowned in the Daed-sea, but
another probably built not far thence, near the influx of 
Iordan
 into the
dead-sea.


§ 55.
 
S
imei
 the son of 
Elah
 was 
Solomons
 Purveyor in 
Benjamin:
 The
Armes of 
Benjamin
 were 
Gules,
 a 
Wolfe salient argent,
 in allusion to 
Iacobs

words, 
He shall
 ravin as a Wolfe, in the morning he shall devoure the prey, and at
night he shall divide the spoil.
 Surely the conformity hereof was not found
in the person of 
Benjamin,
 who appears rather lamb-like, then wolvish, in
that little left of him in Scripture. Some conceive, they have found the re∣semblance
in the two 
Sauls
 of this Tribe, the one persecuting 
David,
 the
other the Son of 
David
 (Christ in his members) with raging cruelty. But
to wave the various Rabbinicall conceits hereof, certainly, this (as al other
similitudes of this nature) is not to be sought, in the disgraceful, but com∣mendable
qualities of a Wolf. Thus, when God saith of himself,
 
Behold I
come as a thief,
 it is not meant, injuriously, fraudulently, mischievously; but
secretly, suddenly, irresistibly. This premised, though wolves and foxes
generally hear ill in Scripture, yet the former excell in sight, descrying
things at great distance; in sleight, of excessive agility of body; & in might,
very strong, in proportion to the bulk thereof. All which properties dis∣cover
themselves in the 
Benjamites,
 quick sighted, steady
 handed (witness
their good mark-men) and stout-hearted; in a word 
, so that
both their valour and success are foretold, in this blessing bestowed upon
them.

THE TRIBE OF IVDAH. CHAP. 13.


§ 1.
I
UDAH,
 fo
rth son of 
Iacob
 by 
Leab
 his wife,
was generally a well-natured man,
 ende∣vouring
preservation of his brother 
Ioseph,

and an excelle
t speaker, being the
 mouth
for the rest of his brethren, in his eloquent
oration to 
Ios
h.
 Not that these his good
qualities (which otherwhiles were allayed
with lust
 and cruelty) were the causes, bu
 rather the effects of Gods
preferring him above the rest of his brethren. Of this Tribe, threescore

and fourteen thousand and six hundred canne out of 
Egypt;
 all which
deservedly dying in the wilderness for their disobedience, the next ge∣neration
descended from them, being threescore and sixteen thousand
and five hundred, possessed the land of 
Canaan.


§ 2. 
Iudah
 (saith the
 Scripture) 
prevailed above his brethren,
 
and of him
came the chiefe rulers,
 so that he may be traced all along by the footsteps of
his soveraignty. Whilest they were in th
 wilderness, God ordered, that
the standard of 
Iudah
 should pitch first o
 the
 east side of the Taberna∣cle

towards the rising of the Sun.
 Perchance, to denote that the
 
Sun of righte∣ousness
arising with healing in his wings,
 should be extracted from that Tribe.
When 
Ioshua
 was dead, and the childre
 of 
Israel
 asked of the Lord,

Who shall goe up first for us to fight against the Candanites?
 It was answered,


Iudah shall goe up. Othniel
 the first Judge was hence descended, and

David,
 in whose royall line the Crown lasted for above four hundred
years: and after the return from captivi
y, 
Zorobabel
 of the Tribe of 
Iu∣dah

is honoured with the style of
 
Governour,
 which office for some time
continued in his family. In a word (besides Princes) so puissant was
the Tribe in Generalls, 
Ioab, Abishdi, Amasa &c.
 Statesmen, 
Caleb, Ahitophel;

and Prophets, 
Nat
an, Amos, Micah;
 that in dignity, as in strength and


number it surmounted all the rest. Yea, 
Napthali's
 fearfull Hinde durst
not 
bellow;
 nor 
Issachars
 patient. Ass 
bray;
 nor 
Ephraims
 strong Oxe 
low;

nor 
Benjamins
 cruell Wolfe 
howle;
 nor 
Dans
 cunning Serpent 
hiss,
 if

Iudah's
 Princely Lion was pleased to 
roare,
 as Commander of all the
beasts of the field and forest.


§ 3. However,
 I dare not (with some) interpret 
Iacobs
 solemn pro∣phecy,

the Scepter
 
shall not depart from Iudah, nor the Law-giver from between
his feet, untill Shiloh come,
 of a constant Soveraignty immoveably fixed in
this Tribe till the birth of our Saviour: a Tenet unteinable with truth,
seeing of the many Judges in 
Israel,
 but two of this Tribe; 
Saul,
 the
first King, of 
Benjamin,
 and the 
Maccabees
 of the Tribe of 
Levi,
 who after
the captivity attained to Kingly honour amongst the 
Iews.
 Rather we
understand 
Iacobs
 words of the whole nation, (whom he in the Spirit
foresaw, should in process of time be called 
Iews,
 as the land 
Iudea,
 from

Iudah
) and expound them to be a prediction, that the 
Iews
 should never
totally, and finally lose the visible being of a kingdome, or common∣wealth,
with a form of government amongst themselves, (though of∣ten
changed and altered in the manner, obscured and eclipsed in the
lustre, confined and emparied in the power thereof) untill 
Messiah
 should
be manifested in the flesh. Which came to pass accordingly, when the

Iews
 at our Saviours birth (and more completely at, and after his death)
had lost all shadows of a free State, totally inslaved to the 
Romane
 Em∣perour.
To whom alone b
longed,



1 The 
Militia
 with the Castle, giving martial-law to the Temple
it self.


2 Coine, stamped with the image and superscription of
 
Cesar.


3 Customes, collected, yea extorted by his Publicanes.


4 Power in causes capitall, by the Priests own confession,
 
It is
not lawfull for us to put any man to death.



And the prophecy of 
Iacob
 thus expounded, is both clear in it self, and
according to the interpretatio
 of the
 Ancients.


§ 4. This Tribe had 
Dan
 and 
Simeon
 on the west,
 
Benjamin
 on the
north, the 
wilderness of Paran
 o
 the south, and the 
Dead-sea
 on the
east. Extending east and west, welnigh fourty miles; but from

Cadesh-Barnea
 to 
Ierusalem
 was about sixty six. Where in this countrey was
conteined a mountainous land, but fruitfull with all commodities for
pleasure and profit. We begin with the Dead-sea, 
Iudah's
 eastern boun∣dary,
and so shall proceed to 
rround it in our description.


§ 5. This was
 once a fruit
ull countrey,
 called the 
vale of Siddim, even


as the garden of the Lord,
 Paradi se it self. Too like indeed thereto, both
for the pleasure thereof, and Se
pent therein, the spreading wickedness
of the vicious 
Sodomites. Lot
 chose to live here, not because the people
were well nurtured, but the place well 
vatered; though better watered
(no doubt) during his living there, with his teares, from a soul
 
vexed


with their filthy conversation.
 He lost by his dwelling among them, for
whose sins he was carried
 captive by 
Chedorlaomer; They
 gained by their
dwelling so near him, for whose sake they were rescued by his uncle 
Abra∣ham.

Yea, afterwards 
Abraham
 endevoured to save the whole city of 
Sodome,

beating down the price of Gods justice as low, as possibly it might consist
with his honour, to
 
ten righteous men:
 and yet that too high a rate for the pie∣ty
of 
Sodome
 to reach, so general was the wickedness therein. Hereupon, 
So∣dome,

with three neighbouring Cities,
 
Gomorrah, Admah,
 and 
Zeboim,
 was
destroyed with fire and brimstone from heaven, and thereby the whole
Countrey turned into a standing stinking lake.


§ 6. Some will say,
 it was strange, that fire should beget water, a
combustion produce an inundation. More proper it had been, that such
an inflammation should have left and 
Aetna, Hecla
 or 
Vesuvius
 behinde it,
fuming, if not burning always. The rather, because next morning
this place presented it self to the eyes of 
Abraham, as the smoke of a
 
furnace.

But such must know, that when the fire was once out:



1 The Countrey by nature was low and levell, being a depressed
plain, and so more subject to drowning.


2 
Iordan
 (running through this vale, and there sinking into the
ground) had a quality in the first moneth to
 overflow his
banks, and so prone to occasion a deluge.


3 Probably, the river was formerly bridled with artificiall banks,
which either were then broken down with that tempest, or af∣terwards
decayed by degrees, when the people were destroyed.


4 
Iordan,
 in the vacancy of the inhabitants, having got violent
possession, fenced and fortified himself in the 
slime-pits,
 (as in
so many castles) whereof great
 plenty in that place, and could
not afterwards be ejected.



Thus his title to this plain, though at first an unjust usurpation and
incroachment, is made lawfull by the prescription of three thousand
years possession.


§ 7. This sea is known by severall names. 1. The 
Dead-sea,
 either
because the Charnel-house of so many dead carcasses then destroyed there∣in;
or, because it kills all creatures coming into it; or lastly, because
dull and dead, not enlivened with a tide, or quickned with any visible
motion, one main cause of the offensive savour thereof, laziness disposing
men to lewdness, and waters to putrefaction. 2. The
 
Salt-sea
 salt in∣deed,
from the sulphurous combustions first occasioning it. 3. By
Greek writers it is termed the 
Asphaltite-lake
 from 
, or 
Bitu∣men,

growing plentifully thereabouts. This 
Bitumen
 (we are fain to re∣tain
the Latine word, our land neither affording the thing, nor our
language the name to signifie it) is a clammy, glutinous substance, use∣full
in Physick to astringe, in Surgery to consolidate. Used by the rich as
morter to build, (as in the tower of
 
Babel
) by the poor as oile to burn,


therfore called 
 in hebrew; quickly kindled, hardly quenched, flaming
far and long, as partaking much of pitch, and more of brimstone in the
nature thereof. And such as could not goe to the cost of richer spices, used
it for imbalming their dead, being a great drier, and so preserver from
corruption.


§ 8. This 
Salt-sea
 was sullen and churlish,
 differing from all other in
the conditions thereof. 
David
 speaking of other seas, saith, 
there goe the
ships,
 
and there is that Leviathan which thou hast made to play therein:
 so in∣stancing
in the double use of the sea, for ships to saile, and fishes to
swim in. But this is serviceable for neither of these intents, no vessels
sailing thereon, the clammy water being a reall 
Remora
 to obstruct their
passage; and the most sportfull fishes dare not jest with the edged-tools
of this Dead-sea; which if unwillingly hurried thereinto by the force of
the stream of 
Iordan,
 they presently expire. Yea, it would kill that 
Apocry∣pha-Dragon,

which 
Daniel
 is said to have choaked with lumps of
 pitch,
fat, and hair, if he should be so adventurous to drink of the waters there∣of;
so stifling and suffocating is the nature of it. In a word, this sea
hath but one good quality, namely, that it entertains intercourse with no
other seas; which may be imputed to the providence of nature, debar∣ring
it from communion with the Ocean, lest otherwise it should in∣fect
other waters with its malignity. Nor doeth any healthfull thing
grow thereon, save onely this wholesome counsell, which may
be collected from this pestiferous lake, for men to beware how they
provoke divine justice, by their lustfull and unnaturall enormities.


§ 9. Heathen writers,
 
Tacitus
 and 
Pliny,
 take notice of this lake, with
the qualities thereof, but especially 
Solinus,
 whose testimony (but with
some variations from Scripture) we thought fit to insert, and translate,
though the latter will scarcely be done, without some abatement of the
native elegancy, and expressiveness thereof. 
Longo
 
ab Hierosolymis re∣cessu
tristis sinus panditur, quem de coelo tactum testatur humus nigra, & in cinerem
soluta. Duo ibi oppida, Sodomum nominatum alterum, alterum Gomorrhum. Apud
quae pomum gignitur, quod habeat speciem licèt maturitatis, mandi tamen non potest.
Nam fuliginem intrinsecus favillaceam ambitio tantùm extimae cutis cohibet: quae
vel levi tactu pressa fumum exhalat, & fatiscit in vagum pulverem. A good way
side of Ierusalem lies ope a melancholy Bay, which the black soil being also turned in∣to
ashes▪ witnesseth to have been blasted from heaven. In it are two towns, the one called
Sodome, the other Gomorrah. Wherein grows an apple, which though it seem fair and
ripe, yet cannot be eaten. For, the compass of the outward rinde onely, holds within it
an ember-like soot: which being but lightly pressed, evaporates into smoke and be∣comes
flittering dust.


§ 10. But 
Lot
 was preserved,
 and God is said therein 
to have
 
remem∣bred
Abraham,
 though he might have seemed to have forgotten him, in
refusing to grant to spare 
Sodome
 at his request. Thus, though divine
providence may denie good mens prayers in the full latitude of their


desires, he always grants them such a competent proportion thereof,
as is most for his glory, and their good. 
Lot
 with his wife are en∣joined
onely not to look back, wherein she disobeyed the commande∣ment,
either out of



1 High contempt: Yet seeing for the main she had been a good
woman, accompanying her husband many miles from his
native to a strange Countrey, meerly depending on Gods
providence, our charity believes her fact proceeding rather
from


2 Carelesness, or incogitancy, having for that instant forgotten the
command; or


3 Curiosity, to behold the manner of so strange, and suddain a de∣struction;
or


4 Infidelity, not conceiving it possible, so great a City could be so
soon overthrown; or


5 Covetousness, when she thought on the wealth she had left
behinde her; or


6 Compassion, hearing the whining of swine, braying of Asses,
bleating of sheep, lowing of kine, crying of children, shriek∣ing
of women, roaring of men, and some of them of her own
flesh and bloud.



Were they any, or all of these, back she looked, and was turned in∣to
a
 pillar of salt, which, Saint 
Hierome
 saith, was extant in his age-Mean
time, how sad a case was 
Lot
 in, bearing about him life and
death? one halfe of him quick, lively, and active; the other halfe,
(his wife, both making but one flesh) so strangely, and suddainly,
sensless, dead, and immoveable.


§ 11. Not far off is the City of 
Zoar (Littleton
 in English) so named
by 
Lot,
 whereas formerly it was called 
Belah.
 I say by 
Lot,
 who was
the best benefactor to this place, which otherwise had been sent the
same way of destruction, with the other four Cities, had not his
importunity
 prevailed with God, for the sparing thereof. Yet I
finde not any monument of gratitude made by the men of 
Zoar,
 to
the memory of 
Lot
 their preserver; yea, they would not afford him a
quiet and comfortable being amongst them, insomuch that 
he
 
feared
to dwell in Zoar.
 Either suspecting that they would offer violence to his
person, or infect his soul with their bad example, or that he might be
involved in their suddain destruction, as a wicked place spared, not
pardoned by God, and allowed to himself for his present refuge,
not constant habitation. Their ill usage of so good a man, mindes
me of 
Solomons
 observation,
 
There was a little City and few men within it,
and there came a great King against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks
against it. Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and 
e by his
wisedome delivered the City, yet no man remembred the same poor man.
 No more


then 
Lot
 was remembred in 
Zoar,
 though the 
tutelar Saint
 thereof. But
his clear conscience, in free doing this courtesie, rewarded it self in do∣ing
it; whilest mercenary souls, working onely for the wages of thanks,
often lose their labour, especially in this ungratefull age.


§ 12. From 
Zoar,
 
Lot
 removed to a neighbouring
 mountain, and
dwelt in a cave therein, which is shown to travellers at this day. Now,
an hole in an hil could hold him, and all his family, whose substance for∣merly
was so great, the whole Countrey could not afford room for his
flocks and heard-men, without
 striving with those of his uncle 
Abra∣ham.

Here made drunken by his daughters practise upon him▪ with them
he committed incest. It is grace, not the place, can secure mens souls
from sin, seeing 
Lot
 fasting from lust in wanton and populous 
Sodome,


urfeited thereof in a solitary cave; and whilest he carefully fenced the
castle of chastity, even to make it impregnable against the battery of
forein force, he never suspected to be surprised by the treachery of his
own family.


§ 13. So much for 
Pentepolis,
 once a countrey of five cities, now all
turned into one lake. Come we now to survey the particular limits of
this Tribe. That Maxime, 
Qui bene distinguit, bene docet,
 holds most true
herein: the well distinguishing of bounds, conduceth much to the true
knowledge of this Countrey; especially, seeing the 
Holy Spirit
 hath been
so exact in assigning them. Where God is pleased to 
point,
 for man not
to vouchsafe a 
look,
 sheweth, that proud 
earth
 valueth his 
eyes,
 as more
worth then the 
hand of heaven.


§ 14. The borders of 
Iudah
 with all their particular flexure are thus

described in
 
Ioshua.






East.


South.


North.


West.






The Salt-Sea.




1 From the south-side of
the salt-sea, to the go∣ing
up of Acrabbin.


2 Thence to the wilder∣ness
of Zin.


3 Thence to the south-side
unto Kadesh-Barnea.


4 Thence to Hezron.


5 Thence it went up to
Adar.


6 Thence fetched a com∣pass
to Karkaa.


7 Thence it passed to
Azmon.


8 Thence unto the river
of Egypt.


9 Thence went out at the
Sea.


Observe we, that these
south bounds of 
Iu∣dah,

are for the main
the same with the
south limits of the
whole land, assigned

Numbers
 34.






1 From the end of Iordan at
the salt-sea to Beth-hoglah


2 Thence by the north of
Beth-araba.


3 Thence it went up to the stone
of Bohan the son of Reuben.


4 Thence towards Debir
from the valley of Achor.


5 So northwards looking to
Gilgal, before the going up
to Adummin, on the south
side of the river.


6 Thence towards the wa∣ter
of Enshemesh.


7 Thence to Enrogel. Thence
by the vally of Benhinnom
unto the south of Ierusalē.


8 Thence to the top of the
mountain at the end of the
vally of Rephaim.


9 Thence to the fountain of
Nephtoah.


10 Thence to the cities of
mount Ephron.


11 Thence to Kiriath-jearim.






1 From Kiriath-jearim
westward it compasseth
unto mount Seir.


2 Thence it passeth along
to the side of mount Iea∣rim,
or Chesalon.


3 Thence went down to
Bethshemesh.


4 Thence passed on to Tim∣nah.


5 Thence unto the side of
Ekron northward.


6 Thence was drawn to
Shichron.


7 Thence passed along to
mount Baalah.


8 Thence went out unto
Iabneel.


9 Thence the west border
ended at the Great Sea.


These west bounds of

Iudah,
 were after∣wards
altered, fal∣ling
into the middest
of the Tribe of 
Dan.









Now, as in the body of a man, if an inspection might be made into it
whilest he is alive, every nerve, and artery therein (then flushed up with
the spirits) is easily to be discerned, which after death shrink almost
invisible, past discovering: so each small angle, and turning of 
Iudah's

bounds in 
Ioshua's
 time, was then plainly to be perceived, which now
adays (the land long since, being in a manner dead, and desolate) are
not at all conspicuous, nor fall they under any accurate observation.


§ 15. Amongst all these limitary places,
 
Kadesh-Barnea
 is onely of
eminency, whither the children of 
Israel
 came, and where they stayed
some time, after their coming out of 
Egypt,
 in the very edge and entrance
of the land of 
Canaan.
 Thus that land was like a rich robe, whose ut∣most
hem the 
Iews
 were permitted to touch (onely that their fingers
might feel the fineness thereof) but were denied to wear it, and remanded
to wander another way many years, for the punishment of their infideli∣ty.
And thus many come to the 
Kadesh-Barnea
 of 
common illumina∣tion,

who never attain to the true 
Canaan
 of holiness here, or happiness
hereafter.


§ 16. In describing this spacious Tribe,
 we will begin with the
eleven royall Cities therein, whose Kings were destroyed by
 
Ioshua.

These according to their dignities may thus be reckoned up:



1 
Ierusalem,
 whereof largely hereafter.


2 Hebron.


3 Debir.


4 Libnah.


5 Lachish.


6 Adullam.


7 Geder.


8 Iarmuth.


9 Eglon.


10 Arad.


11 Hepher.



These royall Cities, though scattered here and there in this Tribe, need
no other Herauld in our map, to proclaime them to the Readers notice,
being quickly found out by their 
coronets
 graven upon them. From
these we shall proceed to other towns of eminency, reserving the rivo∣lets,
and wildernesses, to close this our description.


§ 17. 
Hebron
 was the principall royall city belonging to 
Iudah,
 seven
years
 senior in its building to 
Zoan
 a City in 
Egypt;
 more anciently it
was called 
Kiriath-Arba,
 that is (say
 some) the City of four men, be∣cause
of four Patriarchs (as they reckon them up) 
Adam, Abraham, Isaac,

and 
Iacob
 buried therein. But, I wonder any should delight in their
own wild conjectures, when the text tendereth us a certainty herein,
assuring us that this 
Arba
 (from whom 
Kiriath-Arba,
 or 
Hebron
 was
named) was
 
a great man among the Anakims.
 This City stood in the vale
of 
Mamre,
 so called from
 
Mamre
 a person of quality in this place, who
with 
Aner
 and 
Eshcol
 were 
Abrahams
 loving associates, and valiant assi∣stants,
in conquering 
Cheder-laomer,
 and rescuing the captive 
Sodomites.
Abraham, Isaac,
 and 
Iacob
 lived here successively, and from the 
vale of He∣bron,
Ioseph
 was
 sent on a loving visit to his brethren, when for his good
will they sold him to the 
Ishmaelites.


§ 18. Hereabouts was that great entertainment made,
 wherein the
covert of a
 tree was the dining-room, the ground (probably) the


board, 
Abraham
 the Caterer, 
Sarah
 the Cook, veal and welcome their
cheer, Angels in the shape of men, Christ in the notion of an Angel, the
guests, and the last promise of
 
Isaac
 the free-offering they gave for their
entertainment. Yea, in 
Hebron Isaac
 was born, suckled, weaned, perse∣cuted
by 
Ishmael,
 till at last he mocked both himself, and his mother 
Ha
gar

quite out of his Fathers family.


§ 19. Near 
Hebron
 was the cave of 
Machpelah,
 purchased by 
Abraham

of 
Ephron
 the 
Hittite
 (with the field about it, and all the trees therein)
at the price of four
 hundred shekells of silver, for the burying of 
Sarah,

himself, and his family. For, here,





Isaac


Ishmael


 though
formerly the one perscuted the other lovingly a∣greed to bury Abraham their Father.




Iacob


Esau


 though
formerly the one designed the others death lovingly a∣greed to bury Isaac their Father.


Ioseph
 and
his brethren, though
formerly they envied and sold him, lovingly a∣greed to bury Iacob their Father.



And thus, though branglings, and brawlings may happen betwixt bre∣thren
when young; all animosities ought to be buried in the grave of
their Fathers.


§ 20. In the time of 
Ioshua
 
Hebron
 had a King, whom he conque∣red,

and subdued; and afterwards this place was made a 
City
 
of Refuge,

and assigned (with twelve moe in this Tribe, and 
Benjamin
) unto the

 Priests, the sons of 
Aaron,
 who were above common 
Levites,
 as em∣ployed
in ordinary attendance about the Tabernacle. Herein God pro∣vided
not onely for their conveniency, accommodating them with ha∣bitations
near 
Ierusalem
 (as the place hereafter intended for his publick
service) but chiefly for their conscience, placing 
them
 in these two
Tribes, whom he foresaw would alone persevere in, when the others
would apostate from the true Religion. Yea the Priests had the best and
biggest places in 
Iudah,
 as 
Hebron, Debir, Libnah,
 formerly Royall, after∣wards
Sacerdotall Cities: God allowing his Ministers large main∣tenance;
and indeed a 
beggerly
 Clergy, is the forerunner of a 
bankrupt

Religion.


§ 21. But although the City of 
Hebron
 pertained to the Priests,
 the
suburbs thereof by Gods appointment belonged to
 
Caleb
 and his poste∣rity.
This 
Caleb
 was that young-old man, whose strength contradicted
his years, so able and active at
 fourscore and five, either for advice, or
execution. But here he 
eate not the bread of idleness,
 being first to clear and
conquer 
Hebron
 (before he could possess it) from the 
Giant-Amorite-Anakims

dwelling therein. These 
Amorites,
 though (as the Prophet de∣scribes
them) 
high as the Cedars, and strong as the Oakes,
 had notwith∣standing
(to follow this Metaphor) much wastfull 
sap
 in their mighty
big bodies: whilst 
Caleb (all heart,
 as his name imports) though less
and lower, by Gods assistance easily overcame them. If any demand,
How came 
Anakims
 hither, seeing 
Hebron
 so lately was smitten by 
Ioshua?

A learned
 author answers, that it is probable, whilest 
Ioshua
 after∣wards


was employed in the north in conquering the
 
Canaanites,
 some
remnant of the 
Anakims
 which escaped his hand, did in his absence re∣turn,
possess 
Hebron,
 and put 
Caleb
 to a new task of a second subduing
them.


§ 22. 
David
 afterwards made 
Hebron
 the Metropolis of this king∣dome
(as being the most eminent City of his own Tribe of 
Iudah
)
and reigned almost seven years therein.
 In the third year of his reign

Abner
 repaired hither, with full intent to reduce all 
Israel
 to his obedience,
had not 
Ioabs
 sudden murdering him frustrated his design. Probably
some mixture of jealousie might put 
Ioab
 on this foul action, fearing to
be outed of his office, that if 
Abner
 made 
David
 King, 
David
 would
make 
Abner
 Generall over all 
Israel.
 Certainly, revenge of his brother

Asahels
 bloud prompted him thereunto. 
Ioab
 sending messengers to
fetch 
Abner
 back from the well of 
Siriah,
 slew him treacherously as he
was entering the
 gates of 
Hebron.


§ 23. Forget we not that 
Hebron,
 in the gate whereof 
Ioab
 so basely
and barbarously murdered him, was a 
City of Refuge,
 appointed by God
for the saving of such, as had killed one unawares. Did not 
Ioab
 there∣fore,
in such a place acting wilfull murder, in an high hand relie on his
own greatness to beare him out in so bloudy a deed, as if he neither
feared the justice of man, nor needed the mercy of God? No wonder
then, if many years after he
 flying to the horns of the Altar, was denyed
the protection of that place, who formerly so cruelly, despightfully, and
presumptuously had defiled the 
City of Refuge
 with innocent bloud.


§ 24. Thus died 
Abner,
 very loyall to 
Saul,
 whilest 
Saul
 was living,
and too loving to his
 concubine, when he was dead. Never man
was killed more cowardly, or buried more honourably: 
David
 him∣self

 
following the b
ere,
 weeping as 
chiefe mourner
 at his funerall. In the
same sepulcher the
 head of 
Ishbosheth
 was afterwards interred. Though
some jars were betwixt them whilest living, their dust well agreed in
the same grave. Nor durst the ashes of 
Ishbosheth
 cross the others, who
when alive (though checked, and chidden by him)
 
could not answer Ab∣ner
a word again, because he feared him.
 As for the bodies of 
Baanah
 and 
Re∣chab

the murderers of 
Ishbosheth,
 they had, by order from 
David,
 their
hands and feet cut off, and they hanged up over the
 pool in 
Hebron.


§ 25. After the death of 
Ishbosheth,
 all 
Israel
 repaired to 
Hebron
 to make

David
 their King, whose severall numbers deserve our observation.



1 Out of
 
Iudah
 six
thousand, and eight
hundred.


2 
Simeon,
 seven thou∣sand
& one hundred.


3 
Levi,
 eight thou∣sand
& three hun∣dred
twenty two.


4 
Benjamin,
 three
thousand.


5 
Ephraim,
 twenty
thousand and eight
hundred.


6 
Half Tribe of Ma∣nasseh

on this side

Iordan,
 eighteen
thousand.


7 
Issachar,
 two hun∣dred
officers, and
all their brethren at
ther cōmandment.


8 
Zebulun,
 fifty
thousand.


9 
Naphtali,
 thirty se∣ven

housand, besides
a thousand Captains.


10 
Dan,
 twenty eight
thousand and six
hundred.


11 
,
 fourty
thousand.


12 
Reuben, G
d,

and 
Manass
h

beyond 
Iordan,

an hundred and
twenty thousand.





Behold here those Tribes which lived farthest from 
Hebron,
 appearing
in the highest equipage; as if they endevouring to be revenged on the
distance of their habitation, purposely advanced with the greatest num∣ber.
Here it will be enquired, why 
Iudah
 largest in dominion, next in
position, nearest in relation, (as 
Davids
 native Tribe) made here the
slenderest appearance of all the rest, 
Benjamin
 alone excepted; the thin∣ness
of whose numbers are excused in the text, because
 
hitherto the great∣est
part of them kept the ward of the house of Saul.
 What! doth it fare with

Princes,
 as with 
Prophets,
 that they are not
 
without honour save in their own
Countrey, and in their own house,
 that 
David
 found fewest attendants from his
own Tribe? Oh no, he was abundantly loved, and honoured therein. But,
Tostatus answers


1 
Davids
 daily attendance (both civill in his Court,
and military in his camp, and garrison) hitherto
chiefly consisted of the Tribe of 
Iudah.


2 The rest of 
Iudah
 remained at home, to make
 pro∣vision,
and give entertainment to this confluence of
people from all parts.


Adde hereunto



1 
Six thousand eight hundred
 were a sufficient representa∣tion
of 
Iudah,
 and moe not onely needless, but bur∣densome
for the present, to pester 
Hebron
 too popu∣lous
already. The rest keeping home, and living
hard by, were ready (no doubt) on competent
warning, to come quickly, if need required, or

David
 commanded their attendance.


2 
Iudahs
 main work was done two years before,
when 
David
 was solemnly made their King. And
they now, rather spectators, then actors at his se∣cond
Coronation over all 
Israel.



Now no less politick then thrifty were the other Tribes in bringing
their
 victualls along with them, lest otherwise they should be held as
occasioners of scarcity in 
Iudah,
 and enhauncers of the prices of provi∣sions.


§ 26. Afterwards 
Absalom,
 when he intended a rebellion against his
Father, chose 
Hebron
 as the fittest City, from whence he meant to mount
into the Throne. Hither he came under pretence to doe sacrifice,
 with
his chariots, and horses, and fifty men running before him: but, which
was most to be pitied, he brought with him from 
Ierusalem
 two hun∣dred
men, which were (as one may say) 
Loyall traitors,
 coming in the
simplicity of their hearts, and meerly 
drawn-in
 to treasonable practises.
But 
Hebron
 proved not a place so succesfull to 
Absalom
 the son, as former∣ly
fortunate to 
David
 his father. This Traitours soveraignty soon ex∣pired,
when forsaken of 
God, Man,
 and 
Beast
 (his own Mule going a∣way
from him) he was slain of 
Ioab,
 as
 formerly related.


§ 27. Some ten miles south of 
Hebron
 lay 
Debir,
 anciently called



Kiriah-Sepher
, 
the City of a book,
 conceived a 
Canaanitish
 University. And
although the Giant 
Anakims
 dwelling hereabouts, may be presumed but
little 
bookish,
 yet civilized Countreys, in all ages, have allowed such places
for the education of youth, who are better unborn, then unbred. 
Caleb

proffered
 
Acsah
 his daughter in marriage to any one that should con∣quer
this City, which was accordingly performed by 
Othniel
 his youn∣ger
brothers son, and first Judge of 
Israel.
 What, were not the glory of
God, and good of his Countrey, enough to set an edge on his valour,
but the promise of a wife needed also to whet his resolution? No doubt
the scales of his resolution went down formerly on the right side, before
this match was cast in as 
overweight.
 It is no unlawfull Bigamy of the
soul, when wedded to Gods glory in the first place, to embrace also
therewith the
 
recompense of reward:
 and grand is the difference betwixt
an
 
hireling
 whose minde is meerly mercenary, and him that works for
his hire; with 
Othniel
 taking it (not as the main 
motive,
 much less as the

end,
 but) onely as a welcome encouragement of his undertakings.


§ 28. Thus all parties were pleased;
 
Israel
 recovered 
Debir, Othniel

got 
Acsah
 to wife, 
she
 gained a blessing from her Father, that blessing
brought the possession of the 
upper,
 and 
nether springs
 along with it.
Know also, in after ages the south part of 
Iudah
 was called 
Caleb,
 proba∣bly
from the large inheritance, 
Caleb
 obtained in these parts, and puis∣sance
of his posterity therein. Thus the 
Egyptian
 giving an account of the
passages of the army of the 
Amalekites,
 confesseth they had been roving
upon 
the coast that belonged to Iudah, and upon the south of
 Caleb.


§ 29. 
Libnah
 is the third in honour,
 of the nine royall Cities in the
days of 
Ioshua,
 assigned afterwards for the Priests habitation. Long it
continued loyall to the Crown of 
Iudah,
 untill in the days of 
Iehoram
 (that
ungodly, unmercifull, unsuccesfull, unbeloved, unlamented King) 
Edom
revolted from under the hand of Iudah, unto this day, then Libnah
 revolted at the same
time.
 Was it casualty, or confederacy (by mutuall intelligence) that both
thir defections bare the same date? Surely, 
breach of faith
 is a catching disease,
yea infectious from one to another. But, how could the inhabitants of

Libnah,
 being Priests, (whose best livelyhood depended on their per∣sonall
officiating in the Temple at 
Ierusalem
) subsist, being cut off from
their service, and the salary thereof? Yea, did they not thereby necessari∣ly
apostate from their religion to God, desert his Temple and their own
profession? Except any will say (easier spoken, then proved) that at
this present, not the Priests, but some other persons were possessours of

Libnah.
 We finde not this City afterwards reduced to the Kings of 
Iudah,

whereupon some
 conceive, that henceforward it stood on its own
bottome, as an absolute Common-wealth.


§ 30. If any object it impossible, that 
Libnah
 so small a City, should
subsist here as a free State against all the powers of the Kings of 
Iudah;

let such look on little 
Lucca,
 in 
Italy,
 and less 
Geneva,
 in 
France,
 defended


by their foes from their foes; environed with enemies on all sides, yet
so, that rather then any one shall subdue them, all the rest will assist
them. Such probably, was the position, and politick State-poizing of

Libnah,
 seated in the vicinity of the Kings of 
Iudah, Israel,
 and the 
Philistines,

(not to say, 
Egypt,
 though far off, might come in as a protectour thereof)
that it might make a Cordiall of a self-subsistance, from the Antidotes
of its enemies. Afterwards we finde
 
Sennacherib
 fighting against 
Lib∣nah

(whence he sent a railing message to 
Hezekiah
) but read nothing of
the taking thereof; yea, probably here the
 
Angel
 by night did that me∣morable
excution, slaying an hundred fourscore and five thousand of his
numerous army.


§ 31. 
Lachish
 must not be forgotten,
 whose
 King was destroyed by 
Io∣shua.

King 
Amaziah
 conspired against by his subjects in 
Ierusalem,
 fled hi∣ther
in vain; for, 
They sent after him to Lachish, and slew him
 there.
 It was a

leading
 City in Idolatry, infected from 
Israel,
 and infecting of 
Iudah.
 
Micah

prophesied in particular against this City, warning it to prepare for spee∣dy
captivity from its enemies.
 
O thou inhabitant of Lachish, binde the charet to
the swift beast; she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the trans∣gressions
of Israel were found in thee.
 And although we finde not 
Lachish
 ta∣ken
by 
Sennacherib
 who
 warred against it, yet it escaped not the fury of

Nebuchadnezzar,
 though one of the
 last Cities by him subdued.


§ 32. But 
Ad
llam,
 another regall City in 
Iudah,
 was more ancient;
where
 
Hirah, Iudah's
 fast friend, dwelt, though employed by him but
as a 
pandar post factum,
 to carry 
Tamar
 the hire of her whoredome. In a
cave hereabouts repaired to
 
David, every one that
 was 
in distress, and every
one that
 was 
in debt, and every one that
 was 
discontented, and he became a Captain
over them.
 Was this well done of him to be 
Protector Generall of Out-laws,

thereby defying justice, defrauding creditours, defeating Gods com∣mand,
which provided, that the deb
er, if not solveable, should be
 sold
for satisfaction? Alas, his need is all that can be alleadged in his excuse.
Sure I am 
David
 promised (when in power to make his own choice)
that his houshold, or Court, should consist of persons better qualified.
However these men freely resorting to him, were better then those hired
by 
Abimelech,
 
vain and light persons,
 and as far to be preferred before them
as want is more excusable then wickedness. Yea, we may charitably
believe 
Davids
 consorts impoverisht not by their own 
carelesness,
 but
their creditors 
cruelty.


§ 33. As for 
Gedar
 it hath formerly been described in 
Simeon,
 onely
we will adde, that
 
Baal-hanan
 the 
Gederite
 was of this place, 
Davids

Overseer 
over the Olive trees, and Sycamore trees in the low plain.
 This name of

Baal-hanan
 inverted is the same with 
Hannibal
 that great Generall of the

Carthaginians.
 See here the affinity of the 
Hebrew,
 with the 
Phoenician,
 or 
Car∣thaginian
tongue.
 Wonder not that 
Baal-hanan,
 or 
Hannibal
 was a fashi∣onable
name for potent persons in these parts, (we finde also a King of



Edom
 so called) seeing it signifieth 
a Lord in grace,
 or, 
favour;
 and our
Saviour hath told us, 
such as exercise authority over others are called
 Gracious
Lords.
 As for 
I
rmuth, Eglon,
 and 
Arad,
 we read nothing of them remark∣able,
since their severall Kings were destroied by 
Ioshua.
 Of 
Hepher
 we
shall speak more properly in the close of this Description.


§ And now,
 what a fall must our Description have, from the Cities
of Kings, to the Manor of a clown; the fruitfull 
Carmell
 not far from
the Dead-sea? Here folly, and wisdome dwelt under the same roof,
sate at the same table, slept in the same bed, 
Nabal
 and 
Abigail.
 Are
matches made in heaven, and was 
Abigail
 so ill beloved there, to be con∣demned
to such a choice? Surely, God saw it most for his own glory
and her good, for the emprovement of her patience. This 
Nabal
 pro∣ved
himself a perfect Miser, both by his niggardliness to 
David,
 and pro∣digality
of the
 King-like dinner he made to his shepheards. But both
he and his family had been utterly destroyed by 
David,
 had not the dis∣creet
mediation of 
Abigail
 been seasonably interposed.


§ 35. After his gluttonous supper 
Abigail
 next morning serves 
Nabal

with a thrifty breakfast,
 telling him of the great danger he so narrowly
had escaped. Hereupon
 
his heart dyed within him.
 Thus some drunkards
have been said to have swooned when sober, at the serious review of
such perils they so neerly escaped in the fits of their distemper. Proba∣bly
feare encreased his sadness, suspecting to fall into a relapse of 
Davids

disfavour, and that his anger might revert to give him another visite
hereafter. Thus the 
wrath
 
of a King
 (though but in reversion) 
is as the
roaring of a Lion.
 Yea, 
Nabal
 became as a stone, and no wonder, being
little better then a stock before, such his senseless stupidity. But, though
he was a churl in his miserable living, he was bountifull in his season∣able
dying, freeing 
Abigail
 from an unequall yoke, and fitting her with
an husband better suiting with her deserts, even 
David
 himself.


§ 36. But,
 
Carmel
 had not such a fool, but that
 
Giloh
 hard by had as
wise a man for the owner thereof, even oraculous 
Ahithophel.
 This was
he that gave the wholesomest, but 
Hushai
 the toothsomest counsell to

Absalom,
 best pleasing the palate of a vainglorious traitour. 
Ahithophel
 ad∣vised
as 
a cruel hunter,
 that 
David
 should presently be
 pursued, not giving
him any breath, but either running him down outright, or killing
him in the 
form,
 where they should finde him: 
Hushai
 counselled to
prolong the sport for their greater pleasure; and, seeing all the 
game
 was
surely in their own hand, to give 
David
 the larger 
law,
 to shift away a
while for himself, that so he might be put to death in the greater state,
and with more ceremonious magnificence. 
Ahithophel
 seeing his coun∣sell
neglected at Court, and foreseeing (in the causes) 
Absaloms
 ruin, and

Davids
 return, to prevent farther shame, and save the executioner the
paines, fairly went home, set his house in order, and
 hanged himself.


§ 37. 
Tekoah
 is not far off,
 where a wise woman once lived (the subtilest


subtilest
 manager of 
Ioabs
 design to 
David,
 for the bringing back of 
Ab∣salom
)
and a wiser man
 
Amos,
 called from an heardsman, and a gather∣er
of wild figs to be a Prophet. Near 
Tekoah Iehosaphat
 obtained a me∣morable
victory against the children of 
Ammon, Moab,
 and Mount 
Seir,

though at the first hearing of their coming, 
Iehosaphat
 is said to have been

 
affraid.
 Did he not discover much cowardice herein, considering what
multitudes of men 
Iehosaphat
 at that time did command? Namely,



1 
Under
 Adnah the chief of Iudah three hundred thousand mighty men of
valour.


2 Next to him
 Iehohanan captain over two hundred and fourscore thousand.


3 Next him
 Amaziah with two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.


4 And of Benjamin
 Eliada with two hundred thousand armed with bow and
shield.


5 Next him
 Iehoshabad with an hundred and fourscore thousand ready pre∣pared
for the war.



What need then 
Iehosaphat
 fear (except as in 
Gideons
 case suspecting he had
too
 many for God to give victory by) having an Army (if well disci∣plined
with advantage of time and place) able to to encounter all man∣kind,
especially on the defensive side, to make good their own Countrey
against any invasion?


§ 38. It is answered,
 the suddenness of the news might adde much
to his fright, that an enemy was come into the bowels of his Countrey

 [
Behold they be in Hazeron-Tamar, which is Engedi]
 before the first intelli∣gence
was brought thereof. Secondly, 
Iehosaphat
 feared not so much
his foes, as his faults, guilty to himself of great offences, (good men the
less sinfull; the more sensible thereof) and chiefly of his matching at
home, and marching abroad with the Idolatrous family of 
Ahab.
 Last∣ly,
those vast numbers of his souldiers lately specified, were not all at
any
 one time, but severally, and successively, during the five and
twenty years of 
Iehosaphat
 his reign. Wherefore those words in the list
of 
Iehosaphat's
 Generalls thrice repeated, 
Next him, Next him, Next him,

imply not a gradation in honour, as if all of them, though subordinate∣ly,
were extant together, but import a succession of time, the latter en∣tering
with his men on the office of a Generall, after the displacing, or
death of the former.


§ 39. However,
 
Iehosaphat
 puts his people into a penitent posture,
falling to fasting and prayer, and obtains a memorable conquest, which
was purely heavens 
Donative, Sine cura,
 without mans care, cost, or charge
to atchieve it. Prince and people stand still, look on, believe God, sing
Psalmes, accounting their conquest gotten, because promised by the
Prophet. Mean time, their enemies amazed with
 ambushments of
Gods setting, fall foul one on another, till 
Moab,
 and 
Ammon
 had de∣stroyed,
first the 
Edomites,
 then themselves. Three days are the men of

Iudah
 employed in gathering the spoile, and so return to 
Ierusalem
 with


wealth in their hands, joy in their hearts, musick in their mouths, ha∣ving
left behind them the name of
 
Berachah,
 or 
blessing,
 imposed on the
place, where this celestiall victory was bestowed upon them.


§ 40. But now it is high time that we enter on the severall Stages and
removalls of 
David
 in or near this Tribe,
 after that he (having formerly
suffered much from 
Saul
 as a private person) began to 
Prince it,
 and to 
stand
on his guard.
 The text saith he and his men went
 
wheresoever they could go.
David
 herein being like the Son and Lord of 
David, who
 had not where to
lay his head.
 Indeed 
David
 confesseth that God made the 
stony rocks for the

 Conies,
 but yet he himself was glad to be their 
In-mate,
 and share with
them in their
 habitations; and yet his soul was never so discomposed
in any hole or cave, but that in the darkest of them he could see to make

Psalmes,
 and praise his 
Maker.
 No place came amiss to his pious soul,
above or under ground, all alike to him to serve his God therein. Now
seeing it is 
Davids
 expression of himself, that he was hunted 
as a
 
Par∣tridge
on the mountains: Partridge,
 a bird innocent whose fine flesh is its grea∣test
guilt, and importent, (not armed with beak or talons) whose chiefe
might consisteth in the flight thereof: Now whilest 
Saul
 followed him,
we will follow 
Davids
 Metaphore in our ensuing description. But be
it premised, that 
Saul
 was no fair Faulconer, who more desiring the prey
then the sport, came with his nets and setting dogs, with full intent to
kill 
David
 wherever he might catch him.


§ 41. We begin at the cave of 
Adullam
 (which we may call his nest)
wherein he composed the fifty seventh,
 and the hundreth fourty second

Psalme.
 Hence he made wing, taking a long and strong flight to

Mizpah
 in the land of 
Moab.
 Here the 
Partridge
 shewed much of the 
Stork

in him, feeding his parents, and taking order with the King of 
Moab
 for
the maintenance of his
 Father and mother.


§ 42. Hence (by the advice of the Prophet
 
Gad,
 not to trust him∣self
again in the cave of 
Adullam
) by 
the forest of
 
Hareth
 to the City of

Keilah.
 The Inhabitants whereof 
David
 had lately obliged to himself, by
saving them from the 
Philistines,
 notwithstanding which favour, God
assured him of their intentions to
 betray him to 
Saul.
 If a skilfull
Gardiner can in the depth of winter, by beholding the bare root, and
knowing the 
kind thereof,
 foretell when and what flowers the same
will bring forth many moneths after, well may the God of heaven, the

searcher of hearts,
 know mens
 
thoughts afar off,
 and infallibly conclude
what they will be, before they have any being. Base 
Keilites,
 who had
rather pick thanks with 
Saul,
 then pay thanks to 
David
 to whom they
were due! Thus deliver an ungratefull man from a danger, and he will
be the first to bring you into the same condition. This sad occasion
did spring the Partridge hence.


§ 43. To 
Hachilah hill in a wood in the wilderness of Ziph,
 south of Iesimon.
 Here

Ionathan
 came and renewed his amity with 
David.
 Behold how they


two 
is
 embracing one another, (Reader my phrase trespasseth on the
rules of 
Grammar,
 no
 of 
friendship
) and 
made a Covenant before the Lord
 Nor
was it a small comfort to 
David,
 (though 
Saul,
 and 
Doeg,
 and 
Keilites,
 and

Ziphites
 were against him) that, besides his own innocence, he had the

Prince,
 the 
Priest,
 and the 
Prophet, Ionathan, Abiathar,
 and 
Gad,
 good mens
prayers, and Gods providence on his side. Here the 
Ziphites, Sauls setters,

having winded 
David; Saul;
 to catch him, comes with his net, but ei∣ther
made too much noise, or too little speed, for before he came thither
the Partridge was flown.


§ 44. To 
the wilderness of Maon.
 Here onely a mountain was betwixt

David
 and 
Saul,
 and that not long likely to keep them asunder, seeing

Sauls
 men, being many in number, began to compass 
David
 round a∣bout.
But seasonable ill news was brought that the
 
Philistines
 had in∣vaded
the land, which made 
Saul
 turn his forces another way against
a forein foe. Commendable his ingenuity, that he preferred rather to op∣pose
an enemy of another Religion, then to dispatch a domestick ad∣versary,
whom he now had at advantage. However judicious eyes behold
not this as an act of 
Sauls
 pity, but Gods providence: hereupon 
David

called the place 
Sela-hammahlekoth,
 or 
the rock of Division.


§ 45. Hence he fled to the holds at 
Engedi:
 Here he had 
Saul
 in a cave,
and was seemingly courted by heaven, certainly urged by
 men to de∣stroy
him, and yet he refused. O why is a golden opportunity put into
a leaden hand, which wants activity to make use of it? What hard
heart could have thrust away so fair an advantage? But oh, (though all
things else were here) one thing was wanting, a 
Lawfull command.
 A
Crown is over bought which costs a sin. 
David
 durst not kill him, one∣ly
he cut off the skirt of his garment, and withall felt a greater gash in
his
 conscience, then he made in 
Sauls
 clothes, for being too bold with
Gods Anointed. This courtesie of 
David
 in sparing his life, made 
Saul

half a convert, drawing
 tears from his eyes, fair words from his mouth,
but what intentions from his heart, 
He
 onely knows, that knew the
secrets thereof. It is suspicious that 
Sauls
 truth therein was not much, be∣cause

Davids
 trust therein was none at all; who (notwithstanding the

Court-holy-water
 of 
Sauls
 tears) gat him and his men again 
up into the


hold.


§ 46. Hence 
David
 took a voluntary flight unto 
Carmel.
 Here the

Partridge
 was like to turn 
Hauke,
 and become a 
Bird of prey,
 to kill all the
the innocent family of
 
Nabal,
 (as we have already observed) had not
that God who formerly protected him from 
Sauls,
 here preserved him
from his own sword, and 
from
 
avenging himself with his own hand.


§ 47. Hence he fled back again to 
Hachilah
 hill,
 which is before 
Iesi∣mon.

Here the 
Ziphites
 bring 
Saul
 second tidings of his being there. So
boundless was the stock of their malice, no danger of 
breaking,
 who
though they failed at their first return, would adventure again. Onely


thei
 malice did this good, that it gave 
David
 the occasion to make the
fifty fourth Psalme. Here he had 
Saul
 at a second advantage, finding him
with 
Abner
 and his men round about him 
fast
 
asleep,
 even as still as the
Spear and Cruse of water that stood at his head. These 
David
 took away,
but with intent truly to restore them after he had kept them a while 

monuments of his own integrity. Hereupon 
Saul▪
 a second Convert,
clears 
David,
 chargeth himself, prayeth for pardon, and promiseth a∣mendment,
whilest 
David
 having had experience of his former fals∣hood,
gives him the hearing, not the beleeving. For


§ 48. Hence he flew to 
Gath
 in the land of the 
Philistines,
 and
 
Saul
sought no more again for him,
 leaving off his pursuit now the Partridge had
took 
Covert
 in an enemies Countrey; whence he removed to 
Ziglag,
 and
thence made many incursions against the
 
Geshurites, Gezrites,
 and 
Ama∣lekites▪

but withall telling King 
Achish
 that he matched the clean contrary
way against 
Iudah
 and the friends thereof. Here the 
Partridge
 had in
him too much of the 
Lapwing,
 which by its hypocriticall fluttering pre∣tends
its nest far distant from the true place thereof. Such dissimulation
in 
David
 cannot be excused, must not be imitated. From 
Ziglag
 he mar∣ched
along with 
Achish
 King of 
Gath
 to 
Aphek
 in the Tribe of 
Issachar,

where he was dismissed and
 cashiered by the 
Philistines
 from any further
service. Returning home he found 
Ziglag
 his nest spoiled, yea all his

Covie
 therein (wives and children) catched in a snare, as hath for∣merly
been described in the Tribe of 
Simeon.
 After the recovery of his
losses, from 
Ziglag


§ 49. He flew to 
Hebron▪
 Here the 
Partridge
 turned 
Eagle,
 being
solemnly made Soveraign first of 
Iudah,
 then of all 
Israel.
 And now be∣ing
quietly setled in his Throne, he may joyfully sing, 
Many are the af∣flictions
of the
 
righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.


§ 50. But besides these eminent and noted 
Gests
 of 
David
 he had
many more which were obscure and intermediate,
 as appears by the

list
 of the places
 
where he haunted,
 and to whom he sent part of his spoils
taken from the 
Amalekites, viz.




1 Bethel 
in
 Benja∣min.


2 South Ramoth 
in

Simeon.


3 Iattir 
in
 Iudah 
a

Levites 
City.


4 
Aroer
 in the tribe
of 
Gad.


5
 Siphmoth.


6 Eshtemoa 
a
 Levites

City in
 Iudah.


7 Rachal.


8 Cities of the Ierah∣meelites,
(
descended
from
 Iarahmeel 
an

eminent man in

Iudah.)


9 Cities of the 
Kenites.


10 Hormah 
in
 Simeon.


11 Chorashan 
in
 Simeon.


in
 Iudah.


12 Athach.


13 Hebron, 
e∣minent in
 Iudah.



As for 
Siphmoth, Rachal,
 and 
Athach,
 because they appear not again in
Scripture, their position is unknown, but may be presumed in or near


the Tribe of 
Iudah.
 The best is, though our tracing of 
Davids
 travels
may be imperfect, and we fail in the reckoning thereof, yet Gods Arith∣metick
is exact, and what is defective in our's, is supplied in his obser∣vations:

 
Thou tellest my wanderings, put my tears in thy bottle, are they not
written in thy book?


§ 51. Now besides the Cities mentioned in our description▪
 many
more remain which were obscure, without any memorable act atchie∣ved
in them: and are thus reckoned up in 
Ioshua.




1 Towards the coast of 
Edom

south-ward,
 
twenty nine.


2 In the vale,



 
Fourteen
 in the first▪


 
Sixteen
 in the second,


 
Nine
 in the third,



Cata∣logue.






3 On the Sea two,
 
Ekron
 and

Ashdod.


4 In the mountains,



 
Eleven
 in the first,


 
Nine
 in the second,


 
Ten
 in the third,


 
Six
 in the fourth,



Cata∣logue.






5 
Two
 by themselves, 
Kiriath-Baal
 and

Rabbah.


6 In the wilderness, 
Six.




In all an hundred and fourteen.


So that the Tribe of 
Iudah
 alone had more Cities then all the Island
of 
Crete,
 which had but just an hundred, and therefore called 
Hecatom∣polis.

But many of these Cities were small, and a good share of them
was given to the Tribes of 
Dan
 and 
Simeon,
 as formerly hath been ob∣served.
But amongst such as remained to 
Iudah
 let not
 
Maresha
 be for∣gotten,
(in the north-west part of this Tribe) both because thereby, in

the valley of Zephathah, Asa
 conquered
 
Zerah
 the 
Ethiopian,
 whose army
consisted of more then a million of men, and because the Prophet
 
Mi∣cah

was born therein.


§ 52. In Saint 
Hieromes
 time somewhere in 
Iudah
 flourished a fair
City called 
Eleutheropolis:
 from which that
 Father measureth the di∣stance
of most southern places in 
Palestine;
 as he computeth the 
northern

from 
Legion
 a City in 
Galilee.
 But (the more the pity) that Father hath
not acquainted us with the exact location of either of these two places.
Whilest 
Adrichomius
 and others condemn Saint 
Hieromes
 carelesness
herein, it better befits us to condole our own unhappiness, who can∣not
read the accurate distance of places in his book of that subject, be∣cause
though he have lent us his 
Characters,
 he hath not left us the true

Key
 thereof.


§ 53. The Tribe of 
Iudah
 had no great river therein,
 saving a little
piece of gasping 
Iordan
 now ready to expire in the 
dead-sea;
 but with
rivolets it was sufficiently stored, lending the brooks of 
Sorek
 and 
Bez
r

to 
Dan
 and 
Simeon;
 borrowing 
Kedron
 from 
Benjamin,
 whence it fetch∣eth
its fountain▪ and keeping the brook 
before the wilderness of
 
Ieruel

wholly for its own use, as rising, running, and falling entirely in this
Tribe. Nor must that brook be forgotten, which I may call the



brook of David,
 because being to encounter 
Goliah,
 he took thence
 five

smooth stones (store is no sore,
 especially not being sure, but his first might
faile) and furnished his scrip therewith.


§ 54. This was that 
Goliah
 whose 
strength
 was equall to his 
stature,

his 
armes
 sutable to his 
strength,
 but his 
Pride
 above all. Betwixt him and

David
 first passed a tongue-combate. The one discharging ostentation,
and presumption, which the other as quickly returned with faith and
confidence in Gods promises. Come they then to encounter: see the
lower man had the longer arme, who with his sling could reach death
at distance to his adversary. The beaver of 
Goliahs
 helmet was open:
not that he thought his brazen brow sufficiently armed with its own
impudence, but either that he might see, breath, and boast the more
freely, or because he disdained to 
buckle
 himself against so unequall
a match: The stone from 
Davids
 sling flies directly to his forehead,
whereby the Giant is mortally wounded, and notwithstanding his

speare was as great as a
 
weavers beame,
 his life was 
swifter then a
 
weavers
shuttle; so soon passed it away and he was gone, David
 cutting off his head
with his own sword.


§ 55. Many were the wildernesses in this Tribe,
 as those of

 
Zin,
 
Ziph,
 
Maon,
 
Engedi,
 
Ieruel,
 
Tekoa,
 and
 
Iudah
 lying
south of 
Arad.
 Now as once it was the question of the Disciples
to our Saviour, 
From
 
whence can a man satisfie these men with bread
here in the wilderness?
 So here it may materially be demanded, Where
did the men of 
Iudah
 finde food to sustain themselves, whose coun∣trey
seems a heap of wildernesses cast together? Here we must
know that the whole land of 
Palestine
 was drest and kept like a
garden plot, and inclosed into Olive-yards, Vine-yards, and ara∣ble
fields, save some extravagant places which lay common, where
wild beasts did harbour in the woods, commonly called 
Wilder∣nesses.

Such notwithstanding were full of fruitfull
 pastures, and had
fair
 towns, though more thinly inhabited then other parts of the
Countrey; so that this Tribe was more frighted then hurt with the
multitude of 
Wildernesses
 therein.


§ 56. Paramount over them all was 
The wilderness,
 having six
Cities therein, and was part of 
the
 
wilderness of Iudea,
 (extending
also into 
Benjamin
) wherein 
Iohn the Baptist
 preached: feeding here
on 
Locusts
 (flying insects,
 whereof four kindes were clean, and
permitted the 
Iews
 to eate) and 
wilde honey.
 Either such as fell down
in
 dews from heaven, or was made by wild Bees, not civilized
in hives, but nesting on the ground or in hollow trees. In a word,
he was content with such course fare as the Countrey afforded, his
rough clothes being suited to his homely diet, and both to his hard
doctrine of Repentance. Hereupon scandalous tongues condemned
him for 
having a
 
Devill,
 as afterwards they belyed our Saviour


(using a more liberal diet) to be a 
Winebibber,
 so impossible it is
to please affected frowardness either 
full
 or 
fasting.


§ 57. Some make 
Iohn Baptist
 the first founder of 
Eremites.
 But
how little his precedent befriendeth their practise, who, not out
of any impulsion, but meer election, delight to dwell in deserts, will
appear by the ensuing Parallel.



Hee,


1 By immediate com∣mand
from God to
fulfill the prophecy
of
 
Isaiah.


2 Went into a wilder∣ness;
a place more
thinly peopled then
the rest of the land.


3 Where he daily bu∣sied
himself with
preaching to multi∣tudes
of people re∣pairing
unto him.


4 And at last did end
his life in a place of
greater concourse,
even the
 Court of
King 
Herod
 himself.




They,


1 By dictates of their own
fancy, following the
principles of will-wor∣ship.


2 Goe into a wilder∣ness
indeed, conversing
with solitariness, and
shunning all socie∣ty.


3 Where they bury them∣selves
alive in laziness
with the talents God
hath bestowed on
them.


4 And binde themselves
with a vow to live and
dye in that solitary con∣dition.



Behold here the large difference betwixt him and monking 
Eremites.

Who, if men of parts, ought to help others with their society;
if of no parts, need to be helped by the society of others. Yea
whatsoever their endowments were, this running into the wilder∣ness
was but a 
Bank-rupt trick,
 to defraud the Church and Com∣mon-wealth
their Creditours, to both which they stood bound by
specialty of Gods command to discharge all Civill and Christian
relations to the utmost proportions of their abilities. In a word,
though we stedfastly beleeve, that 
Iabal was the father of all such
as dwell in tents,
 because the Scripture
 affirmeth the same, yet for
the reasons aforesaid, we utterly deny 
Iohn Baptist
 the founder and
Author of all those which live wilfully in hills and holes an eremiticall
life.


§ 58. The Son of 
Hese
 was 
Solomons
 Purveyor in
 
Aruboth,

to him belonged 
Sochoth,
 and all the land of 
Hepher.
 A land which
lay, as we gather by other proportions, in the north-west part of
this Tribe. And indeed we finde a King of 
Hepher
 amongst those


which 
Ioshua
 destroyed, but dare not confidently averre him to have
been of the Tribe of
 
Iudah.
 However, it appears that for the main,
the whole body of the Tribe of 
Iudah
 (with 
Simeon
 lying therein)
fell not under any of 
Solomons
 Purveyour-ships. The reason where∣of,
if inquired into, may perchance be reduced into some of these con∣siderations.



1 It was referred to defray extraordinaries, on casuall enter∣tainments,
and occasionall solemnities; or


2 It was kept for the expences of the thirteenth, or inter∣calary
moneth (the product of the eleven supernumerary
days) which commonly was every third year inserted into
the Hebrew
 Kalendar.


3 
Iudah
 might by speciall indulgence be exempted from such
taxations; either because 
Ierusalem,
 the royall City, was
principally seated therein; and therefore to prevent scarcity
of victualls in so populous a place, the Court-purveyours
went further off, that the City might be better provided;
or, because 
Solomon
 did ease, and favour that Tribe, whence
he himself was extracted.



This very probably was some cause, why, when the other ten
Tribes, grinded with grievous oppressions, deserted the house of

David, Iudah
 alone, as having formerly tasted of his Fathers favour,
entirely clave to 
Rehoboam.


§ 59. The armes of 
Iudah
 are 
Gules, a Lion couchant Or,
 according
to 
Iacobs
 prediction, 
Iudah he stooped down, he couched as a
 Lion, and as
an old Lion, who shall rouze him up?
 This is a posture which that
princely beast is pleased to accept for his own ease: otherwise no
chastisement shall impose it on him, no force but his own free plea∣sure
can make him to crouch. The Analogy is obvious to every eye,
the Lion being 
the
 
strongest amongst beasts, which turneth not away for any.

As 
Iudah
 was 
the chief of Tribes
 for number, strength and largeness of
possessions, and the 
Tribe of Chiefes,
 so many Kings, yea Christ himself
according to the flesh deriving his extraction from the same.








Here the Map of the Land of 
Moriah
 is to be inserted.













THE LAND OF MORIAH. CHAP. 14.


§ 1. 
B
Ecause the Countrey about 
Ierusalem
 is very fruitfull
of observable places,
 it is therefore here presented
in an intire Map. Nor do we meet with a fitter,
and more adequate name to express the same, then
to style it 
The land of Moriah,
 as it is named in Scri∣pture:

 Herein we shall onely insist on signall
places of certain truth; otherwise the work would be almost infinite:
for what is said of the people of 
Israel,
 
There shall not one be barren amongst
them,
 is true of every petty place near 
Ierusalem,
 not a Hill, Hole, Stick,
Stone, Cave, Grave, but is pregnant with some History, and vulgar be∣liefe
is the Midwife to deliver it; we will therefore confine our selves
to Scripture alone in our following description.


§ 2. We begin with the 
Brook of Kidron:
 which we may call the 
Brook
of Reformation;
 for often the current thereof carried away the Reliques
of Idolatry; once when the Idol of his grandmother 
Maachah
 was by
King 
Asa
 
burnt by the banks thereof;
 Again, when
 in 
Hezekiahs
 time the
people (no doubt by his command) threw the Idolatrous Altars there∣in.
Thirdly, when the dust of the 
Altars
 erected by King 
Manasses,
 was
by 
Iosiah, cast into the channel of
 
Kidron.
 I dare boldly say that the water
of this brook, was no whit the less the sweet in taste, or clear in colour
for washing away these monuments of superstition. However this

Kidron
 may be ranked amongst those Rivolets whereof
 
Iob
 speaks, 
My
brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook and as a stream of brooks which passeth a∣way;

not that the water onely slideth away, other succeeding in the room
thereof (which is common to the greatest channels) but this very 
Brook

it self slides away in the Summer and is dryed up, as having no fountain
to feed it, but the waters running down from 
Mount Olivet;
 Thus 
Kidron

is the too lively emblem of our 
ouls, which having no naturall spring


of goodness in themselves, flow no longer then they are watered from
above, with the infusion of celestiall Grace.


§ 3. This Brook runs through the 
Valley of Iehosaphat,
 being a hollow
dale interposed betwixt 
Ierusalem
 and 
Mount Olivet,
 but why so named I
finde no satisfactory reason alledged; for I cannot agree to what gene∣rally
is reported, that in this place 
Iehosaphat
 got his miraculous victory
over the
 
Edomites, Moabites
 and 
Ammonites:
 because on serious perusall
of the text, that battell appears fought far off in the wilderness of 
Tekoah.

Many are of opinion, that as 
Mount Olivet
 shall be the Tribunall, erected
for the Judge; so this 
Vale of Iehosaphat
 shall be the Gaol and Bar where
all offenders at the last day shall be arraigned, founding their conceit
partly on the words of the Prophet
 
Ioel, I will also gather all Nations, and
bring them down into the valley of Iehosaphat, and will plead with them there for my
people;
 partly on the expression of the Angels to the Disciples after 
Christs

ascension,
 
that in the same manner he should return again.
 But these are too
low, carnall, and restrictive conceits of Gods glorious judiciall pro∣ceedings▪
it being improbable he would appoint the certain particular

place,
 who in his wisdome hath caused the 
time
 to be concealed; yea
if one day be as a thousand years with God, why may not, according to
the same proportion, the whole earth be meant by the 
Valley of Iehosaphat?

Wherefore waving curious inquiries about the circumstances belong∣ing
onely to the Judge to assigne, let us carefully provide our selves for
those Assises, the proper work for us to performe▪


§ 4. In this 
Vale of Iehosaphat,
 on the other side of 
Kidron
 stood the
village of 
Gethsemane,
 so called in Hebrew for the plenty of Oile, that there
was pressed out: But a far more precious liquor was once afforded in
this place, which in the Garden hard by, fell from our Saviours face in
his Agony,
 
Clods of sweat like bloud:
 Surely the hea
 of the weather had
no influence on this his distemper: being the open aire, in so cold a
night, that the stout servants of the high Priest, though housed in a Hall,
found need of a fire to warm themselves thereat.
 It was not then with∣out
cause that the 
paschall Lambe
 was commanded to be eaten, neither raw
nor sodden with water, but rosted with fire, as 
Christ,
 the tr
th
 of this
Type, was at this time bathed in his own sweat. Here 
Christ
 thrice con∣ditionally
begged, 
that his 
up might pass away,
 preferring three severall
short prayers, before one entire continued petition; partly that in a tripled
suit his importunity might be more conspicuous: partly, to get breath,
and gain strength in the intervalls: and partly, in the same time to visit
his Disciples, being never so busie about himself, but he was still at lea∣sure
to look how it fared with them.


§ 5. Hither into this 
Garden
 repaired 
Iudas
 in the night time
 
with
Lanthornes and Torches,
 (no more light then needed in such a deed of dark∣ness,
otherwise it had been superfluous to seek the Sun it self with a
Lanthorn) to betray our Saviour; bringing with him 
a band of souldiers



(too many to attach Christ as meer man, too few to encounter him as
God) 
from the high Priest,
 gown-men, sword-men, young, old, 
Iew,
Gentile,
 all contriving his death, as all sorts and conditions of people
were afterward to reap benefit thereby: at the first all
 
fell flat down
 at the
sound of his voice, demanding of them, 
whom seek yee?
 If the report of a
bare question gave such a blow, ô had his mouth been charged with
a curse against them, what execution would it have done! Here 
Peters

wild love almost had done our 
Saviour
 that harm, which the malice of
his enemies might despaire to effect, by making him guilty not onely o

the breach of peace, but of a plain Riot, by that dangerous wound he
gave unto 
Malchus▪
 whereby no doubt he had invited many swords about
his own ears, had not the miracle of 
Christs
 quick cure restrained them▪
This was that 
Peter
 now so forward to draw his weapon, from whom
afterward a word could not be drawn in acknowledgement of his Ma∣ster;
so unequally bea
s the pulse of blind zeal, either too fast, or not
at all.


§ 6. From this Garden 
Kidron
 runs south-ward, and seems loth to

behold on his western bank the hill before 
Ierusalem
 whereon 
Solomon

befooled in his old age with his wives, built high places for 
Chemosh

and 
Molech,
 the Idols of 
Moab
 and 
Ammon;
 Could not Idolatry be con∣tent
to whisper in a hole, but she must hollow on a hill, and with a
brazen brow out face the Temple, yea in a manner challenge, and defie
it, to try which of them had the truest worship therein?
 
Thou shalt have
no other Gods before me,
 or, 
in my sight,
 is the first commandment. Now,
though all places are in the sight of an omniscient Deity, yet this Idola∣try
was done in the presence, of the presence of God, who more imme∣diately
and particularly is said to dwell in his Temple: Alass! what an
eye-fore were these high places to all the Godly in 
Ierusalem?
 It spoiled
the east and best prospect of all the windowes in the City, for none
could see the rising of the Sun, but withall must behold the rising of I∣dolatry.

Adrichomius
 tells us that the hill whereupon these Idols stood,
was commonly called the
 
Rock of offence,
 which name the Scripture
gives to our Saviour himself, but in different consideration: 
Christ
 was
a Rock of Gods laying; this of mans making: He a Rock of offence
unjustly taken at him by the wicked; this too justly given by it to the
godly.


§ 7. 
Kidron
 continueth his course south-ward by the 
Vale of Saveh,
 or

King Vale:
 haply so called from two
 Kings meeting of 
Abraham
 in this
place, namely 
Melchisedec,
 and the 
King of Sodome;
 the former with a
blessing, the latter with a request in his mouth: yea let 
Abraham
 at this
royall enterview pass for the third King, seeing it is more honourable to
make, then to be a King, who so freely here restored the subjects to the

King of Sodome.
 Many hundred years after in this vale 
Absalom
 then issue∣less
(as being before their birth, or rather after the untimely death of.


his children) erected a
 
Pillar
 to perpetuate his memory. Pilgrims at
this very day passing by the place use every man to cast a stone upon it:
and my request to the Reader is, if he should ever goe thither, that when
he hath first served himself, and satisfied his own revenge▪ he would then
be pleased to cast one stone more upon that heap, in my name, to ex∣press
my detestation of so damnable a Rebellion.


§ 8. Hence the River 
Kidron
 turneth his channell full east to finde out
his way to the dead sea,
 and leaveth at some distance on his northern
side 
the stone
 Zoheleth,
 whereon 
Adonijah,
 who advanced himself to the
kingdome, offered sacrifices, while the people cryed out, 
God save King
Adonijah;
 but this echo was quickly checkt and countermanded with a
lowder and greater, show
ed fourth from 
Mount Gihon, God save King
Solomon.
 Wonder not that this latter noise was heard hither, at six miles
distance, much befriended in the far and speedy conveyance thereof
with a hollow 
Vale of Iehosaphat,
 reverberated with 
Mount Olivet,
 and im∣proved
in the sound thereof by the advantage of the waters of 
Kidron;

besides it was mainly lowd in it self, so that (though much of Hyper∣bole
must be allowed in the expression) 
the earth
 rent with the sound of it;

worse was 
Adonijahs
 heart rent at the hearing thereof, who now exchan∣geth
his hopes of a Crown, for desire of Life, which he requested and
obtained by his submission to 
Solomon.
 So ended the short government
of 
Adonijah
 never sleeping in his reign, which began after the rising, and
ended before the setting of the Sun.


§ 9. Thus taking our farewell of 
Kidron
 in this Map,
 we pass over
the current thereof to 
Mount Olivet,
 on the eastern side, so famous in Scri∣pture,
consisting of three eminent Tops.



1 The most Northern, hereon the Cell of Saint 
Pelagia
 was built,
leading there a solitary life some hundred years after Christ: no
doubt a devout woman, especially if her heart was as holy as her
house was high.


2 The middlemost, from which Christ made his ascension to hea∣ven,
and after ages erected a fair Chappell in memoriall there∣of.


3 The most Southern, whereon the villages of 
Bethany
 and 
Beth∣phage,

the house of 
Simon the Leper,
 the grave of beloved 
Lazarus,

with the barren figtree which Christ cursed.



All three over-spread with Olive trees, (whence it hath its name) and
plenty of Palmes, of so quick growth, that those who 
cut down their

branches,
 when our Saviour on an Asses Colt (which with her Colt was
tyed hard by in the meeting of two ways) rode to 
Ierusalem,
 did no con∣siderable
trespass to the owners of those trees, so speedily they sprouted
again.


§ 10. Over the southern part of 
Mount Olivet David
 fled from 
Absalom,

for perceiving that his son by State-felony had stolne away his peoples


hearts, he politickly resolved not to be pent in 
Ierusalem
 (where the land∣flood
of a popular mutiny, might presently drown him) but to retire to
the uttermost bounds of his kingdome, mean time giving his subjects
leasure and liberty to review what they had done, dislike what they re∣viewed,
revoke what they disliked; that so on second debates they
might seriously undoe, what on first thoughts they had furiously at∣tempted:
knowing full well that Rebellion though running so at hand
is quickly tyred, as having rotten lungs, whilest well breathed Loyalty
is best at a long course. As 
David
 was flying this way, the Priests prof∣fered
their service to carry the
 
Arke
 along with them; Indeed how
could it well stay behinde, and what should the 
Arke
 and 
Absalom,
 Re∣ligion
and Rebellion do together? Was it not fit, that as once it was
joifully brought into 
Ierusalem
 with 
Davids
 dancing: so now it should
dolefully depart hence with 
Davids
 weeping? Howsoever he accepted
their good will, and on better
 reason declined their attendance. Com∣ing

 
a little past the top of the hill, Ziba meets him with a couple of Asses,
 loaden
with bread, Raisons, summer fruits and wine for the refection of 
David

and his company. But, ô the Bran in that Bread, rottenness in those
Raisons, dregs in that wine he brought, joining with them a false accu∣sation
of his Master 
Mephibosheth
 to be a Traitour; whilest, alass! all
the disloyalty that good man was guilty of, was onely his lame legs, his
lying servant; and his over credulous Soveraign 
David
 did rashly believe
this information.


§ 11. A little farther east-ward was 
Bahurim,
 where 
Shimei
 (Lord of
that place) cursed 
David,
 casting stones and dust at him. What meant the
mad man thus to raile being within the reach of 
Davids
 Armies, except
he intended to vent out his venome, and life together? But causeless
curses rebound on their Authors, and 
Ziba's
 gifts did 
David
 more harm
then 
Shimei's
 curses; for those betrayed him to an
 act of injustice,
whilest these improved his patience. Indeed his railing gave an Alarum
to the martiall spirit of 
Abishai,
 who
 desired a Commission 
to take off
the head of this dead dog
 (blood so let out in the neck vein is the soonest
and speediest cure of such a traiterous Phrensie.) But 
David
 who desired
not that 
Shimei
 should be killed for his words, but rather that his own
heart should be mortified by them, by heavenly Logick 
à majore ad minus,

argued his own soul into
 humility; that seeing his Son had conspired
against him, the ill words of an open Enemy ought patiently to be in∣dured.
Well! Let 
Shimei
 know though he pass unpaid for the present, yet
either 
David
 himself, or his Executors, Administrators or Assignes, shall
one day see this debt duly discharged.


§ 12. To this place of 
Bahurim Phaltiel
 the son of 
Laish
 followed 
Mi∣chal,

his (or rather 
Davids
) wife,
 weeping, when 
David
 demanded the
restitution of her, as unjustly detained from him. Wherefore all 
Phaltie

tears move no pity of mine; 
Caveat raptor,
 let him beware, who violently


takes another mans wife; seeing shame and sorrow are the issue of such
ungodly marriages. Here in a mans
 Court at 
Bahurim, Ionathan
 and

Ahimaaz Davids
 Intelligencers were concealed in this manner; an equi∣vocating
covering was spread on the ground, pretending nothing but
ground Corn laid upon it, but having under it the reservation of a dry
wel, into which the messengers were put, and by it a woman to manage
the fallacy with the less suspicion: she tells the pursuers after them

that they were gone over the river, which nigh 
Enrogell
 falls into

Kidron;
 ô that I could in the same instant commend her Loyalty, and
condemn her Lying; which being impossible, we must be contented,
successively first to praise her charity, and then to protest against her
falshood.


§ 13. Come we now to survey the south parts of 
the Land of Moriah,

where we meet some seven miles from 
Ierusalem
 with the famous City
of 
Bethlehem-Ephrath:
 The first mention of this Place we finde, was
when 
Iacob
 near to it buried his beloved wife
 
Rachel,
 dying in child-bed.
This was that 
Rachel
 who said in her
 fury, 
Give me children or else I
dye
 (as if she would have had them begotten, conceived, bred, and born
all in an instant) and now she had not onely her fill, but a surfet of her
own wish, had children and dyed. It seems, dying in child-bed her
corps required speedy interment: otherwise (no doubt) 
Iacob
 would
have conveyed them to the 
Cave of Macpelah
 the solemn sepulcher of his
family. She was buried by the high way, the ancient custome both of

Iews,
 and Heathen, partly to minde passengers of their mortality, and
partly to preserve the memory of the dead the longer, by so making their
monument the more publick and visible. Heathen used in like manner
to interre their dead in high-ways: yea their sepulchers served to measure
the distances of places.

 Hinc adeò media est nobis via: nam{que} sepulchrum


Incipit apparere Bianoris.—


Hence ev'n mid way it is for us: for near


Bianors Tomb beginneth to appear.

Nor is it amiss to observe that the self same place where 
Benjamin
 was
born, and his mother buried, fell afterwards to the lot of the
 
Benja∣mites,

as if 
Rachels
 body all the while had but kept possession for her
posterity.


§ 14. 
Bethlehem
 in Hebrew is 
the house of bread;
 principally so cal∣led
in reference to 
Christ,
 the bread of life, who in fulness of time was
here to be born: otherwise time was, when in this house of bread, little
bread was to be had, namely when God brake the staffe thereof in 
Israel,

by a
 ten years famine. This caused 
Elimelech
 with his wife 
Naomi
 and
her sons to remove into 
Moab,
 whence after ten years stay she returned
home to 
Bethlehem
 with 
Ruth
 her daughter-in-law, who here became an
extraordinary
 Gleaner on the field of 
Boaz.
 Here harvest being ended,

Ruth
 by the advice of 
Naomi,
 went afterwards to glean a husband for
her self, and came in the night to the
 threshing floor of 
Boaz,
 to chal∣lenge


in him the right of the next kinsman; some herein will censure her
carriage, to come at so unseasonable a time, to surprize a man for her hus∣band:
so that, 
se defendendo,
 to vindicate his credit, he must be forced to
marry her. But let these dainty dames, which condemn 
Ruth
 herein,
first follow her faithfulness in attending, then imitate her industry in
maintaining her mother-in-law, and this done, they will have less wan∣ton
thoughts in themselves, and more charitable opinions of 
Ruth.
 Be∣sides,
in the innocence and simplicity of those days, some passages might
be harmelesly performed, which in our age (grown ripe in wit, and
ri
e in wickedness) carry with them more then the appearances of evill.
She brought forth here 
Obed,
 the father of 
Iesse,
 and grandfather of

David.


§ 15. 
David
 afterwards was born,
 and keept sheep in 
Bethlehem

(therefore called the City of 
David
) here he made an experimentall syllo∣gisme,
and from most practicall propositions 
(Major
 a Lion, 
Minor
 a

 Beare) inferred the direct Conclusion, that God would give him
victory over 
Goliah.
 Hence he was fetched 
from following the Ewes big with
young,
 to goe before the people of 
Israel;
 and 
God
 intending to raise

David
 high in honourable old age, that the building might be the fir∣mer,
laid the foundation thereof very low in his laborious and religious
education. Being then better imployed, when thirsting after 
Gods
 ho∣nour,
then afterwards, when not far from this place, he fondly longed
for the
 
water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate,
 the 
Philistines
 Ar∣my
then encamping about it. But it shall not be said, that 
David
 desired,
what 
Davids
 subjects durst not perform; three of his Worthies boldly
marched through the midst of their enemies, quickly draw, safely beare
back, humbly present to their Soveraign this 
Aqua vitae,
 the procuring
whereof cost them the hazard of their lives. But though 
Davids
 fancy
was above his judgement in desiring, his conscience was above his
fancy in refusing to drink of that water,
 but 
powred it out unto the Lord.


§ 16. But that that gave the greatest lustre to 
Bethlehm,
 was that 
Iesus
Christ
 
the Prince of peace,
 was born herein of the blessed virgin 
Mary
 in a
time of peace, to procure and establish a peace betwixt God and
Man, Man and Angels, Man and Man, Man and his own Con∣science,
Man and other Creatures. Publick the place of his birth, an

 Inne, (every mans house for his money) and poor the manner
thereof, so defeating the 
Iews
 towring fancies of a 
emporall King,
who long looking to see their 
Messiah
 sitting on a throne, would
rather 
stumble
 at him, then 
stoop
 to behold him 
lying in a manger.

The first tydings of the 
Lambe of God,
 by intelligence of Angels,
is told to poor
 shepheards watching their flocks by night, whilest the
Priests the pretended shepheards of 
Israel,
 were snorting on their beds of
security. The place of this apparition not being far from the tower of

Eder
 (or, 
the tower of 
locks
) where
 
Iacob
 sometime pitched his tent,


and kept cattell, and where 
Reuben
 defiled his Fathers Concubine.


§ 17. And now the wise men of the East make speed to their Saviour,

directed unto him by a star, in its progressive motion probably point∣ing
at 
Iudea,
 as if it had been but the bare reflexion of a brighter star
which was there to be seen. These wise men, well read in the volume of
heaven, perceiving this to be no hypocrite star, or blazing Comet, (usually
portending not the Cradle but Coffin of some Prince) yea, no light con∣stantly
Leiger in the skies, conclude it an extraordinary Embassadour
sent upon some peculiar service, and advantaged with the Prophecy of

 
Baalam,
 current among the children of the East, haste to 
Ierusalem,

and put it to the question,
 
where the King of the Iews was to be born.
 Here

Gentile
 and 
Iew
 confer their notes, and compare their intelligence toge∣ther
concerning 
Christs
 birth; the former collecting the time from the
star; the latter concluding 
Bethlehem
 the place from the
 Scripture. How
much knowledge might men attain, if mutually they would lend their
light one to another! To 
Bethlehem Herod
 sends the wise men to seek this
new King, promising to come himself, and worship him, but secretly
similing at their diligent devotion, whilest 
God
 in heaven laughed at his
dissimulation.


§ 18. To 
Bethlehem
 they come to make enquiry after 
Christ,
 whom
none never sincerely sought, but they found him. The star by moving
(probably in the low region of the aire) shews them their way; by
standing still, the end of their journey: coming into the house they
finde the royall Babe, and present him with gifts; Then warned by

God
 in a dream, they return into their own Countrey another way. Say
not that they were more wise then honest, in not making good their
promise to goe back to 
Herod,
 seeing



1 No such promise made by them appears in Scripture, who be∣ing
certainly foreiners, and probably free Princes, owed no obe∣dience
to 
Herods
 injunction.


2 Had such promise been made by them, yet being done in consi∣deration
of another from 
Herod,
 to come and and worship 
Christ,

they were now remitted to their former liberty, his fraudulent
intent being revealed unto them by divine information.


3 Suppose their promise to return bound with an oath, yet herein
the breach thereof made no forfeiture, because their 
Recognisance

was taken in 
Gods
 name, who freely delivered up 
the band
 unto
them again.



Homewards they goe, whilest 
Herod
 wonders at their long delay, yet
comforts himself, that the slowness of their searching, will at last be re∣compensed
with their sureness of finding what he desired.


§ 19. Weary at last he is with waiting,
 seeing no 
King of the Iews
 was
found, and they lost, which were sent to seek him: But this old Fox
had two holes: fraud failing him, he betakes himself to force, and


sends executioners to kill all the children of 
two years old and under
 in 
Beth∣lehem,

and all the coasts thereof; 
Herods
 cruelty, being of greater com∣pass,
then the City of 
Bethlehem,
 took in that circuit which the walls
there of left out, so cunning he was to overdoe, rather then leave any thing
undone. Here no pen can express the mothers sorrows for their chil∣dren,
whilest one stood amazed, as if she had lost her son and senses
together: another bleeds out sorrow in her eyes, to prevent festering in
her heart: a third vents her passions in exclamations, and it gives her
some ease, though she could not recall her dead child, to call him Ty∣rant
that murdered it; All their mourning going severall ways, meet
in one common misery, whilest the soules of these children are charita∣bly
conceived by the Primitive Church all marched to heaven, as the

Infantry of the noble Army of Martyrs. Herod,
 the while, huggs himself, that
he had fitted their new King with a short reign, being confident, that
burning the 
Hive,
 he had killed the 
Master-Bee,
 though 
Christ
 was all the
while safe in 
Egypt,
 where his Policy could not finde, whence his power
could not fetch him.


§ 20. 
Bethlehem
 is on all sides compassed with places of eminent note.
On the North stood 
Ramah,
 nigh which was the execution of those in∣fants.

In Ramah was a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning,

 Rachel weeping for her children &c.
 Some will say 
Leah
 had more cause of
sorrow (to make her eyes watry
 by nature, worse with her tears) 
Beth∣lehem

belonging to the Tribe of 
Iudah▪
 But let such know, that the cruel∣ty
of 
Herod
 extended to all the coasts of 
Bethlehem,
 and so also reached to

Benjamin,
 in whose confines 
Bethlehem
 was situated. Besides it is the opi∣nion
of some learned men, that the land about 
Bethlehem
 was called 
Ra∣chel,

from her sepulcher so eminent in these parts. 
Zelzah
 is hard by (in
Hebrew 
a place shadowed,
 and therefore we have presumed to cover it
with trees) where 
Saul
 according to 
Samuels
 prediction first heard ty∣dings,
that his Father had found his Asses, and feared the loss of his Son,
who had found a kingdome.


§ 21. South-ward we finde 
Asahels
 sepulcher
 
buried in the grave of his
Father:
 and south-west-ward in the way to 
Hebron, Geruth-Chimham,

the Manor or Mansion of 
Chimham,
 son of 
Ba
illa
,
 no doubt bestow∣ed
on him by 
David
 according to his Princely promise,
 to give him

whatsoever he should choose
 or 
require.
 Many years after, 
Iohanan
 the Son of

Kareah
 with the remnant of the poor 
Iews,
 which had escaped the 
Baby
lonish

captivity, dwelt at 
Geruth-Chimham
 untill contrary to Gods express
command, hence they departed into 
Egypt.
 Almost full west lay 
Bezek,

whose King 
Adonibezek
 was punished according to his own cruelty, who
having 
cut off the Thumbs and Toes of threescore
 
and ten Kings,
 caused them
to 
gather their meat under
 his table.
 Now if 
Isaac's
 question to 
Iacob
 con∣cerning
his kid, was of consequence, 
how he came so quickly by it?
 The
Quere here is more considerable, how came 
Adonibezek
 by so many


Kings, to have them all at one time? With what Royall drag-net did he
fish to catch so many together? Where got he these Kings? and where
got they their kingdomes? 
Canaan
 being so small a Countrey. In an∣swer
hereunto, in the acception of the word King, we must grind the
honour thereof the smaller, to make the number thereof the greater,
communicating it to the Sons and Nephews of Toparchicall Princes,
as honours in 
Germany
 equally descended to all in the family, and so the
number is quickly made up.


§ 22. North of 
Bethlehem
 lay the 
Vale of Ephraim,
 or 
Vale of Giants,

men of vast proportions, which the ancient Ages plentifully afforded.
Yea, our English Antiquary
 tells us, that 
Risingham
 a village in 
Nor∣thumberland

in old Saxon, is nothing else then the dwelling place of
Giants. In this 
vale of Rephaim,
 the 
Philistines
 (little less then Giants)
were twice subdued; once at
 
Baal-perazim,
 where God by the hand of

David brake forth upon them as the breach of waters:
 and again, where 
God
 not
onely gave the success, but laid the design how the battell should be ma∣naged,
namely as soon as he himself had sounded a charge out of the

 Mulberry trees, 
David
 was to fetch a compass, and fiercely to fall on
his enemies. Well is 
God
 styled 
a man of war,
 who here ordered the
battell himself, and well did 
David
 confess 
Thou teachest my hands to war, and
fingers to fight,
 who here received from 
God
 particular instructions, how
to regulate his Army.


§ 23. Mulberry Trees (pardon a digression) were plentifull in 
Pa∣lestine;

A tree which may pass for the emblem of prudence, slow in
consultation, swift in execution; for it putteth forth its leaves the last of
all trees, but then (as it is said) all in one night, as if sensible of, and
ashamed for its former neglect, she endevours to overtake other trees
with her double diligence. Men feed on the fruit, Silkworms on the
leaves thereof: Creatures contemptible in themselves, admirable in
their qualities, appearing 
Proteus
-like in sundry shapes in the same year,
eggs, wormes, flies, finishing for the most part yearly their life and work
together. But we leave these mysteries to be discussed by Naturalists,
and will onely adde, that if the originall of silke were well considered,
Gallants had small cause to be proud of gay clothes, for from wormes
it came, and to wormes shall the wearers therof return.


§ 24. Store of the best silks were made and used in 
Palestine;
 amongst
other favours bestowed by 
God
 on the ungratefull 
Iews,
 this was one. 
I
have girded thee about with fine linen, and covered thee with
 
silk.
 King 
Saul
 was
the first, who made bravery frequent, and fashionable in 
Israel
 (little
state and gallantry being used under the 
Iudges
) when the Court and
costly clothes began together, according to our Saviours
 saying, 
They
that weare soft clothing are in Kings houses:
 I say in the reign of King 
Saul,

rich rayment began generally to be worn by the 
Iews:
 
Yee daughters of
Israel weep over Saul, who clothed you in Scarlet and other delights:
 yea by the


confession of the heathen writers, best silks both for fineness and colour
were in 
Palestine.
 
Pausani
s
 writes 


. 
The silk
 (saith he) 
of Elis
in Greece gives not place in point of fineness to silk of the Hebrews, but is not like it
in yellowness:
 whereby it appears, that the 
Hebrew
 silk-wormes were as
good spinsters, and better Dyers then those in 
Greece,
 setting a better
gloss and lustre on their work. So much for the silk in 
Iudea
 called

Shesh
 in Hebrew, whence haply, that fine linen or silk is called 
Shashes

worn at this day about the heads of eastern people.


§ 25. But to return to our description,
 north-west from the 
vale of
Giants
 lay the City of 
Emaus,
 afterwards called 
Nicopolis.
 Hither the two
Disciples were a travelling, being about sixty furlongs from 
Ierusalem,

whē 
Christ
 after his resurrection unknown joined himself to their cōpany.
They tax him for not knowing the news in 
Ier
salem,
 he reproves them for
being ignorant of the sense of the Scriptures, which he began to declare
unto them. O excellent expositor! Christ Commenting on his own
prophecies, all which he first inspired, afterwards fulfilled, and now in∣terpreted.
As he put light into their heads; so also heat into their hearts,
which
 
burned
 all the while he communed with them: onely 
their eyes
were held that they knew him not.
 Day, and their journey drew both to an
end, when Christ makes 
as if he would goe
 
farther;
 Truth cannot lye,
but did simulate, onely to try how welcome his company was to
them. They constrain him to stay, (such civill violences prevaile on hea∣ven
it self) and 
in breaking
 
of Bread,
 he brake himself unto them: their
eyes being opened, he left them full of joy and amazement. Nor have I
ought else to observe of 
Emaus
 but that many years before, 
Iudas Macca∣
eus

in that place got an eminent conquest, and defeated the voluminous
Army
 of 
Lysias.


§ 26. Hard by 
Emaus
 even at this day are showen the ruines of 
Za∣chariah

his house,
 where 
Iohn
 the Baptist was born, being the 
voice of a


cryer,
 begot of a dumb Father. This was that 
Zachariah
 who would not
beleeve 
God
 without giving him a sign, and was punished that men could
not understand him, without making of signes. To this place (then in a
City in the Hill-country of 
Iudea
) the blessed virgin 
Mary
 came with
hast to congratulate the pregnancy of 
Elizabeth
 her Cousen; at the musick
of whose salutation, the babe danced for 
oy, and 
leaped in
 
the womb of
Elizabeth.


§ 27. Hard by is the City 
Gebah
 belonging to the
 Priests;

afterwards made a
 garrison of the 
Philistines,
 who therein were smote
by 
Ionathan.
 King 
Asa
 afterwards built, that is, repaired and enlarged
this City, as also 
Mizpah,
 with the remainder of those materials, which
King 
Baasha
 had provided for the fortifying of 
Ramah:
 Cities so neer in
situation, that after the captivity, their inhabitants are counted together
in one
 sum, 
the men of Ramah and Gebah six hundred twenty and one,
 which re∣turned
from 
Babylon.


§ 28. We have hardly recovered into this map,
 the house of 
Obed-Edom,

whence 
David
 in a most solemn procession brought the Ark to

Ierusalem,
 dancing himself before it in a linen 
Ephod,
 which was not so
white, but that 
Michal
 found spots therein, or rather cast dirt thereon,
censuring 
David
 a fool for his indiscretion. But, when holy zeal is ar∣raigned
at the bar of profaneness, and condemned either for 
folly,
 or


madness,
 it may appeal from that sentence, and challenge its right to be
tried by its 
Peers;
 carnall eyes being incompetent judges of spirituall
actions. Yea, 
God
 himself here took the matter in hand, so ordering it,
that for the future, 
Michal's
 daughter should never mock her husband on
the like occasion, punishing her with perpetuall barrenness.


§ 29. Look on the prospect of this map,
 especially the eastern parts
thereof, and behold it overspread with trees of all sorts, 
Olive, Pine, Mul∣berry,
Firre &c.
 Of the last saith the Psalmist,
 
and the fir-trees are a refuge
for the Storkes,
 breeding here in the greater abundance, because forbidden
by the
 Leviticall law to be fed upon. A speckled bird (therefore

 in Greek from 
 niger, & 
 
albus,
 black and white) and
is remarkable for their love to their parents, feeding them in their old
age. Hence called 
Chesida
 in Hebrew, that is, 
the mercifull bird;
 and in
Dutch 
Oudevaer,
 that is, 
the carrier of the old one,
 because every Stork is
an 
Aeneas
 bearing his 
Anchises
 on his back, carrying his Parent, when for
age it cannot fly of it self. Some have confidently reported, that Storks
will not live, save in a Republick; who may with as much truth af∣firm,
that an Eagle, the Soveraign of birds, will not breed in a Common∣wealth.
Not to say, that Storks were named in the Monarchy of 
Adam,

preserved in the Arke in the Monarchy of 
Noah. Ieremy,
 who lived in the
kingdome of 
Iudah,
 upbraided the ignorance of the people therein, 
Yea
the
 
Stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times.
 Which birds had they

known their times,
 and the 
Iews not known the birds,
 as frequent, and fa∣miliar
with them, both the Prophets illustration had beed obscure,
and exprobration improper for his present purpose.


Finis Libri secundi.














To the Right Honourable
JOHN
LORD ROSSE,
Son to the Right Honourable
JOHN
EARL OF RVTLAND.


MY LORD,


I
T hath been charged by Foreiners on
our English Gentry, that many of them
very knowing beyond the seas, have
been strangers in their native Countrey;
as able to give a better account of the

Spaw,
 then our own 
Bath;
 the diving
of the 
Spanish Anas
 under ground, then of our own Rivers

(Diverill
 in 
Wiltshire,
 and 
Mole
 in 
Surrey
) wherein the
same wonders of Nature are set forth in a lesser Edition.


How just this accusation is, for the present I have no lea∣sure


to enquire, but am afraid, that too many of our nation are
guilty of a greater Ignorance; That being 
quic
 sighted
 in
other kingdomes, and Countreys, they are altogether 
blinde

as touching 
Judea,
 and the land of 
Palestine;
 the 
Home
 for
their meditations, who are conversant in all the historicall
passages of Scripture.


Yet I would not have any wilfully to expose themselves (as
Saint 
Paul
 was against his will) to
 
perils of waters, perils
of Robbers, perils by the Heathen, &c.
 personally to pace and
trace the land of 
Canaan:
 who rather conceive that precept
to 
Abraham▪
 
Arise, walk through the land in the breadth
thereof, and in the length thereof,
 may be performed by us,
even whilest we also follow the counsell of 
Joash
 to 
Amaziah,
Abide
 
now at home.


This may be done by daily and diligent perusing of the
Scriptures; and comparing the same with it self; (Dia∣monds
onely cut Diamonds) as also by consulting with such as
have written the description of that Countrey. Amongst whom
give me leave (though the unworthiest of thousands)
to tender these my endevours, to your Honours seri∣ous
perusall, and patronage, hoping my pains herein may con∣duce
to the better understanding of the History of the Bible.


I confess the doctrinall part of the Scripture is in it self most
instructive to salvation. But as the rare relation of the wo∣man
of 
Samaria,
 first drew her neighbours to the sight of our
Saviour, which afterwards believed on him, not for her words,
but his own worth; so the delightfull stories in the 
Bible
 have
allured many (youth especially) to the reading thereof, the

light
 (the historicall part) first inviting their eyes, whose
hearts were afterwards inflamed with the 
heat,
 the 
holy fire

in the doctrine of Gods word.



Give me leave therefore my Lord, humbly to commend to
your Honour, the constant reading of that, which eminently
is termed 
The Scripture
 and the 
Bible
 or 
Book,
 all other be∣ing
but 
scribling
 and 
Pamphlets
 in comparison thereof. They
contain what will make you 
wise unto salvation;
 and the
study thereof will render your Lordship more truely honoura∣ble
then your outward extraction.


Great indeed was the priviledge of 
Ruth,
 for whom purposely
some handfuls were
 let fall, for her to gather up. But greater the
honour done to your Ancestors by our English Kings, above
an hundred years since, who scattered some 
flowers
 (and other
ornaments) out of their own 
Armes,
 therewith to deck and
adorn those of your 
family.


Yet know my Lord that the 
Bereans
 are
 pronounced

more noble
 then those of 
Thessalonica, in that they re∣ceived
the word with all readiness of minde, searching the
Scriptures daily, whether those things were so:
 And
by the same proportion your exact skill industriously attained
in Gods word, shall make your soul increase 
with the
increase
 
of God;
 far more honourable then that 
Aug∣mentation

in 
Heraldry,
 which was conferred on your An∣cestours.


Remember I pray what 
David
 writes, 
I
 
have seen an
end of all perfection, but thy commandement is exceed∣ing
broad.
 Oh imperfect perfection which hath an end! And
indeed 
David
 lived in an Age, wherein he saw 
Goliah
 
the
strongest
 overcome, 
Asahel the
 
swiftest
 overtaken, 
Achi∣tophel


the wisest
 befooled, and 
Absalom the
 
fairest
 defor∣med
with a violent death. Yet still the 
immortall word
 out∣lived
all casualties, and triumphed in defiance of opposition.



Wherefore as the 
Jews
 were to provide a chest by the side
of the Ark wherein the Law
 was to be placed and kept, so I
wish your Honour a 
large heart
 to be a repository for this

Broad commandement
 of God, that therein you may care∣fully
lay up and treasure the same, which when all earthly per∣fections
prove false and fading, will furnish your soul with ho∣liness
here and happiness hereafter: which is the daily prayer
of


Your Honours
most humble servant
THO. FULLER.






Here followeth the description of 
Jerusalem.


















THE
DESCRIPTION OF
THE CITY OF
IERVSALEM. The third Book.




CHAP. I. Of the severall names and generall situation of Jerusalem.


§ 1 
W
Hen a woman often altereth her surname, it is a
signe she hath been many times married; deno∣minating
of his wife from him, being parcell of
the
 
maritall priviledge.
 But when a City in diverse
Ages hath different names, this speaks her succes∣sive
subjection to severall 
Lords,
 new 
owners
 impo∣sing
on her new appellations, as in our present subject plainly appears.
For the City which we are to describe was called



1
 
Salem,
 in the days of 
Abraham,
 when 
Melchisedec
 was King, and
probably first founder thereof. Then it was but a small place,
(the greatest 
Giant
 had once the cradle of his infancy) when
mount 
Moriah
 (afterwards in the midst of the City, and 
a forest
of houses
) was as yet but 
a thicket of
 
thornes,
 wherein the 
Ram,

the exchange for 
Isaac,
 was caught by the hornes.


2 
Iebus.
 A name either of the whole or principall part thereof; so
we read of the 
Levite
 that he 
came over against Iebus, which is Ie∣rusalem.


3 
Ierusalem
; so called, as the Fathers generally affirme, as the pro∣duct
of the union of 
Iebus
 and 
Salem, B,
 for 
sounds sake
 being


changed into 
R,
 which notwithstanding the propriety of the

Hebrew tongue
 will not permit. For though chopping of letters be
her cōmon practise, yet, the 
Iews
 (as they always married within
their own Tribe, so they) exchanged letters of the same Linage,
(same 
Instrument) Labials
 for 
Labials, Gutturals
 for 
Gutturals,
 whereas
betwixt 
Beth,
 & 
Resh
 in Hebrew no such affinity. Besides the turn∣ing
of a tender melting 
B.
 into a surly rigid 
R.
 is not to levigate
or mollifie, but to make the name the harder in pronun∣ciation.
This drives others to seek out the Etymology thereof,
as signifying in Hebrew, 
The vision of peace.
 But seeing 
Abra∣ham

called an eminent place whereon it stood, 
Iehovah-Iireh,
The Lord will be seen;
 perchance from the echo of the name 
Iireh

added to 
Salem,
(that is, 
peace shall be seen
 or 
provided
) the City
might be called 
Ierusalem,
 where having the essentiall Consonant
,
the most various point-vowels are not so considerable. Forget
we not that even in 
Davids
 time, when the name of 
Ierusalem
 was
in fashion, the City was sometimes still called 
Salem: For in
 
Sa∣lem
is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling in Sion.
 Thus it is usuall in

England
 in common discourse to cut off the former part of long-named
Cities, 
Wes
chester, Southhampton, Kingstone on Hull,
 whilest
the remnant 
Chester, Hampton, Hull
 sufficiently express them to
ordinary capacities.


4 
Hierosolyma,
 which indeed is no new name, but the old name in
a new language, translated into 
Greek.
 Some
 Fathers will have
it compounded from the 
Greek
 word 
 a 
Temple
 and 
 
So∣lomon,

that is, 
Solomons Temple,
 as if the mixing of these Languages
did promise, if not prophesie, in after ages a joint interest of 
Iew

and 
Gentile
 in the mysteries of Religion. But Saint
 
Hierome
 is
zealous against this Fancy, impatient that in the name of the prin∣cipall
City of the 
Iews
 a Greek word should not onely be min∣gled
with, but preferred before the Hebrew. It is safer therefore
to say, that 
Hierosolyma
 is nothing else but 
Ierusalem
 grecized, or
made Greek, and the conceit of the Temple of 
Solomon
 rather a
witty allusion thereto, then a solid deduction thereof.


5 
Solyma,
 being onely the half of the former. For whereas 
Hieroso∣lyma

being a confluence of six short syllables was unmanagable in
ordinary verse, Poets served this name (as the 
Ammonites
 the cloaths
of 
Davids
 Ambassadours) cut it off in the middle.

An
 Solymum cinerem Palmeta{que} capta subibis?


Wilt thou go under Salems dust forsaken,


Vnder the palme-trees lately captive taken?

I conceive the name of 
Solyma
 not used by Authors till after our
Saviours suffering, though 
Iosephus
 (and probably out of him

Tacitus
) writes that 
Homer
 makes mention thereof, as indeed
we finde it
 twice in his Poems, never for this City in 
Iudea,
 but


for a place and people in 
Lycia.
 I will not say that the curtling of

Ierusalem
 into 
Solyma
 after our Saviours time, was a sad pro∣gnostick
that this spacious City should suddenly in the fire of ci∣vill
war be boiled away to the half, yea afterwards shrink to so
unconsiderable a smalness that a monosyllable, yea a bare letter
were too long a name for it.


6 
Aelia,
 so named from 
Aelius H
drianus
 the Emperour, who built
some part of it again, and made it a Garrison.


7 
Ierusalem,
 recovering the ancient name again, whilest for some
hundred of years it was in the possession of the 
Christians.


8
 
Cuds,
 so called at this day by the 
Mahometans,
 who are the present
owners thereof, which signifies 
Holy
 in their language.



Here we omit those many appellations given 
Ierusalem
 in Scripture: 
The


 
faithfull City, the City of the great
 
King, the
 
holy City,
 because these are
not proper names, but glorious Epithets thereof.


§ 2. Concerning the generall situation of 
Ierusalem,
 three things here∣in
are remarkable: first it was placed, as
 
Iosephus
 reports, in the very mid∣dle
of 
Iudea.
 But herein criticall exactness is not to be observed, (the
heart it self is not so unpartially in the midst of the body, but that if not
in position, yet in motion it propends to the left side) for 
Ierusalem
 in∣clines
more to the south of the Countrey. As 
Ierusalem
 was the navell of

Iudea,
 so the Fathers make 
Iudea
 the middest of the world, whereunto
they bring (not to say, bow) those places of Scripture, 
Thou hast wrought
salvation in the midst of the earth.
 Indeed seeing the whole world is a 
round
Table,
 and the Gospell the 
food
 for mens souls, it was fitting that this

great dish
 should be set in the midst of the 
Board
 that all the guests round
about might equally reach unto it; and 
Ierusalem
 was the 
Center
 whence the

lines of salvation
 went out into all lands. Yea 
Ptolemy
 dividing the (then-known)
world into seven Climats, placed 
Ierusalem
 as the 
Sun,
 in the fourth
Climat, proportionably to what is said in the
 Prophe
, 
I have set it in the
midst of the Nations, and the Countreys that are round about her.


§ 3. Secondly, it had high
 mountains under it, and lower about it,
which as dutifull servants at distance seemed to attend it. 
Ierusalem
 had
a mountain for her footstool, and her floor was higher then the roof of
other Cities: no doubt the Emblem of the strength, stateliness, and
stability of Gods Church in glory. High and hard climbing thither, but
plain and pleasant dwelling there.


§ 4. Lastly, it was distanced from the sea welnigh forty miles, ha∣ving
no navigable River near unto it. For God intended not 
Ierusalem

for a staple of trade, but for a 
ROYALL EXCHANGE OF RE∣LIGION,

chiefly holding correspondency with Heaven it self, daily re∣ceiving
blessings thence, duly returning praises thither. Besides, God would
not have his virgin people the 
Iews,
 wooed with, much less wedded to
outlandish fashions. And if
 
Eusebius
 may be credited, for the self same


reason, 
Plato
 in imitation of 
Ierusalem,
 would have that City, wherein the
modell of his imaginary 
Common-wealth
 should be set up, to be seated
some miles from the sea, lest forein merchandize should by degrees
bring in forein manners into it.






CHAP. II. The particular Situation, Circuit; Populousness, Beauty and strength thereof.


§ 1 IT will be pain-worthy to enquire into the exact situation of 
Ie∣rusalem

in what Tribe it was placed, the rather because severall
testimonies of Scripture entitle both 
Iudah
 and 
Benjamin
 unto the posses∣sion
thereof.


For IUDAH. 
Josh. 15. 63.
 
And for the Iebusites, the inhabitants of
Ierusalem, the children of Iudah could not
drive them out, but the Iebusites dwell with
the children of Iudah at Ierusalem unto this
day.
Judg. 1. 8.
 
Now the children of Iudah had
fought against Ierusalem, and had ta∣ken
it, and smitten it with the edge
of the sword, and set the City on
fire.


For BENIAMIN. 
Josh. 18. 28.
 
And Zelah, Eleph, and Iebus,
(which is Ierusalem) Gibeah and
Kiriath. This is the inheritance of
the children of Benjamin according to
their families.
Judg. 1. 12.
 
And the children of Benjamin did
not drive out the Iebusites that inhabited
Ierusalem, but the Iebusites dwell with
the children of Benjamin in Ierusalem
unto this day.


FOR BOTH: 
Nehem. 11. 4.
 
And at Ierusalem dwelt certain of the children of Iudah, and of
the children of Benjamin.

This fifth and last place is a good Comment on the four former, name∣ly,
that this City (though the 
Iebusites
 long disturbed their quiet posses∣sion)
jointly belonged to both Tribes, neither claiming it totally as 
his,

both truly as 
theirs;
 Nor
 was this any confused mixture of their inhe∣tances
(flatly forbidden in the law) but methodicall (if not mysticall)
meeting thereof, so that 
Iudah
 and 
Benjamin
 (which alone persisted loyall
to God and their King) had their possessions lovingly shaking hands
in 
Ierusalem,
 the solemn place appointed for Gods publick service.


§ 2. 
Ierusalem
 was fifty
 furlongs in circuit, which reduced to our
English account amounts to six miles and a quarter. In which compass
multitudes of People did inhabit, and three different degrees of the po∣pulousness
of this place are very remarkable.



1 Ordinary, even in 
vacation-time,
 when there was no 
spring-tyde,



or usuall confluence of people more then the proper Citizens
thereof, and those no fewer then one hundred and fifty
 thou∣sand.


2 Extraordinary, at the three annuall 
Termes,
 (as I may call them)
I mean the three Feasts general of the 
Iews,
 Passeover, Pentecost, the
feast of Tabernacles, when all the able males
 of 
Israel
 appeared
with an offering before God.


3 Superextraordinary, when this City was sacked by the 
Romans,

and when all sorts, and sexes (some drawn with devotion,
more driven for protection) flocked thither, insomuch that by
fire, famine, sword, civill discord, and forein force, eleven
hundred
 thousand are said to be slain therein.



Incredible it seems that so many should be pent in this place, except the
people therein (as when they crouded about Christ, 
 


) did 
throng
 and 
press
 one on another. But we must consider
that flying thither for shelter, they had room enough, if they had but
room enough, not aiming at any convenient, (much less delightfull ha∣bitations,)
but onely a bare lodging in 
Ierusalem,
 where for the time being,
every single 
chamber
 was made a severall 
family,
 and every 
story
 multi∣plyed
into a 
street
 whilest the fiege continued.


§ 3. And therefore it is most justly recounted asone of the 
ten wonders

(whereof the 
Rabbins
 take especiall notice amongst the 
Iews
) that

ver
 
any man did say to his fellow, I have not found a bed in Ierusalem to lye in; nor
did ev
r any ma
 say to his fellow, My lodging is too strait for me in Ierusalem.
 As if

he place were of a 
Cheverell
 nature, to extend to the proportion of the
People therein. Indeed it was part of Gods goodness when he brought

his Vine out of Egypt,
 then also 
to prepare
 
room for it,
 which he performed
here accordingly, even to admiration.


§ 4. Now amongst the nativ
s of 
Ierusalem,
 many no doubt were the
eminent Persons born therein, especially, if the Rabbinicall tradition be
true, that 
wheresoever the particular place of any Prophets birth is not set down, there
it is to be presumed that he was of Ierusalem.
 By this observation, 
Nathan, Gad,
Isaiah, Daniel, Hosea, Ioel, Habakkuk, &c.
 should be town-born children
of 
Ierusalem.
 But we leave it uncertain whether this place gave the cradles
to these, being too sure that it gave the coffins to too many worthy messen∣gers
of God, 
O Ierusalem,
 
Ierusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest
them that are sent unto thee.


§ 5. The structure of this City was beautifull and high, of hewed free∣stone,
very uniform, whether in respect of the houses, or streets, one toano∣ther:


Ierusalem 
 builded as a City which is at unity in it self.
 Their roofs were flat

nd fenced with battlements, by speciall
 command from God▪ to pre∣v
nt
casualties of people falling thence. These roofs were the 
Iews
 watch∣
owers
for prospect, galleries for pleasure and (which was the worst)
their 
igh places
 for Idolatry. Which causeth the Prophets complaint


more then
 once, 
That thereon they burnt incense unto all the host of Heaven.

Surely the weight of this wickedness did break the strongest beams, and
stiffest rafters in the Palaces of 
Ierusalem.
 For, though 
Idols be lighter then
vanity it self,
 in point of power, and efficacy; they are heavier then lead
to press the place down with divine vengeance.


§ 6. As for the strength of 
Ierusalem,
 we must in the first place listen
to 
Iu
ah
 his song,
 
We have a strong City, salvation will God appoint for walls and
bulwarks.
 The 
Spaniards
 come off poorly with their brag, that they have

Madrid
 a City in 
Castile
 walled with
 fire; which at last proves nothing else
but that there be many quarries of flint found round about it. But, most
true it is that God promised 
Ierusalem,
 he would 
be unto her a wall of fire
round about:
 which promise he for his part, would most surely have kept,
and performed, had not the sins of the 
Iews
 forced him to break it, in
vindication of his own justice.


§ 7. As for the outward fortifications thereof, it was incompassed
with a
 treble wall, save where it was begirt with unpassable vallies,
and there one wall did suffice. This wall was fenced with a ditch, cut
out of a rock, saith
 
Iosephus,
 and
 
Strabo,
 sixty foot deep, and two hun∣dred
and fifty foot broad; the former not acquainting us with the au∣thour
thereof, so prodigious a work may well be conceived, a perfor∣mance
of many successive Princes therein. It seems, it was made the
deeper because it was dry:
 
, 
well
watered within, and dry without,
 is the character our author gives of the Ci∣ty.
This I dare say, the breadth of this ditch exceeds the proportion of
al modern regular fortifications, for in 
Breda
 it self (the platform where∣in,
may be the platform for other places) the 
ditch
 is no broader then
the 
rampire
 at the bottome thereof. And now, what
 
David
 principally
intended mystically, comes to our place literally to endevour, 
Walke a∣bout
Sion, and goe round about her: tell the towers thereof. Mark yee well her bul∣works,
consider her palaces, that yee may tell it to the generation following.
 And to
follow the motion of the Sun, we will begin at the East, and so for∣ward.






CHAP. III. Of the Gates thereof.


§ 1. BE it premised,
 that many difficulties in this subject have been
caused by mens unwary confounding of the severall natures of
the gates in 
Ierusalem,
 which for the clearing of the truth, must carefully
be distinguished into four sorts, in sundry places serving for different em∣ployments.


Gates



1 In the 
out-wall,
 giving ing
ess and egress to passengers, the sole
subject of our present discourse.


2 In the 
in-walls,
 (like 
Temple-bar
 opening out of 
Fleet-street
 into
the 
Strand
) being partitions within 
Ierusalem.
 Such the 
Iron∣gate

through which
 Saint 
Peter
 went out of prison, to the
house of 
Mary
 the mother of 
Iohn Mark.


3 
Leading to the Courts of the Temple:
 (as Saint 
Austins-gate
 into
Saint 
Pauls
 Church-yard) such the
 
beautifull gate &c.


4 
Of the Kings palace:
 (like 
Bulwark- gate,
 and 
Iron-gate
 leading to

London tower
) as the gate
 whereby the 
horses came into the Kings
house.



Now such as promiscuously make all these to be out-gates of 
Ierusalem

ingage themselves in difficulties, and deceiv
 others thereby. For preven∣tion
whereof we will onely insist on the gates of the first qualification.


§ 2. Begin we with the 
Sheep-gate
 on the east of 
Ierusalem,
 in
 
Nehemi∣ahs

time owing the reparation thereof to 
Eli
shib
 the high Priest, and his
brethren. Through this gate the sheep were driven in, and all other cat∣tell
designed for sacrifice, as the nearest way to the Temple.


§ 3. Next followeth the 
Golden-gate
 (not mentioned in Scripture,

but mee
ly depending on
 humane authority,) so called because gilt all
over, vulgar beholders (who carry no touchstones in their eyes) ac∣counting
all massie gold which is richly gilded. Popish
 authours adde
that when our Saviour in an humble but solemn equipage rode on an
Asse colt to the Temple, this gate opened unto him of its own accord: a
prety proportionable fiction. For, if the
 
Iron-gate
 opened to 
Peter
 a Di∣sciple,
no less then a 
Golden-gate
 could offer entrance to Christ his Master.
Onely here's the difference, we receive the one as recorded in Scripture,
and re
u
e the other as not reported therein, especially our Saviour ha∣ving

o fair an occasion to make mention thereof. For when the Pha∣risees
questioned him for not silencing the Childrens 
Hosa
a
s,
 and
when he returned, th
t 
if they
 
should hold their peace, the stones would immedi∣ately

ry out,
 how easie had it been for him to adde, that 
the very walls of the
City had already opened their mouthes
 (their gates) 
to receiv
 him?


§ 4. Thirdly,
 the 
Horse-gate
 by the Kings palace, through which the
grooms brought the Kings hor
s, to water them in the brook of 
Kidron,

yet some erroneously make this the same with the 
Water-gate.
 The Pro∣phet
points at the exact position thereof 
towards
 
the east,
 and we finde
the mention, but not the reedifying of this gate in
 
Nehemiah;
 a Presum∣p
ion,
that it was not so ruinous as the rest, and not needing much repa∣ration.
As for 
,
 who cryed 
Treason, Treason, (the fox the finder
)
when she was the greatest Traitour herself: on the
 Comparing of
Scripture it will appear that the 
Horse-gate
 whereat she was killed, was
not this City gate, but another so named leading from the Temple to the
the Kings Palace▪



§ 5. Fourthly,
 the 
Water-gate,
 In a fall, or declivity of ground,
 
full
east.
 So called, because thereat▪ all the 
ewers, channels, and water-courses
of the City, flowed out, and ran into the brook 
Cedron▪
 No mention in

Nehemiah
 of the repairing hereof, for the reason aforesaid. Indeed, if
in his time the 
Iews
 had 
de no vo,
 from the very ground begun the building
of the walls, and gates thereof, it had been impossible, they could have
finished that work
 
in two and fifty days.
 Whereby it appears, they onely
mended those places, which were most in dilapidation. This was the 
East∣gate,

emphatically so called
 by the Prophet, and opened into the valley
of the 
children of Hinnom.


§ 6. Thus far the gates on the east of 
Ierusalem.
 On the south thereof▪

where 
Sion
 (or 
the City of David
) lay, we meet with no gates at all, the
precipice of the rock affording no passable ascent on that side, so that
men must goe first through 
Ierusalem,
 and then into 
Sion.
 I dare not say
that herein 
Ierusalem
 was a type of the 
Militant,
 as 
Sion
 (more mounted)
of the 
Triumphant
 Church, although there be no access for those which

are without
 into the happiness of the latter, but by taking the holiness of
the former in their passage thereunto.


§ 7. Come we now to the west, in the southermost part whereof, we
light on the 
Fountain-gate,
 near the pool of 
Shiloah
 whence it took its
 name,
nigh to which on the inside, were those
 stately staires, whereby men
went up to the 
City of David.
 This gate was in 
Nehemiahs
 time repaired
by
 
Shallum
 the Son of 
Col-hozeh.


§ 8. Next to this the 
Dung-gate.
 A gate in greatness, though but a
postern for the private use thereof, through which the offall, and excre∣ments
of the City were conveyed. Appliable to this place, is that which
the
 Apostle speaketh, of some parts of the body▪ 
Nay, much more thos

members of the body, which seem to be feeble, are necessary.
 This gate, though of
small honour, was of great use, and all 
Ierusalem
 had been a 
Dung-City▪

but for the 
Dung-gate.
 Yea, the noisomer soile carried out hereat, and
conveyed hence into the gardens thereabouts, was by natures Chymistry
converted into wholesome herbs, and fragrant flowers growing there.
The 
Dung-gate
 in the days of 
Nehemiah,
 was set up, with the doors, locks,
and bars thereof, by
 
Malchiah
 the son of 
Rechab.


§ 9. Next follows the 
Valley-gate,
 commonly but wrongfully placed
on the east side of the City; chiefly on this account, because the 
valley
 of

Kidron
 lyeth on that side thereof. As if this valley alone was near 
Ierusa
¦lem,

which by the Psalmist is described
 
with the mountains round about it,

and so by necessary consequence must be surrounded with vallies inter∣posed
betwixt it and those mountains▪ This gate stood in the north-west▪
opening into the 
valley of Carcases,
 lying betwixt it, and 
Mount Calvary.

Here 
Nehemiah
 began,
 and ended his surveying the ruins of the walls▪
going by night, because loth to be seen, and loth to see so sad a sight. This
valley-gate was in his time repaired by
 
Hanun and the inhabitants of Za∣noah.



§ 10. Having thus surveyed the east,
 south and west, come we now
to the northern part of the City. Where, first, we finde the 
Corner-gate,

whose angular position speaks it to participate of two points, being seated
in the very flexure of the wall from the east to the north. It was distanced
from the gate of 
Ephraim
 just four hundred cubits, all which space of the
wall was broken down by 
Ioash
 King of 
Israel
 when he conquered

Amaziah,
 that his Army might march in triumphantly with the greater
state. Pride we see hath not onely an high neck, but also a broad breast
(especially when setting her armes by her side) so large a passage must be
cleared for her entrance. Afterwards King 
Uzziah
 rebuided this gate,
and adorned it with towers, yea fortified 
all the
 
turning of the wall.
 For,
as the elbows of garments ought to be made the strongest, as most sub∣ject
to wearing out: so (walls being the cloaths of Cities, without
which they are naked) wise 
Uzziah
 adjudged it necessary, that this 
Cor∣ner-gate,

and wall bending thereabout, should have most cost and care ex∣pended
in the fortification thereof,


§ 11. No mention of the repairing of this gate in 
Nehemiah,
 which
prompteth us with these conjectures:



1 Either that it was then dammed up. 
Ierusalem
 after the captivity
being large in extent, and thin in people, (many uninhabited
places being left therein) probably in policy they contracted
the number of their gates, the multiplying whereof did require
more money and men to guard them. Or
 rather,


2 Being so lately built by 
Uzziah,
 it might notneed much mending,
as left standing, and undemolished by the 
Babylonians.



For, in the sacking of a City it often fareth with the gates as with the
men thereof, it is hard if some doe not escape, and survive the destructi∣on.
Yea, sometimes conquerours are pleased to spare some parcell of
walls, out of pity (not to the place but) to themselves, finding the
structure thereof of so firme constitution, that it requires more pains
then it will return profit in the levelling thereof.


§ 12. Next comes the gate of 
Ephraim.
 so called, not because standing
in, but opening towards the Tribe of 
Ephraim.
 I deny not, but that
some 
Ephraimites,
 after their return from captivity, dwelt in
 
Ierusalem,

from whose habitations hard by, this gate might, in probability, bor∣row
his name; but prefer the former notation as most naturall. For
usuall it is, both for streets and gates, to take their denomination from
such places (though at great distance) to which they lead. Witness 
Ken∣tish-street

in
 
South-wark,
 for that it is the way (saith my authour) 
leading
into that County,
 the street it self otherwise being in 
Surrey:
 and witness

Winchester-gate
 in 
Sarisbury,
 so named, because through it travellers pass to

Winchester,
 a City twenty miles off: and (an instance best known to
Scholars) 
Trumpington-street
 in 
Cambridge,
 so called from a village some
two miles thence. This gate was probably destroyed, when 
Ioash
 King


of 
Israel
 entring 
Ierusalem,
 brake down four hundred cubits of the wall,

from the gate of Ephraim, to the Co
er-gate,
 where I conceive, the particle

from
 is to be taken inclusively (so that both the gates were cast into that
account) the rather, because 
Pride,
 and 
Cruelty,
 always, when they make

measure,
 give in 
the advantage.


§ 13. Next the 
Old-gate:
 so called (as 
Bonsrerius
 will have it) because
extant here, ever since 
Melchisedec
 was the founder thereof. If so, it was
an 
Old-old-gate
 indeed. But, as men having out lived all Registers, ac∣count
themselves; so gates having outlasted all memories, are account∣ed
by others, more ancient then truely they are. However, no wonder,
if in 
Nehemiahs
 time the decays of so old a fabrick, called to the charity
of
 
Iehoiada
 the son of 
Paseah,
 and 
Meshullam
 the son of 
Besodajah
 jointly to
repair them.


§ 14. Next the 
Fish-gate.
 By mistake generally placed in the west
wal, meerly because 
Ioppa
 on the Mediterranean sea, whence they fancy all
fish (
as if no moe ways to the water, then one
) must come to 
Ierusalem,
 lay on
the west thereof. Whereas in Scripture we finde no express of fish for
mans eating (but one which eat a man, 
Ionab
 his Whale) mentioned
from thatplace, whilst whole sholes were caught in the 
Sea
 of 
Galilee,
 or 
lake

of 
Tiberias,
 lying north of 
Ierusalem▪
 Indeed 
Tyre,
 lying almost full north
from this City, was the staple place, which furnished it with fish (as
appears in
 
Nehemiah
) which through this gate was brought to 
Ierusalem.

Surely, the provisions of any populous place in long time will tire, if
onely going on feet, or flying on wings, and not also swimming
with fins, having fish as well as flesh and fowl for their repast,
as here in 
Ierusalem.
 And although no sacrifices of fish were by
God appointed to be offered unto him, yet hence the less wholesome∣ness,
or cleanness of them cannot justly be inferred; because they were
improper for offerings, living in an element wherein men had no con∣versation.
This gate was
 repaired by the sons of 
Hassenaah.


§ 15. The 
gate of Benjamin
 doth onely remain,
 he the least in his fathers
family, this the last amongst the gates of 
Ierusalem,
 standing in the north.
east part thereof. Indeed we finde two gates of 
Benjamin
 in 
Ierusalem
 (two
of the same name, in one City, no wonder, the double 
New-gate
 in 
Lon∣don,

the later new made postern into 
Moor-fields
 may be an instance there∣of)
one called the 
high-gate
 of 
Benjamin,
 where 
Pashur
 put the
 Prophet

Ieremy
 in the stocks, 
which was by the house of the Lord,
 and therefore proba∣bly
a gate of the Temple. The other was an out-gate of the City leading
into the land of 
Benjamin,
 whither 
Ieremy
 was going to separate himself,
when the Captain of the
 guard in this gate, seised him in his passage,
falsly accused him, and occasioned his imprisonment.


§ 16. Here I cannot but wonder at many
 learned men,
 who make
this 
Gate of Benjamin,
 to be the same with the 
Corner-gate.
 I deny not but
that in many Cities it is usuall, for one and the same gate to have severall


names, as I have learnt from my industrious, and judicious
 friend in
his description of 
Canterbury,
 how 
Burgate,
 and Saint 
Michaels-gate
 are
the same▪ and so 
Newin-gate,
 and Saint 
Georges-gate
 in that ancient City▪ But
the fancy of the foresaid authors, is directly oppossite to the words of the

Prophet, foretelling that 
Ierusalem
 should be inhabited 
from Benjamin gate,
unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner-gate, &c.
 where we may behold these
two gates, 
Benjamin,
 and the 
Corner-gate,
 set at terms at great distance, and a
considerable space interposed. This gate was not repaired in 
Nehemiahs

time for the reasons formerly alledged.


§ 17. These are all the gates of 
Ierusalem,
 whereof express mention in
Scripture. Some fancy another, called the 
Needles-eye,
 so low, and little
onely men might enter thereat. These conceive our Saviours expression,

 
It is easier for a Camel to goe through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man
[
 
tru∣sting
in his riches] to enter into the kingdome of God,
 intended this small postern;
where, the 
bunch
 on the 
Camels back,
 was the 
Porter
 to shut it against him,
for entering in thereat. But, we listen hereunto, as to a fable, and account
the 
threading of
 
Saint Wilfrides needle,
 as a conceit (though much later and
of a different nature) to have as much gravity, and truth therein.






CHAP. IV. Of the Towers on or about Ierusalem.


§ 1. BEsides these gates,
 
Ierusalem
 was beautified▪ and fortified with
many towers proportionably interplaced, though we finde but
few of them recorded by name. Amongst these we meet with the tower
of
 
Meah,
 that is, 
the hundred tower,
 so called either because so many cubits
high, or so many distanced from some other tower, or because a just 
Cen∣tury

of towers was at it begun or finished. It was built after the capti∣vity
by 
Eliashib
 and his brethren the Priests.


§ 2. The 
Tower of furnaces,
 standing in the West, north of the 
Valley gate,

jointly repaired by
 
Malchiah,
 and 
Hashub.
 So called (thinks 
Adrichomius
)
from fire kept there as a signall to seafaring men; But oh woefull those
Mariners, who in a dark night had no better direction then what they
received thence, above forty miles from the sea, and many mountains
interposed! rather it might serve for some Beacon, or land-mark, or
might take its name from some fire in the 
corpse du gard
 constantly preser∣ved
therein.


§ 3. 
The tower of Hananeel
 in the east part.
 So called, no doubt, from
the first builder thereof. It was in 
Nehemiahs
 time repaired by 
Eliashib

the
 high Priest, and his brethren.


§ 4. The 
Tower
 
that lyeth out from the Kings high house,
 nigh unto which

Palal
 the son of 
Uzai,
 repaired in 
Nehemiahs
 time. Not that the promi∣nency
of this extravagant Tower, hindred the uniformity of the walls,


but the fencing of the City, required such situation thereof.


§ 5. The 
Great
 
tower that lyeth out,
 different from the former, else the
builders of the wall in 
Nehemiahs
 time, made no progress in the work;
in the east of the City, over against which the 
Tekoites
 did repair.


§ 6. The 
Tower of
 
David,
 furnished with an armory, at the south∣west
turning of the wall, over against which 
Ezer
 the son of 
Ioshua
 re∣paired.
Christ compareth the neck of his
 spouse to this Tower for the
whiteness and proportionable length thereof.


§ 7. But among all these,
 most remarkable was the Tower of 
Siloe

(near unto the water of 
Siloe
 whence it fetcht its name) on the west
side of the City, which killed
 eighteen men with the fall thereof. Yet,
the stones of this tower fell not more heavy on their bodies, then the
censure of uncharitable 
Iews
 did on their memories, condemning them
for the greatest sinners in all 
Ierusalem,
 as whose offences were mounted
so high, that nothing less or lower then the fall of a tower, could depress
their Persons, and impieties to the pit of perdition. False position to
maintain, that those have wrought the most sin, who are brought to
most shame, and confuted by our Saviour, assuring the 
Iews,
 if they did
not repent, 
they should likewise perish: likewise; certitudine, non similitudine poenae.

Yea, in a mysticall meaning, those incredulous 
Iews
 who rejected our
Saviour, did not onely 
fall on a stone,
 and so 
were broken,
 but also 
the stone fell

on them, by reason of their infidelity, and
 
ground them to powder.


§ 8. We will conclude with the 
Tower of Ophel,
 so named from 
dark∣ness,

as some would have it, because always cloudy and misty at the high
top thereof: But though the Etymology of 
Ophel
 be obscure, the situation
and use thereof is clear in Scripture, over against the
 
Water-gate,
 where
the 
Nethinims
 had their habitation. Understand not all of them at once,
but so many of their society, as for the time being, were in ordinary at∣tendance
about the Temple, whilest the rest lived in other
 Cities assign∣ed
unto them.


§ 9. These 
Nethinims
 were descended from those 
Gibeonites,
 who for
their fallacy put on 
Ioshua,
 and the people of 
Israel,
 were condemned to
the drudgery of Gods service.
 Thus the fathers lying tongues, cost their
children many aking armes, and weary backs, with 
hewing of wood,
 and

drawing of water. Saul
 was a great
 persecutour, 
David
 a grand preserver
of them, who first made them a 
Corporation:
 He and his Princes appoin∣ting
them for the service of the 
Levites,
 when first we finde them called

Nethinims,
 (to bury the odious name of 
Gibeonites
) that is, persons 
given
 to
to pious uses. These for many generations approving their industry in
Gods service, washed out the 
staines
 of their Fathers falshood, with the

sweat
 of their fidelity: and in proces of time, (though 
Hivites
 by extra∣ction)
attained to some honour above the natives of 
Israel.
 For whereas
the sons of 
Barzillai
 were put by their places in the
 Priesthood, because
they could not clear their pedegree; the 
Nethinims
 continued in their


place whose
 genealogies were exactly, derived▪ Yea, whereas other

Israelites
 were subject to heavy taxes, after their captivity, the 
Nethinims

were exempted from all tribute (pity their purses and persons should
both bear burdens) by the bounty of the Kings of 
Persia.
 Whose liberality,
though a Pagan, to Gods worship (
like the precious ointment on
 
A
rons head
which ran down to his beard, even to the skirts of his garment
) flowed from the

Priests
 and 
Levites,
 by the 
singers,
 and 
porters,
 to the 
Net
inims
 (the very
verge, and utmost hem of Temple officers) by his especiall grace taking

 order, that it should not be lawfull to 
impose toll, tribute, or custome upon
them.


§ 10. Many moe towers not mentioned in Scripture,
 were about

Ierusalem,
 as the
 
Tower of women,
 remarkabl
 in 
Iosephus.
 But, why i

was so called (what have women to doe with war?) I will give him a
satisfactory answer, who first resolves me, why the 
Roman
 Fortification
of twelve acres of ground
 neer 
Dorchester,
 is called 
Maidens-castle.
 But,
we refer all the towers of 
Iosephus
 his reporting (not appearing in Scri∣pture)
to our particular Map of 
Ierusalem,
 as by him described. Come
we now to make some observations on such as were the builders of the
City walls, in the days of 
Nehemiah,
 because it was built on the same
Area or floor with that in 
Solomons
 time, and we meet with many remar∣kables
in the history thereof.






CHAP. V. Observations on the repairers of the walls of Jerusalem, in the
days of Nehemiah.


§ 1. MInisters ought to 
leade the Van,
 and be the first, and forwardest
in all pious projects. Behold here 
Eliashib
 the high Priest,
with the Priests his brethren, begin the work, and built the
Sheep-gate. A gate ministeriall unto the Temple, (through which the
sheep were brought intended for sacrifices) and therefore, as it was fit
it should have the preheminence to be first repaired: so the Priests were
the most proper persons to be imployed therein. Of this gate it is solely,
and singularly said, that they
 
sanctified it,
 which dedication speaks it
set apart to holy service as introductory of the 
offerings
 into 
the house of
God.


§ 2. Great is the influence of the Pastours example,
 on the
peoples practise. 
Many hands make light work,
 behold a troop of buil∣ders
cometh,

of all



Professions, private persons, publick officers, whole families
of all jointly, 
Levites,
 Merchants, Gold-smiths, Apothecaries &c.


of all Places, from 
Iericho, Tekoa, Gibeon, Mizpah, Zanoah &c.


Sexes, both men and women. 
Next repaired Shallion the son of
Halloesh, the ruler of the half of Ierusalem, he,
 
and his daughters.




What, had their tender hands any skill to carve stones, or weak shoulders
any strength to carry morter? Or, was it sutable with the modesty of
their sex, to clime ladders, clamber scaffolds, seeing there is no acting
for any builders, but upon such stages? Surely they refused no pains pro∣portionable
with decency to their power; and what was wanting in
their persons, supplied with their purse, expending it (perchanc
) out
of their own portions. And, if orphans money put into the 
Chamber of
London,
 be accounted so sure; God (no doubt) did repay, what they
laid out on the 
walls of Ierusalem.


§ 3. Now whereas 
Shallum
 their Father is styled 
ruler of the half part of
Ierusalem,
 rather subtile then solid is the note of 
Tremellius
 thereupon.
For, saith he, 
Ierusalem
 being in two Tribes (
Iudah
 and 
Benjamin
) had
therefore two rulers thereof. Not considering, how in the same Chapter,
other smaller Cities, and those undoubtedly whole and entire in one
Tribe, had notwithstanding two governours over them, and those be∣nefactours
to the building of 
Ierusalem;

As



Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of
 part of Beth-haccarem.


Shallum the son of Col-hozeh,
 the ruler of part of Mizpah.


Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the
 half part of Beth-zur.


Hashabiah, the ruler of the half
 part of Keilah.


Banai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the
 half part of Keilah.



Now the dividing of the command of the City betwixt two Gover∣nours,
so usuall at this very time, and no
 notably extant in Scripture, be∣fore,
or after the days of 
Neh
miah,
 leads us to this probable opinion,
that immediately upon the 
Iews
 return from 
Babylon,
 the 
Persian
 Empe∣rour
(from whom all Commissions were derived) would not entrust
any 
Iew
 with the sole rule of a strong City, but for the better security,
parted it betwixt two, who had joint, but distinct dominion therein:
That whilst they with mutuall jealousie observed the actions each of
other, both might preserve the interest of their Master.


§ 4. In building the Old gate two co-founders were joined together,

namely,



1 Iehoiada the son of
 Paseah.


2 Meshullam the son of Besodaiah.



I will not say that as 
York
 Minster was built by 
Percy
 and 
Vavasour,
 the
one giving stone, the other timber to that structure: so the building of this
gate was in like manner advanced betwixt them; but hence observe, that
it is no shame for one to admit a partner in that weighty work, which
he caunot weild by himself. Blame worthy their pride, or peevishness,


who will not have that good design done at all, which can not all be
done by themselves.


§ 5. Whereas 
Malchiah
 the son of 
Rechah
 is recorded builder of the
Dung-gate (no needless port in that City,
 seeing in populous places, Per∣fumers
may be spared with less loss to the publick, then Scavangers)
some
 conceive this 
Malchiah
 to have been a 
Rechabite
 by descent, and a
ceremonious observer of their Ancestours instructions, 
not to drink
 
wine,
nor build house, but to live in tents,
 with other Canonicall obediences. Nor
was this building of the wall of 
Ierusalem
 any breach of their vow;
partly; because a publick, no private edifice; and partly, because those
their ceremonious observances, probably terminated at the 
Babylonish

captivity. This 
Malchiah
 they make heir of the family of the 
Rech
bites,

according to the Propheticall promise, that one of that house
 
should not
fail to stand before God for ever.
 But, whether herein Interpreters doe not
take more then the text tenders unto them, be it reported to others.


§ 6. It is signally observed,
 that 
Hanun
 the
 sixth son of 
Zalaph,
 re∣paired
a piece of the wall. But, where were his five elder brethren? Were
they dead, or absent, or idle, or impotent? The Scripture giveth no ac∣count
of them, onely the sixth son is recorded for his forwardness here∣in.
In matters of piety, there is no standing on useless (yea on dange∣rous)
modesty. No breach of good manners, to goe before our betters
in goodness, or for the younger brother in nature, to gain the birth-right
in grace.


§ 7. It is said of 
Baruch the son of Zabbai
 verse 20.
 (and of him alone it
is said) that he 
earnestly
 
repaired the other piece.
 What, did the others work
but in jest, because this Accent 
earnestly,
 is onely put over the piece he re∣paired?
Is not this mark of honour on him, a brand of infamy on the
rest? No surely, though probably his zeal was paramount in the em∣ployment;
and what if the word 
earnestly▪
 (set there almost in the very
midst, amongst all the builders) be to be taken 
, relating to all the
rest, before, and behind it?


§ 8. It is observed,
 that many men repaired onely 
against their own


 
houses.
 This, though at the first sight it may seem the fruit but of a nar∣row
soul, and private spirit, yet effectually advanced the work. Yea, it
is particularly recorded of 
Meshullam
 the son of 
Berechiah,
 who likely
was but a lodger, and no house-keeper, that he repaired over
 
against his
Chamber.
 Oh, if order were observed for every one to mend his own
heart, or house, how would personall amendment by degrees quickly
produce family-city-countrey-kingdome-reformation? How soon are
those streets made clean, where every one sweeps against his own
door?


§ 9. Some doubled their files,
 as 
Merimoth the son of Urijah the son of Coz,

who having formerly been a repairer (verse 4.) comes again the second
time to build (verse 21.) out of doubt the same person, as having the


same name, father, and grand-father. Let him have double praise, for
his double pains; who not being weary of well doing, dealt with the
wall of 
Ierusalem,
 as the 
Philippians
 with Saint 
Paul,
 
once and again relieving
the necessity thereof.


§ 10. The nobles of 
Tekoah
 are taxed 
for not putting their necks to the work


 
of their Lord.
 Strange that now they should discover such unseasonable
pride. Had they not lately returned from 
Babylon?
 Could not seventy
years banishment from their own, and captivity in a forein land, hum∣ble
them to purpose? Me thinks, so long suffering should have broken
(though not their hearts) their stomacks. But, oh the difference be∣twixt
being 
low,
 and being 
lowly!
 No affictions, except seasoned, and
sanctified, are sufficient to bring down mens naturall corruption. This
negligence of the 
Tekoite nobility in Gods cause
 was so much the more con∣spicuous,
because of the double diligence of the 
Tekoite commoners
 there∣in;
for, they had two shares in this adventure, building, 
Nehem. 3. v. 5.

and again they had verse 27. another bout in the same service. Except any
will say, that by the 
Tekoites
 in the second mention of them, their nobility
are intended; who, sensible of their own dishonour, for their former
backwardness, played an after-game, to repair their credit; which is af∣firmed
without any proof, and with little probability.


§ 11. Some here will demand,
 What did 
Nehemiah
 himselfe all the
while? did he onely look on, work with his eyes, and command others
to labour? Or was he like the 
Scribes
 and 
Pharisees, who bind heavy bur∣thens,
and grievous to be born, and lay them on mens shoulders, but they themselves
will not move them with one of their fingers?


§ 12. It is answered,
 his zeal was active, and exemplary in Gods
work, and therein expressed it self,



1 Privatively, in forbearing the salary of the Governour, which
his predecessours did, and he might justly receive. In this re∣spect,
one may truly say, that each gate, tower, and piece of wall
in 
Ierusalem,
 was in part repaired with 
Nehemiah's
 money, because
the builders thereof were the better enabled for that work, by
his remitting unto them, the taxe due to him as Governour.


2 Positively, not onely forbearing his own right, but also bearing
a large proportion in the work. He kept a daily Ordinary (thanks
being the onely shot his guests were to pay) for an hundred and
fifty 
Iews,
 and Rulers, besides strangers of the Heathen. How
many attendants then dined on the reversion, at the waiters ta∣ble?
and how many poor feasted on the fragments, at the Por∣ters
lodge? It may be presumed many laborers at the wall had
gone supperless to bed, had they not repaired to 
Nehemiah's
 house
for their refection.



As for the opinion of 
Tremellius,
 that 
Nehemiah
 built the Kings palace at his
own charge, grounding the same on his own translation of the text,


because I finde no other Authours to follow him therein, it is enough
barely to mention his opinion.


§ 13. At the Sheep-gate they began to repaire,
 and thereat also they
ended. The Gold-smiths and Merchants brought up the Rere of the
work,
 
betwixt the going up of the corner unto the sheep-gate.


§ 14. Within the circumference of the walls, lay much ground un∣inhabited,

people being loth to live therein, except
 
by lot
 compelled
thereunto, and all
 
blessed
 such as 
willingly offered themselves to dwell therein.

Strange, that the chiefe City should run so low in generall reputation,
the Gallants of our age being otherwise minded, all posting unto the
principall place of the kingdome, as the fountain of fashions, and all
delights. I read indeed of 
Histria
 a province under the 
Venetian
 Com∣mon-wealth,
that they are fain to
 hire people to inhabit there. But the
reason thereof is visible, because of the unwholsomeness of the aire,
whereas no such pretence for any to decline the City of 
Ierusalem,
 whose
elevated situation, conduced much to the purity, and wholsomeness
thereof.


§ 15. But mens unwillingness to dwell therein,
 took the rise from
other reasons▪ as namely,



1 The common enemy beheld it with most envious eyes, as the
proper object of his malice.


2 The vast circuit of the City, put them to hard duty to guard it.


3 Trading was dead therein, and little wealth to be gotten at the
new erection thereof.


4 All coveted the countrey, for the privacy, pleasure, and profit there∣of.



However in after ages, 
Ierusalem
 grew exceeding populous, and had all
the vacuities thereof filled, yea crowded with inhabitants. Thus, as it is
most easie and thrifty, to make childrens garments too big for their bo∣dies,
because they will quickly grow up to their clothes: so providence
advised 
Nehemiah,
 to make the circumference of Infant-
Ierusalem
 the
larger, as which, in process of time, would soon spread it self, to the re∣plenishing
thereof.






CHAP. VI. Of the waters in and about the City.


§ 1. PAss we now from the walls, to the water of 
Ierusalem,
 a most
necessary commodity for the well being of mankind. True it
is, 
Ierusalem
 was so far from boasting of any navigable river, that it had
no stream, near, or about it, to drive any water-mils. If it be demanded,
how without such mils so populous a place could subsist, and not be
famished for want of grinders? (as a chap-fallen man for lack of use of


his teeth) Know this was principally supplyed by hand-mils, here or∣dinarily
used, where multitudes of slaves were in every family. As for
other waters, both for necessity, and pleasure, 
Ie
salem
 had, (though no
super
tuity) a self suffi
i
ncy thereof.


§ 2. The waters,
 in and about 
Ierusalem,
 are reducible unto three se∣veral
kinds.



1 Partly artificiall, as 
Pools
 and 
Conduits.


2 Partly naturall, as the 
brook Kidron
 (whereof
 formerly) and 
the
fountain of Si
am.


3 Partly supernaturall, as the miracle-working 
Pool of Bethesda.



Of the former sort were the 
Kings fishponds,
 on the south-west, not far
from the fountain ga
, and near thereunto 
the pool
 
which was made,
 (no
doubt with gre
 care and cost) betwixt 
the sepulchers of David
 and 
house
of the mighty men.
 Also the 
conduit of the
 
upper or old pool, in the path 
o the
fullers field,
 and probably another of the 
lower pool,
 all referred by learned
m
n
 to 
Solomon,
 as principall Author thereof.


§ 3. For in the 
Inventory of his vanities
 he confesseth of himself; 
I made me
pools of water to 
a
r th
re
ith the wood that bringeth forth
 
trees.
 Thus he sought
for 
felicity
 in the aire, climbing up with his lofty buildings; in the earth,
di
ing low in his deep minigs; in the water, wading therein through
costly 
aquaducts;
 but found at last that happiness w
s 
super-elementall,
 and
not to be found but in heaven.


§ 4. Some may conceive that King 
Uzziah
 had a hand in promoting
the 
water-fabricks
 near 
Ierusalem,
 finding him a very 
active Engineer,
 and of
whom it is expresly recorded that 
he digged
 
many well
▪
 But what fol∣loweth?

for he had much cattell both in the low Countrey, and in the plain.
 The

scene
 therefore of his 
watry discoveries,
 was laid at greater distance, where
his cattell were kept, and where he was more commendably imployed
in his 
husbandry,
 then afterwards in 
Gods house,
 any instrument better be∣fitting
his hand, then a
 
Censer.


§ 5. Not long after, probably in the reign of King 
Ahaz,
 (as may
partly be collected from the time of 
Isaiah's Prophecy,
 and pla
ing of this
passage therein) when the siege of 
Ierusalem
 was suspected from 
Rezin

King of 
Syria
 and 
Pekah
 King of 
Israel,
 the 
Iews
 fell to the fortifying of
their City, both with wall and water-works. Hereupon the
 Prophet
when the 
new line
 about 
Ierusalem
 was finished, complaineth thereof as
followeth. 
Yee have seen also the breaches of the City of David, that they are ma∣ny,
and yee have gathered together the waters of the lower pool: And yee have
numbered the houses in Ierusalem, and the houses yee have broken down to fortifie the
wall. Yee made also a ditch betwixt the two walls for the water of the old pool, but yee
have not looked unto the maker thereof, n
ither had respect unto him that fashioned it
long agoe. And in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping and mour∣ning
&c.


§ 6. Not that the Prophet herein reproved the people,
 for provident


preventing of danger, or politick endevou
ing of safety, or moderate
delighting in pleasure, but justly taxed them,
for



1 Too much confidence in the arme of flesh.


2 Unseasonable rejoycing in carnall comforts, when drains and
for ditches 
down their own cheeks,
 had been more proper 
water-works

for the present sad occasion.


3 Admiring their own handy-works, (without thankful relating
for to God the principall) as if they had created those pools and
springs of their own industry and ingenuity.



Whereas all 
Grottoe
, conduits,
 and 
Aquaducts,
 though allowed the lawfull

issue
 of art, and 
off-spring
 of humane invention, are but 
sti
born babes
 at the
best, except God quicken and enliven them, mediately or immedately,
with moisture from above. He onely is the 
Father
 
of the rain,
 and is by
consequ
nce the 
Gra
d-father of all pools
 and 
conduits
 whatsoever. Justly
therefore were the 
Iews
 reproved, for having their 
steg
atick Souls,
 dab∣ling
too much in water, without once looking up to God, according to

Davids div
ty,
 freely confessing,
 
All my fresh springs are even in thee.


§ 7. But how well soever,
 the ponds, pools and conduits were per∣fected
at this time, soon after all their curiosities were discomposed,
when 
Se
heri
 sent the railing message and letter, (though words
whether spoken, or written, storme no Cities) to King 
H
zekiah
 in 
Ie∣rusalem.

Who fearing a siege, by the assistance of his Princes and people
in a short time stopt 
all the
 
fountains and the brook which ran through the midst
of the land, saying, Why should the Kings of Assyria come and finde much water? He∣zekiah

knew that 
S
nnacheribs
 blasphemous tongue would be sooner si∣lenced,
and his roaring throat easier stopt, with 
Thirst
 then with any
other answer. And although 
Sennacherib,
 out of the plentifull 
Magazeen

of his malice, 
shot his arrows, even bitter
 
ords,
 
gainst 
Hezekiah,
 yet ac∣cording
to Gods promise he came not into 
I
usalem,
 nor did
 
he sho
t an
arrow there,
 having all his Army soon after confounded from heaven, and
he himself, (reprieved from the 
Angels
) was executed by his own Sons
sword, in his own Countrey.


§ 8. Here if any demand,
 what is meant 
by stopping the brook which ran
through the midst of the Land;
 we understand not 
Cedron
 thereby, which to
save them the pains in summer stops it self, (as onely the cistern to re∣ceive
the land-flouds from mount 
Olivet
) but rather, conceive the con∣stant
waters of 
Gihon,
 or 
Siloam,
 therein intended, running through the
midst of the 
Land of
 
Moriah,
 wherein 
Ierusalem
 is seated.


§ 9. After 
Sennacheribs
 departure,
 
Hezekiah
 fell a fresh on opening those
springs hee had formerly obstructed, yea to make them reparation, he
improved them to an higher perfection then at first he found in them: for,



1 He made 
a pool
 
and a conduit.


2 
He
 stopped up the upper
 water-course of Gihon, and brought it straight to
the west side of the City of David.



3 
He
 brought water IN TO THE CITY
 of Ierusalem.



Hereby no doubt 
Hezekiah
 got many a blessing and hearty prayer from
the poor servants in the City, whose weary shoulders had formerly
fetched their water so far off for the use of their masters family.


§ 10. Here some will object,
 that such an altering of the 
course
 of this
river, from the ancient 
channel
 thereof, and the enticing of it by Art into a
new 
passage,
 was a violence, and a trespass offered to Nature. Yea did not

man
 herein pretend to more wisdome then his 
maker,
 as if by such 
varia∣tion,

he could direct the 
veines
 in the 
body of the earth,
 to a fitter posture, then
that wherein God himself had disposed them▪ But let such know, that
when God 
gave the earth
 [with the water therein, as making up one
Globe] 
to the Sons of men,
 in the same charter he derived a right unto them,
to mold it as might be most convenient and advantageous for their habi∣tation.
And although it belongs to God alone, to put a 
sandy girdle
 about
the loins of the Ocean, (because otherwise a giant too great for men to
manage) 
Hither shalt thou come, and no farther,
 yet lesser brooks fall un∣der
the jurisdiction of humane industry, to order them for mans most
commodity.


§ 11. Others will admire,
 that this 
new river
 was brought no sooner
to 
Ierusalem,
 and that a project, so honourable, profitable, necessary, and
feasable lay so long unperformed. How came this design to escape the
searching eyes of 
Solomon,
 especially, seeing (as he confesseth himself) he
dealt much in that moist
 
Element?
 See we here, 
Solomon himself saw not all
things,
 and 
Hezekiah
 coming many years after him, might supply his
omissions. And to speak plainly, many of 
Solomons
 projects, were but

voluptuous essays
 for his own personall (not to say carnall) contentment,
whereas holy 
Hezekiah
 in his undertakings might have a more 
publick
spirit
 for the generall good of his kingdome.


§ 12. The 
well
 or 
fountain
 of the 
Dragon
 near the 
Valley gate
 might be
made at the same time,
 probably taking its denomination from some
artificiall resemblance of a Dragon about it. A conduit in a 
Dragon-fa∣shion,

(though such 
Anticks
 are more commonly presented 
spitting of fire

then 
venting of water
) is made here by 
Adrichomius. Tremellius
 con∣ceiveth
it called 
Dragon,
 or 
Serpent well,
 because the waters thereof
(which contrary to other Authors he maketh the same with 
Siloam
) glide,

snake-like,
 soft and gentle, yea crooked and winding with many intri∣cate
flexures thereof. But it is impossible to assign the certain cause of
such names as are meerly 
ad placitum,
 finding a 
Well
 and 
Gate
 in the 
Cose

of the City of
 
Sarisbury
 of the same name, yet hitherto could never hear
any probable reason thereof.


§ 13. Amongst the waters meerly 
naturall,
 the 
fountain
 or 
pool of
 
Siloah,

with the stream flowing thence into the brook of 
Kidron,
 justly claimeth
the preheminence. Fountain which both in the name and nature there∣of,
was the lively embleme, if not the reeall type of our Saviour. Name



which is by interpretation,
 
SENT;
 and we know, 
When
 
the fulness of time
was come, God SENT forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law.

Nature; for the waters thereof, as the
 Prophet observed, ran
softly


1 To the eye▪ 
sine im∣petu,

moving slow∣ly,
and not rushing
with a rapid stream
like an impetuous
torrent.


2 To the eare, 
sine
strepitu,
 stil & quiet,
not offensive to the
neighbours with
the noise threof.


 So Christ 


1 Was leasurable and treatable
in his 
going
 (on foot, but if
mounted, onely on a slow
paced Ass) and 
doing,
 not rash∣ly
precipitate in his procee∣dings.


2 Not querulous or clamorous
in his discourse; 
He shall not
strive nor cry
 
neither shall any
hear his voice in the streets;
 but
meek and quiet.



Now as God was eminently in the 
still
 
voice,
 so also was he effectually
once in this 
still water,
 when our Saviour sent the blind-born man hither

to wash, and thereby he recovered his sight.


§ 14. This was he,
 who afterwards proved so constant a confessor of
Christ, avouching him a Prophet, and his cure by him really effected
notwithstanding the Pharisees menacing to the contray; Hoping in
vain, though Christ had opened his eyes, that they could stop his mouth,
from the acknowledging thereof. His constancy herein cost him an ex∣communication
and a 
casting
 
out
 of the Synagogue. The best was, the

power of the Keys
 when abused, doth not 
shut the door of Heaven,
 but in such
cases onely 
shoot the bolt besides the lock,
 not debarring the innocent person
entrance thereat.


§ 15. The supernaturall 
pool of Bethesda
 by the
 
Sheep-market
 remains,

whose waters, when 
at a certain season moved
 by an Angel, were medicinall
to cure the first commer thereinto, 
whatso
ver disease he had.
 A learned

man conceiveth, that when 
Eliashib
 the high 
Priest,
 (after their return
from 
Babylon
) with his brethren, first began hereabouts to build the

sheep-gate,
 and 
sanctifie it
 to divine service, (as leading to the Temple)
God then and there in approbation of his Act, indued the 
Pool
 hard by,
with this soveraign sanative quality: but this we leave with the Author.


§ 16. By this Pool an 
Infirmary
 was built,
 for maimed folk to lodge
in, and attend the troubling of the waters. How well was Gods bounty
and mans charity here met together? Commendable it was that rich
men did not engross 
this Spaw
 to themselves, but permitted poor people
not able to use Physick and Surgery the benefit thereof. This Hospitall
for building consisted of 
five
 
Porches;
 not that the defective in the five
senses, lame, blinde, deaf, &c. were here severally disposed of by them∣selves,
but no doubt all promiscuously put together. In this 
Colledge of
Cripples,
 he for his seniority might have been the 
Master
 thereof, who had
been longer lame, then most men live, and now past the fift 
climactericall



of his disease, where with he had been afflicted full 
thirty eight
 years. In∣deed
so impossible was the conditions of his recovery, that being lame,

He must run, before he could goe,
 for seeing 
the first commer was only served,
 he
must hast with speed into the pool after the moving thereof: whilst he,
alas, wanted strength to help himself, wanted money to hire others, and
others wanted mercy freely to give him their assistance. But because he
could not goe to health, 
Health
 was graciously pleased to come to him,
and he was cured miraculously by our
 Saviour.


§ 17. And thus much of the Walls,
 Gates, Towers, and Waters about

Ierusalem:
 come we now into the City it self, which anciently consisted
of two principall parts (therefore 
dual
 in the Hebrew) 
Sion
 on the south∣west,
and 
Ierusalem
 (properly so called) on the north thereof, which
we proceed in order to describe, with the places of principall note there∣in
contained.






CHAP. VII. Of Davids Palace, the High-priests houses, the Coenaculum, and other
memorable places in mount Sion.


§ 1. WE begin with mount 
Sion,
 making that first which God
most favoured,
 
who loved the Gates of Sion, more then all the
tabernacles of Iacob.
 Here first our eyes are entertained with the stately
Palace of 
David,
 
Hiram
 King of 
Tyre
 sending him timber and work∣men
for the building thereof. Flat was the roof of this palace, whereon

David
 sate, and from whence he beheld 
Bathsheba
 (hard by is her house)
bathing her self. I cannot excuse her action herein. If policy be jealous,
that hedges may have eares, modesty may suspect lest the motes in the
aire have eyes. But see here divine justice. As this roof was the place
whereon 
Davids
 lust did burn first; so thereon 
Absaloms
 incest did blaze
farthest, lying here with his Fathers Concubines. This he easily did at
the perswasion of 
Achitophel;
 those spurres needing no rowels, which are
to prick forward graceless youth into wantonness. But that hellish Po∣litician
did this to set such a distance betwixt Sire and Son, that the af∣fection
of the one might never meet with the submission of the other,
the breach hereafter being made so deep and wide, that no bridge of re∣conciliation
might be built betwixt them.


§ 2. Under the 
Romans
 this Palace was turned into a
 Castle, where a
Garrison was kept to over-awe the City. Once the honour, now the
terrour; once the beauty, now the bridle of 
Ierusalem.
 Upon
 the fair
stairs leading thereto, stood Saint 
Paul
 when he made his speech to the
people, hearing him with great silence, because he spake 
in
 
the Hebrew
tongue;
 untill he came to that passage of 
preaching to the Gentiles
 (which
though spoken in Hebrew was no good Hebrew to his auditours, but


false construction, & breach of Jewish priviledg) when they turned their
attentive eares into railing tongues, 
away with such a fellow from off the earth.


§ 3. And now to shew the frailty of humane happiness, pass we from
the palace of these Kings to their burying place, seeing 
Sion
 in a double
respect may be called the 
Westminster
 of 
Ierusalem;
 because the Kings there∣of
resided there while living, and rested when dead. The reader shall pay
nothing but his pains in following me, whilest I shew him these royall
remains. We may observe four gradations of honour in these interments.



1 Wicked
 
Amon
 was buried in his own house, (not under the
roof, but within the verge of the wall thereof) and so was
 
Ma∣nasseh,

whose true but late repentance was effectuall to save his
soul, but not his kingdome from destruction.


2 Cruell 
Ioram,
 who had no compassion whilest living, & therefore
no
 bowels whē dying, was buried by himself in the
 
city of David,

& neither 
fire
 nor 
water,
 neither 
burning
 nor 
mourning
 made for him.


3 Godly, but leprous 
Uzziah,
 being ceremoniously unclean, was
interred 
in the
 
field of the buriall which belonged to the Kings;
 under∣stand
it, within the suburbs, but without the walls of their so∣lemn
sepultures.


4 All the rest were intombed in a stately place set apart for that
purpose; namely, 
David
 the holy, 
the man after Gods own heart;




Solomon
 the wise, when old, befooled by his wives: 
Rehoboam
 the sim∣ple,
whose rigour rent ten Tribes from his kingdome: 
Abiah
 the wic∣ked,
but
 valiant and fortunate in fight; 
Asa
 the upright, 
whose
 
heart was
perfect all his days: Iehosaphat
 the just, 
whose
 
heart was lift up in the ways of the
Lord: Ahaziah
 the Idolater, whose onely cōmendation was that he raigned
but
 
one year. Ioash
 the backslider, the lease of whose goodness determined
with his
 uncles life: 
Amaziah
 the rash, worsted in a needless war against
the King of
 
Israel: Iotham
 the peaceable, who built the
 highest gate to the
house of the Lord: 
Ahaz
 the profane,
 
who in the time of his distress, yet
trespassed more against the Lord: Hezekiah
 the pious, who destroied the high
places: 
Iosiah
 the tender-hearted, who
 melted at Gods threatnings,
denounced against the people of the 
Iews.


§ 4. Amongst these still I miss 
Iehojakim,
 and long seeking for his
tombe light at last on the Prophets threatning,
 
he shall be buried with the
buriall of an Asse, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Ierusalem.


§ 5. Now as it were in exchange of 
Iehojakim
 excluded, we finde 
Ie∣
ojada

admitted among the royall interments. Count it not presumption
for a Priests body to intrude amongst Princes bones, seeing not his pride
but the peoples gratitude preferred him to the place, because
 
he had done
good in Israel towards God and his house.
 (Oh if monuments were mar∣shalled
according to mens merits, what change would it cause in our
Churches!) See we here the care the 
Iews
 had of decent burying th
ir dead.
True it is, bodies flung in a bog, will not stick there at the day of judge∣ment;


cast into a wood, will finde out the way; thrown into a dungeon,
will have free egress; left on the highway, are still in the ready road to
the resurrection. Yet seeing they are the Tabernacles of the Soul, yea
the Temples of the holy Ghost, the 
Iews
 justly began, and 
Christians
 com∣mendably
continue the custome of their solemn interment.


§ 6. Farther off from the palace, we finde 
the house of the mighty;
 where

Davids worthies
 lived in a Colledge under 
Ioab
 their President, next the
Kings
 
wine-press
 and his
 
fish-ponds.
 Think not that the Kings of 
Iudah

had onely Crowns, Thrones, and Scepters, the Ensignes of Soveraignty,
for besides these to maintain their state, they had places of profit, so thrif∣ty
as to make their own wine at the best hand.


§ 7. Next we take notice of the houses of 
Annas
 and 
Caiaphas
 both a∣live

 at once, and termed the high-Priests at the same time; one by
courtesie, because lately he had been: the other by right, because at pre∣sent
possessed of the high-Priesthood. Thus that function, which ought
to have been during life by Gods institution, was made alternately annu∣all
by mans innovation. Was not the shining of two Suns together in the
Jewish Church sadly ominous? And was it not high time for God to take
away the office, when men began wantonly to play at 
in and out,
 with that
holy profession? But besides these two high-Priests, there was a third that
had more right then either to the place, our Saviour himself, at the present
brought a prisoner before them. In the house of 
Annas
 an officer wrongful∣ly

 struck him with the palme of his hand, and in the house of 
Caiaphas

he was thrice denyed by
 
Peter,
 adjured by the high-Priest, adjudged to
death, spit upon, blinded, buffeted, with other insolencies offered unto
him. The houses of the high-Priests were far asunder, all which distance
Christ traced on foot; and it is observable, that being posted back∣wards,
and forwards, from 
Annas
 to 
Caiaphas,
 from 
Caiaphas
 to 
Pilate,

from 
Pilate
 to 
Herod,
 from 
Herod
 to 
Pilate,
 from 
Gabbatha
 to 
Golgotha,
 he
traversed all the length and breadth, and most of the considerable places
in the City: Partly to render his passion more publick, 
being made a
spectacle to men and Angels,
 partly that his 
beautifull feet might bring the Gospell
of peace
 into every principall street in 
Ierusalem.


§ 8. Next followeth the 
Coenaculum,
 or
 
large upper-room
 where Christ en∣ded
the Passover, began the Lords supper, and probably afterwards in the
same place appeared to his disciples, where after his ascension, the holy
Spirit
 
in fiery cloven tongues
 fell upon them, enabling them to speak all lan∣guages,
for which some senslesly slandered them to be
 
full of new wine.
 For
the excess thereof may give men more tongue, not moe tongues; and is so
far from making them speak other, that it hinders the pronouncing of
their own language. As for the house of the Virgin 
Mary,
 w
ch
 some make
very fair in moūt 
Sion;
 I say a better was beneath her desert, but a worse was
above her estate. Sure it is, that after hersons sufferings, she privately lived in
the house of 
Iohn
 the Apostle, & 
Iohn
 formerly lay in the bo
om of 
Christ,
 &



Christ
 once lodged in the womb of 
Mary,
 and 
Mary
 was for ever 
hid
 
with
Christ in God.
 O holy chain, ô happy complication!


§ 9. In the last place we come to the prisons (those necessary evills
in a populous City) whereof we finde three severall degrees,



1 The 
dungeon of
 
Malchiah,
 a most nasty place, the mud and mire
whereof shall not be stirred by my pen, lest the ill savour offend
the Reader. Yet good 
Ieremiah
 was forced to lie, and
 
like to die
 there∣in,
had not 
Ebed-melech
 the blackmore procured his 
writ of re∣movall.


2 The 
house of Ionathan
 the Scribe, made a 
prison extraordinary
 of a
private
 dwelling. This little better then the former, so that 
Ie∣remy

counted it a favour at his importunate
 request to be pre∣ferred
thence, into—


3—
The court of the prison,
 the best of all bads; which was part of
the Kings palace, where 
Ieremy
 remained many days, fed with a
piece of bread out of the 
bakers-street
 (a place hard by) till 
Ne∣buchadnezzar

at last gave him a
 
Gaol-delivery.




§ 10. So much of 
Sion,
 forbearing to enlarge my self in the praises
thereof frequent in holy writ. As for that expression,
 
Gods dwelling is in
Sion,
 it seems particularly to relate to that time, when the 
Arke
 resided
there, brought in by
 
David,
 and placed by him in the midst of a Taber∣nacle
which he 
had
 
pitched for it.
 Indeed he designed to make a better
casket for that Jewell, had not God retrenched his resolution by speci∣all

 order, intending 
Solomon
 for that purpose, who many years after re∣moved
this Ark into the Temple he erected.






CHAP. VIII. Of Millo.


AS it is a great grace in a Rhetorician, not to have bald and flat but
clear and fair Transitions; so it is no less beautifull in buildings to
have spacious and handsome passages therein. For this cause the Kings
of 
Israel
 counted no cost too much to be bestowed upon this 
Millo,
 as be∣ing
the common pass between 
Sion
 and 
Ierusalem.
 It was called 
Millo,
 that
is, 
a filling,
 as some would have it, because being naturally a gulfe or con∣cavity,
it was by great expence levelled to be built upon.
 Others con∣ceive
it so named, because filled with the confluxe and confluence of
people, being indeed the largest street in the whole City.
 
David
 began,

 
Solomon
 finished the building thereof. But as once 
Wickam
 Bishop of

Winchester
 wrote in a wall of 
Windsor, This made Wickam;
 in the same sense
it may be said of 
Millo, This made Ieroboam.
 For 
Solomon
 taking notice of
his activity (merit commended men, and beauty women to his favour)
made him 
surveyour of the works
 when he built
 
Millo,
 which brought him


from a private person into publick notice (the first admission is half a
degree to honour) and gave the occasion of his future greatness. In this

 
Millo,
 at the going down to 
Sillah,
 or to the
 bulwark, King 
Ioash
 was
cruelly killed by two of his servants.






CHAP. IX. Of the Princely Palaces in this City.


§ 1. PRoceed we now to the Princely palaces in 
Ierusalem;
 and first we
light on 
the
 
house of the forest of Lebanon,
 built by 
Solomon:
 So
called, because an abridgement of that great forest, wherein (I mean in
the groves and gardens about it) wild beasts of all kinds (if humane
Authors may be beleeved) had their habitation. Here the 
bellowing Harts

are said to 
harbour,
 the 
throating Bucks
 to 
lodge,
 the 
belling Roes
 to 
bed,
 the 
beating
Hares
 to 
forme,
 the 
tapping Conies
 to 
sit,
 and the 
barking Foxes
 to 
kennell.

Strange musick to be heard in the midst of a populous place; and very
pleasant, that such a woody retiredness should be afforded in the heart of a
City. Yet 
Solomons
 minde, when mounted on these seeming felicities, was
as far from reaching true contentment, as the tired traveller, when on the
top of the next hill, will be from touching the skies, which whilest he
was in the valley seemed contiguous thereunto.


§ 2. The length of this house was an hundred,
 breadth fifty, height
thirty cubits, whereby it appears both longer and broader then the
Temple it self. And no wonder, for who will deny that 
White-Hall
 stands
on more ground then 
Westminster-Abby-Church?
 Besides, in measuring the
Temple, onely the covered part thereof is reckoned on, without the
Courts (wherein the greatest capacity thereof did consist:) whereas no
doubt, Courts and all are taken in to make up the aforesaid dimensions
in 
Solomons house.
 But grant the Kings Palace outspread the Temple in
greatness, the Temple out-topped it in height; whose towred porches as∣cended

 
an hundred and twenty cubites.
 In this house 
Solomons
 golden shields
and targets wer
 kept, till
 carried away by 
Shishak
 King of 
Egypt.


§ 3. Besides this 
Solomon
 had another house in 
Ierusalem
 which was

 thirteen years in building; and a
 third which he made for his wife
the daughter of 
Pharaoh.
 Say not, they needed two houses, which had
two Religions, for we finde not that she ever seduced 
Solomon
 to idolatry:
nor are the 
Egyptian
 Idols reckoned up among those severall
 superstiti∣ons,
which his second brood of wives brought into 
Ierusalem.
 Enough
to perswade some that this match was made by dispensation, if not di∣rection
of God himself, (typifying the calling of the Gentiles) and that

Pharaohs
 daughter afterwards became a convert, following the Psalmists
counsell, 
Forget
 
also thine own people, and thy fathers house.
 Hereabouts al∣so
was the Golden throne of 
Solomon,
 to which those golden Lions gave


a stately ascent. It was the prayer of loyall
 
Benaiah, make the throne of So∣lomon
greater then the throne of my Lord King David,
 which accordingly came
to pass, whether taken for this his materiall throne, or for the largeness
and fulness of his royall authority.


§ 4. Pass we by the Castle of 
Antiochus,
 built by him as a bridle to
the City;
 as also the Palace of the 
Maccabees,
 wherein for many yea
s they
made their residence, first built by
 
Simon
 west of the Temple. In 
Christs

time 
Herod the great
 had in 
Ierusalem
 a most magnificent house, wherein
his grandchild 
Herod Antipas
 Tetrarch of 
Galilee
 kept his passeover, when

Pilate
 sent 
Christ
 unto him to be examined by him. Right glad was 
He∣rod

of this occasion, because though formerly much conversing with

Iohn the Baptist, yet Iohn did no
 
miracle,
 which he now in vain hoped to
behold from our Saviour. For he that would not work a miracle at his
mothers
 motion, would not doe it for his persecutors pleasure. Let

Herod
 take this for a sign that 
Christ
 was the 
Son of God,
 because he would
shew no sign for the will of man. However the silent shew of our
Saviour wrought a reconciliation betwixt him and 
Pilate, which before
were at
 
enmity betwixt themselves.
 But alass the innocent 
Lambe
 is not long
liv'd, when thus both Wolfe and Fox are agreed against him.


§ 5. Appendant to this 
Palace
 was the prison wherein 
Peter
 was put,

and being to dye the next day, was found in a dead
 sleep the night be∣fore.
I question whether 
Herod
 who condemned him, slept half so
soundly. He must be smote before he could be waked, and his shackles
fell off easier then his sleep. The 
Rhemish
 note tells us, that the chains
wherewith he was bound are still preserved at 
Rome
 in the Church of

Petri ad vincula.
 But if those there be the true chains, I dare boldly say,
that others of richer metall, and finer making, more worth, and less
weight, are daily worn by 
Peters
 pretended successour.


§ 6. 
Pilates Palace
 must not be forgotten,
 wherein our 
Saviour
 was
accused by the 
Iews:
 near whereunto was the Judgement-hall, called

 
Gabbatha,
 or the 
Pavement.
 But how even, or smooth soever the stones
were laid in the floor thereof; most rough, harsh, and unequall justice
was administred in this place, when our Saviour therein was condem∣ned.
This was the place, into which the high-Priests prepared for the
Passeover would not
 enter for fear of pollution. 
O my soul enter not into
their secrets, whose fe
 are swift to shed bloud,
 but legs lame to lift themselves
over the threshold of a 
judgement-hall,
 for fear of defilement. Now all
these Princely Palaces were not extant in this City at the same time, but
successively: and therefore as Poets, when they present Persons, who
lived in severall ages, on the same stage, lay their scene in the 
Elysian fields;

so to put these Palaces together, the reader must suppose their dust and
ruines did all meet on the floor of this City, though made in our map in
a flourishing estate, the better to adorn our description of 
Ierusalem.








CHAP. X. Of the Colledges in Jerusalem.


§ 1. PAss we now from the Court,
 to the Innes-of-Court, namely
such places, wherein youth had liberall education. The
 
Iews

tell us of four hundred and fourscore Synagogues at 
Ierusalem
 for this
purpose. We will insist onely on such as we finde named in Scripture,
and begin with 
Huldah's
 
colledge,
 wherein that Prophetess lived in the
days of 
Iosiah.
 Perchance a female foundation of women alone, and
she the 
Presidentress
 thereof; though surely not bound with any mo∣nasticall
vow of virginity, because there also styled 
the wife of Shallum.


§ 2. Next, in the days of the 
Maccabees,
 we take notice of the 
Grecian
Colledge
 or 
Gymnasium,
 erected by 
Iason
 the high Priest, wherein the Jewish
youth were taught to wrestle,
 ride horses, and other Grecian accom∣plishments.
Indeed archery was an ancient Jewish exercise, (
David
taught the children of Israel the use of the
 
how, as it is written in the book of Iasher
)
but these were pure heathenish imployments. Here also they were taught
to wear a garment called 
, which some translate 
Hats,
 others

buskins,
 (though head and feet are far asunder) which whether it were
the generall garbe of the 
Grecians,
 or onely an Academicall habit to
distinguish the Students from common Citizens, let others enquire.
But the worst of all was, here they were taught, not onely 
uncircumcision
of omission,
 (neglecting the observing thereof on infants) but also the 
un∣circumcision
of commission,
 practising to
 
make themselves uncircumcised,
 studi∣ously
deleting the character of that Sacrament out of their bodies.


§ 3. After Christs ascension we finde five Colledges or Synagogues
mentioned in one
 verse,
 all disputing against Saint 
Steven,




Out of 
Asia
 those of 
Cilicia,
 and
proper 
Asia.


Out of 
Africa,
 those of the 
Cyreni∣ans

and 
Alexandrians
 in 
Egypt.


Out of 
Europe,
 those of the 
Libertines of Rome.



Behold here an admirable 
Act
 hept, wherein Saint 
Steven
 was the 
An∣swerer,

against whom 
Opponents
 were fetched from all the parts of the then
known world; and all too few 
to resist the wisedome and Spirit by which he
spake.
 What this Synagogue of 
Libertines
 was, is much controverted by
learned men. Surely 
Libertines
 here are not taken in the modern notion
of the word, for 
such as used their liberty for an occasion
 
to the flesh,
 or
 
a cloak
of maliciousness,
 though we confess in after ages such grew into a nume∣rous
society, whereof Satans subtilty, and mans corruption the 
Founders,

the negligence and conivence of Magistrates the daily 
Benefactours:
 A
Colledge, whose gates (like those of hell) stand always open, having
no other Statutes then the Students pleasure: where the diet is so dear,
that their 
Commons
 cost the souls of such as feed on them, without their
finall repentance. Most probable it is, that by 
Libertines
 were intended


such 
Romans
 as were manumised, or made free by their Masters; where∣of

Tacitus
 counts no fewer then four thousand in the City of 
Rome,
 which
professed the Jewish Religion; some whereof with most likelyhood
had their Synagogues in 
Ierusal
m,
 wherein they were more perfectly
instructed in matters both of doctrine and discipline. The 
Gazith
 or

Common-councell
 must not be omitted, coming near to the nature of a Col∣ledge,
wherein the 
Sanhedrin
 or 
seventy Elders
 had their judicatory, before
whom the Disciples were summoned, and
 straitly threatned not to
preach, and afterwards, for disobeying their Order, were put into the


common Prison.
 In the same
 place Saint 
Steven
 was accused and passed
his purgation, in that excellent speech, that he was no enemy to the Law
of 
Moses,
 if rightly understood.






CHAP. XI. The remainder of private houses and streets in Jerusalem.


§ 1. AMongst the private,
 dwelling in this City, we take speciall
notice of the house of 
Mary,
 the mother of 
Iohn-Mark,
 wherein
the Saints were assembled to pray for 
Peters
 enlargement. Hither he
came and knocked at the door, when 
Rhoda
 portress thereof,
 
opened not
the gate for gladness;
 whether because loth to lose so much time, as the
opening thereof did necessarily require, (conceiving that 
Peter
 might
better stand without the door, then the people stay without the
news) or because her soul, surprized with suddain joy, was not at leasure
to actuate her hands to open the door: yet it informed her feet, 
to run into
the house,
 because that motion (was not, as the other, against the stream,
but) went along with the tyde of her affection, so desirous to tell the
news unto others. Sure I am, 
Peter
 got less harm by this maidens keeping
him out for a time, out of this godly house, then he did by another

Damosels
 letting him into the high-Priests Palace.


§ 2. Adde to this the house of 
Ananias
 the high-Priest,
 which stood
not far off. If therein there was any rotten wall
 
well whit
d over,
 it may
pass for an embleme of him the hypocriticall owner thereof. As this
was the house of a false man, so we take 
Veronica's
 to be a false house, yea
meer fiction, shewn to pilgrimes at this day, in the corner of a street.
Here she is said, that meeting our Saviour when carrying his Cross, she
t
ndred unto him her vai
 therewith wiping off his sweat, which vail
thereby presently received the lively impression and portraicture of his
face and complexion: with more probability they might affirme, that
the picture of his see
 remained in the
 haire of 
Mary Magdalen.


§ 3. So much for particular houses.
 Now that 
Ierusalem
 was digest∣ed
and methodized into severall streets is most certain, whereof such
frequent mention
 in Scripture: as sure it is also, that many fair market


places were found therein, where children
 played with their mates,
Merchants met with their Chapmen, Labourers
 waited for Masters
to hire them, and 
Pharisees
 bartered their outside sanctity for the
 gree∣tings
and salutations of the people. But the order and fashion of their
severall streets are to us unknown, Scripture affording no certainty there∣in.
And though 
Adrichomius
 seem so accurate in this point, that no 
Lon∣don-beadle

can be better acquainted with the lanes, allies, courts, corners,
of the 
Precinct
 belonging unto him, yet herein he proceeds on his own
fancy, and meer conjecture. Onely we meet with the names of two
streets, 
Water-gate-street,
 and 
Ephraim-gate-street,
 which may justly be con∣cluded
more spacious, and roomthy then the rest, because preferred be∣fore
all other places in the City to build booths therein at that solemn
festivall, in the days of
 
Nehemiah.
 In the former of these, 
Ezra
 assem∣bled
the people, and read the law before the
 Congregation.


§ 4. Give me leave to supply out of 
Iosephus
 three eminent places,

though not mentioned in Scripture. First, the
 
Amphitheatre,
 erected by

Herod,
 so capable that it could contain fourscore thousand people, if the
readers beliefe be so large as to give credit thereunto. Here 
Herod,
 after
the fashion of the 
Romans,
 exposed condemned persons to encounter
with Lions, Bears, Boars &c. But whether Saint 
Paul,
 when 
after the
manner of men he fought with beasts at
 
Ephesus,
 intended such combates
with cattell, or onely his contesting with 
 
evill beasts,
 such as the

Cretians
 are
 described to be, is not decided by Divines. Secondly, 
Castle
Antony,
 built by the same 
Herod
 in the honour of 
Antonius,
 to be the keeper,
yea the Gaoler of the Temple, (to which he had an underground passage,
which would hold six hundred men) wherein he observed the motions
of the 
Iews,
 lest they should hatch mutinies under the covert of Religion.
Time was when God himself watched over the Temple to protect it,
till for the sins of the people, he gave it over to be guarded by the jealous
eyes of their inveterate enemies. Lastly, the 
Hippodrome,
 or place for
horse-races, where the Chivalry of the City met on severall occasions.
Sick 
Herod the great
 perceiving his end to approach, and knowing the
same would bring a great joy to the 
Iews,
 (a Tyrants death-day is a
solemn festivall in the Calendar of Nature it self) in this 
Hippodrome
 im∣prisoned
a principall person of every City of 
Iudea,
 enjoining 
Salome
 his
sister to kill them at the instant of his expiring, that so there might be a
generall grief, though not for, yet at his death, whilest no place could
laugh heartily being pinched with their particular loss. However
after his death she discharged those prisoners, and we may easily be∣leeve
that these 
Legatees
 were not offended with her (the Executrix
of 
Herods
 Will) for not disposing the Legacies bequeathed to them,
according to the minde of the Testator.








CHAP. XII. The mysteries of mount Calvary.


§ 1. SUburbs in Cities are like 
Suckers
 in trees,
 which make them
bigger, but not better; so that much of the strength of the City
leaks out in such Excresences. 
Ierusalem
 therefore had no suburbs at all,
but many pleasant mountains and gardens about it. We will begin
with mount 
Calvary,
 and the passage thereunto, commonly called 
the
dolorous way,
 (though thence came all our comfort) traced with the
blessed feet of our Saviour, 
who suffered without the gate.
 This we are now
to describe, and ô that our patience and practise might goe along with
our pen! to observe our Saviours motion, according to the counsell of
the Apostle,
 
Let us goe forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his
reproach.


§ 2. This 
dolorous way
 began at 
Gabbatha
 or the 
Pavement:
 wherein
we may take notice of a wild piece of justice in 
Pilate,
 first scourging,
then crucifying Christ. If his offence was but criminall to deserve
scourging, why was he crucified? If so capitall as to deserve crucifying,
why scourged? Perhaps 
Pilate
 hoped by his scourging to satisfie the
malice of the 
Iews,
 but in vain. For it was not the back-bloud, but the
heart-bloud of Christ must satisfie their thirst. So that what might be
pity in the intent of 
Pilate,
 proved cruelty in the event to Christ; whose
bitter cup hereby was twice filled. Thus we commit double-folded,
twisted, and complicated sins, which our Saviour expiated with dupli∣cated
suffering, first scourged, then crucified.


§ 3. Hence being condemned he
 bare his own Cross part of the
way,
 towards the place of execution, according to the custome of male∣factours
(and we know what 
Furcifer
 inports in the naturall significa∣tion
thereof) untill, it seems, at last he fainted under the burden thereof;
whereof severall reasons are assigned.



1 Probably the 
Iews
 malice provided him a Cross of extraordina∣ry
greatness, proportionable to the reputed offendour Para∣mount.


2 He was much debilitated with his long watching and sweating
the night before.


3 The edges of the Cross grating his late whip-furrowed back,
might occasion the new bleeding of his wounds, and his weak∣ning
thereby.


4 He bare withall the invisible weight of the sins of mankind, and
Gods anger for the same.



Hereupon a substitute or surrogate was provided for him to bear his
Cross, not out of any mercy, but the deeper malice of his enemies; part∣ly


thereby to reprieve him to a more publick death; not willing he
should die under, to cover him from shame, but upon the Cross, to ex∣pose
him to the greater ignominy: partly, because they were loath he
should goe away so easily as in a fainting fit, and therefore their cruell
kindness reserved him for a more painfull death.


§ 4. 
Simon of Cyrene
 is the person by them compelled to bear his Cross.

Had it been foretold that one 
Simon
 should have carried Christs Cross,
and had one heard 
Simon Peter
 so lately, so solemnly promising,
 
though I
should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee,
 he would hence have certainly
concluded him the party for that service. But it fell out far otherwise;
whilest that 
Simon
 had forsaken his Master (and now was bewailing
his fault) another of that name is found out, coming out of the field,
to carry the Cross before him. Let Heraulds then boast of mens 
bearing,

and their 
blazing
 of armes, (empty huskes where the kernell of vertue is
wanting) behold here a rich bearing indeed; 
A Cross proper
 carried by

Simon
 for our Saviour. We must buckle our selves in like manner for
the same burden, patiently to undergoe afflictions. The best is, our
Crosses are made hollow, being greater in bulk then in burden; seeing
the Cross of our Crosses, eternall damnation, is taken off by the suffer∣ing
of our Saviour.


§ 5. And now Christ comes to the place of execution,
 called 
Golgotha

or mount 
Calvary,
 that is, 
a place of a skull.
 Either from the fashion there∣of,
because that hill was rounded up in the form of a mans head, or be∣cause
mens bones were scattered thereabouts. 
Tremellius
 with great pro∣bability
conceives this 
Calvary
 called the hill
 
Gareb
 in 
Ieremy,
 being de∣scribed

to lie near the valley of the dead bodies.
 Here our blessed Saviour in a
publick place, with infamous company, (who lived amongst 
Publicanes,

and dyed betwixt 
theeves
) after a cruell manner was despightfully cru∣cified.
In whose sufferings we may observe


§ 6. The 
length thereof,
 lasting six tedious houres, exposed all that time
both to hunger and cold. Indeed the theeves were longer in suffering,
both being still
 alive when Christ expired: but they endured but per∣sonall
pain, whilest he underwent miseries for all mankind; so that
what his Passion lacked in the length, it had in


§ 7. The 
breadth
 thereof:
 extended over all the parts and powers
of his soul and body. No part free from pain, save his tongue, left at
liberty to pray for his enemies. His senses all suffered, namely



1 
Seeing,
 tormented with the scornfull gestures, and reproach∣full
postures of such as 
passed by
 
wagging the head,
 to expiate the
lascivious, envious, covetous glances of our eyes.


2 
Hearing,
 grieved with the taunts, jeers, and wilfull
 mistakes of
the Priests and people: so to satisfie for the pleasures our eares
have taken in lustfull Sonnets, wanton jests, and other vain and
wicked delights.



3 
Smelling,
 offended with such savours as may well be presumed to
be none of the best, in the 
place of a skull,
 to make amends for our
luxurie in sents and perfumes.


4 
Tasting.
 For when he cried out, 
I thirst,
 (and sorrowes we say are
dry) they provided him a potion of
 
gall and vineger;
 so to
repair Gods justice offended with our gluttony and drunken∣ness.


5 
Touching,
 his hands and feet being pierced with the nailes, to ex∣piate
the rapin and violence of our hands, the swiftness of our
feet in the way of wickedness, with the manifold sins, which
that sense in us committeth.



What shall I speak of his 
head pierced with Thornes,
 so to make satis∣faction
for the profane plots and projects, the wicked machinations of
our brains? And it is worth our observing, that though the 
Scarlet
Robe
 (put on him to act in that Princely Pageant) was taken from
him, (as of some value, no pain, and too good to be spoiled) yet the

Crown of Thornes,
 painfull to him, and profitable to no other, was, (for
ought we finde) continued on his head, all the time of his passion. In a
word, it is hard to say, whether his pain was more shamefull, or his
shame more painfull unto him: the exquisiteness of his bodily temper,
increasing the exquisiteness of his torment, and the ingenuity of his
Soul, adding to his sensibleness of the indignities, and affronts offered
unto him.


§ 8. Thirdly,
 
depth.
 His passion was as deep as Hell it self, induring
tortures in his wounded Conscience to the apprehension of a desertion;
witness his Exclamation, 
My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!
 not
that really he was forsaken, or totally conceived so, shewing his faith in
the deepest of his distress. For as when twins in the womb of 
Tamar

strove which should come first into the world, the
 mid-wise adjudged
the Primogeniture unto him that first put forth his hand, as a champion
chall
nging his birth-right: so in this expression of our Saviours,
wherin Faith and Fear did contest for the priority, Faith must be esteem∣ed
the heir and eldest, first putting forth his hand, 
My God;
 yea both his
hands, 
My God, my God,
 claiming by that gemination a double interest in
Gods fatherly affection.


§ 19. Lastly,
 the 
height:
 as high as heaven, because the person indu∣ring
it was both innocent and infinite. 
Innocent;
 such he must be to
effect our redemption,
 
without blemish and without spot,
 otherwise had
blurred fingers come to rub off, or wipe out the blot in mans nature,
thereby it had been made the bigger: 
Infinite,
 being no less then the Son
of God, which gave infinite worth and valuation to his sufferings. O
then that we might be able 
to comprehend with all Saints, what is the
 
breadth,
and length, and depth, and height, and might know the Love of Christ that passeth
knowledge,
 so infinite every way were the dimensions thereof.



§ 10. And now he had left all he had to be severally disposed of to
persons most proper to receive them,
 as namely
his



1 
Purse
 (and his own price therein) to 
Iudas, who bare the


 
bag.


2 
Peace
 unto his disciples, and the godly their successours: 
My


 
peace I leave unto you.


3 
Prayers
 to his enemies for their pardon: 
Father forgive
 
them,
they know not what they doe.


4 
Wardrobe
 to the souldiers, who 
parted his raiment amongst them,
and on his vesture did cast lots.


5 
Mother
 to 
Iohn
 the beloved disciple:
 
Woman behold thy Son.


6 
Body
 to 
Joseph
 of 
Arimathea,
 who afterwards
 
begged,
 and
(with 
Nicodemus
) embalmed and buried it.


7 
Soul
 to God:
 
Father into thy hands I commend my Spirit.



These things thus disposed of, 
he bowed his head,
 partly in submission to
Death the messenger, but more in homage to God the sender, and not by
violent compulsion, but voluntary susception of death, 
gave up the ghost.

So ended our Saviours 
satis
ing sufferings,
 as redeemer of mankind;
though his 
sympathizing sufferings,
 as mysticall head of the Church, are
still behind,
 
and are daily filled up with the afflictions
 of his servants. I say
his 
compassion
 daily remains and increaseth, though his 
passion
 was
then, and there ended, according to his own expression,
 
It is finished.


§ 11. Say not that the arrears thereof,
 and another reckoning re∣mained,
because presently after, one pierced his side, out of which came
water and bloud. For this added to their malice, not his misery: accor∣ding
to that expression,
 
Be not afraid of those that kill the body, and after
that have no more that they can doe;
 all cruelties to breathless corps amount to
just nothing, and injuries to the dead though 
figures
 on the account of the
offerers, yet are but 
cyphers
 on the score of the sufferers.


§ 12. Near mount 
Calvary
 was a garden,
 and in that garden a
rock, and in that rock a grave, which 
Ioseph of Arimathea
 had provided
for himself. This was fashionable in that age to make their monu∣ments
in their gardens, so to retrench their wanton thoughts with me∣ditations
of mortality. Thus pleasure, poison in it self, is made whol∣some,
when well corrected with thoughts of our latter end; yea graves
and green herbs make a good medly, seeing
 
all flesh is grass, and the glory
of man as the flower thereof,
 which withereth and falleth away. Here our
Saviour was intombed, 
in a
 
sepulchre bewen in stone, wherein never man be∣fore
was laid;
 it being fit, that as he was born of a virgin-wombe, he
should be buried in a virgin-tombe. It was also 
Iosephs
 own tombe,
intended for his proper interment. Such our Saviours poverty, that as
he lived in lended houses, so he was buried in a borrowed sepulchre,
being rather a tenant, then owner thereof. To make sure work, the
grave was shut with a great stone, the stone fastned with a solemn seal,


the seal guarded with a watch of souldiers; though all in vain. For all
their solicitous care to suppress his resurrection, did but render it more
conspicuous, and free it from all suspicion of forgery.


§ 13. Sure they did binde,
 but loose they did finde. For on the third
day an Angell came down from heaven, causing a great earth-quake;
as if the earth, like a guilty malefactor, trembled with feare, for its for∣mer
boldness, that being made 
Gods footstool,
 it presumed to be his
prison. This earth-quake begat a second in the heart of the souldiers▪
who frighted with fear ran all away, our Saviour being former∣ly
risen out of his sepulchre. For the stone was not
 rolled away by the
Angell to give his body passage out, but to give the disciples eyes pas∣sage
into the grave, to behold the reality of his resurrection: otherwise
he, who came in when 
the
 
door,
 could come out when the grave

was shut.
 A
t
rwards he attested his rising from the dead, by his
manifold appari
ions in sundry places to severall persons, as is largely
recorded in the Gospell.


§ 14. However the Priests to palliate the matter,
 possess the people,
and prevent the propagation of the repo
t, endeavoured by thei
 money
(their coin being better then their cause) whereby they had compassed the
death, thereby also to hinder the beliefe of his resurrection. Though
their seal on his grave was broken, they hoped to s
t a firmer on the lips
of the souldiers, bribing them for the silence of the truth, and disper∣sing
an improbable lye, 
that the Disciples came by night whilest they slept,
and stole him away.
 It is admirable that such a falshood confuting it
self (for if they were asleep, how could they discover them? if awake,
why did they not resist them?) should by Gods permission make it
passage so fast, so far, and so firme in the beliefe of the 
Iews.
 Here taking
the devill (the
 father of all lies) to be father thereof, it is worth
our observing in the very words of the
 Evangelist



1 The mother of the lie, the brains of the 
Pharisees: they taught.


2 The nurse thereof, the tongues of the souldiers: 
they did as they were
taught.


3 The wages of the nurse, ready paiment: 
so they took the money.


4 The well-batling of the babe, it grew very great: 
For it is common∣ly
reported amongst the Iews.


5 The long life thereof, lasting longer then sixteen hundred years,

unto this day.



And it is to be feared it will live next day, next moneth, next year, many
years, if God be not more mercifull in convincing their erroneous judge∣ments.
Thus it is just in heavens proceedings to suffer the posterity to
be poisoned, for the wilfull default of the parents.








CHAP. XIII. Of the Potters-field, Aceldama, Fullers-field &c.


§ 1. PAss we from the north-west,
 to the south-east part of the
City, where, without the walls, we light on the 
Potters-field,

where men of that trade made brittle plate in abundance. For,
although in 
Solomons
 time, such earthen ware was worthless in this
City, when 
silver it self was
 
nothing accounted of,
 and 
made to be
 
as
stones in Ierusalem;
 yet, poor people in after ages, found such cheap fur∣niture
usefull for their estates. Here one might have seen those Potters
absolutely lording it over their clay (purely passive to receive any im∣pression
from them) and, according to their own power and pleasure,
making 
of the same lump one
 
vessell unto honour, and another unto dishonour.

Others conceive, this 
Potters-field
 was onely an inconsiderable wast
place, where sherds and pieces of broken pots were cast out in a by∣corner.


§ 2. Surely it was neither great in extent or value,
 seeing thirty pieces
of silver (the restored reward of 
Iudas
 his treason) could purchase the

fee-simple
 thereof; except any will say, it came at a cheaper rate, be∣cause
intended for a publick and pious use, the 
buriall
 
of strangers.

Here their dead corps had an Hospitall, wherein their lodging and
cloathing was freely bestowed upon them: and thus our Saviour,
though himself a 
Stranger
 in a borrowed
 grave, by the price of
his bloud conferred graves on many 
Strangers.
 As for the confi∣dent
report, that the earth in this field will in forty
 eight houres, con∣sume
the flesh that is laid therein, yea retaining that quality though
transported into forein Countreys, (the grave which every where
hath a voracious 
appetite,
 having here as quick a 
digestion
) my
faith is neither all wax, nor all iron herein. To speak plainly, after
long fighting against an Army of Authors affirming the same, my
beliefe at last is taken captive by their gravity, and number, to give
credit thereunto.


§ 3. It was afterwards called 
Aceldama,
 or 
the field
 
of bloud,
 be∣cause
purchased with the price of Christs bloud, and not (as some
may erroneously conceive) because handselled with the bloud of 
Iudas

therein, when 
his bowells gushed out.
 The place of whose self-execution
is shewen to pilgrimes, some distance hence, on the south-west of
the City, where he, who had lived a
 
thiefe
 to his Master, dyed 
a
felon of himself,
 hanged, say some, on an 
Elder;
 say others,
 on a 
Sycomore

tree; a matter of no concernment.



§ 4. More are we troubled,
 not for 
Iudas
 his sake (for whom two
deaths were not too many) but in behalf of the 
Truth
 (which can be but
one) to reconcile a seeming difference betwixt two places of Scripture
about the manner of his death.

MATTH. 27. 5.
 
And he cast down the pieces of silver
in the Temple, and departed, and
went, and hanged himself.
ACTS 1. 18.
 
And falling headlong, he burst a∣sunder
in the midst, and all his
bowells gushed out.

We understand it thus, not that the rope breaking, 
Iudas
 falling down
thence some steep place, was paunched on some sharp pile; but, that
the very weight of his body, and violence of his headlong motion (ha∣ving
no hopes upward in heaven, and therefore hasting downward to
the center of despair) brake his belly in so precipitate a fall. Thus as Trai∣tors,
when hanged, are by our law to have their bowells 
drawn out
 by
the executioner: so 
Iudas
 served himself so, 
o spare others the pains to
punish him.


§ 5. 
Fullers-field
 must not be forgotten, where they stretched,
 and
dryed their clothes which they they had washed in the brook of 
Cedron.

But all the sope used here by men of that trade, could not scoure the in∣delible
stain of impiety out of the credit and conscience of King 
Ahaz,

who in the 
high-way of
 
the Fullers-field,
 peevishly refused a sign, which
God graciously proffered unto him. And mens severall behaviours in
matters of this nature deserved to be marked. For, it was



1 Commendable in
 
Gideon
 and
 
Hezekiah,
 humbly requesting a
sign for farther strengthening of their weak Faith.


2 Pardonable in
 
Zacharias,
 craving one out of a mixture of infi∣delity,
therefore granted him in loving anger; his 
dumbeness
 ser∣ving
as well to correct, as confirm him.


3 Damnable in the 
Iews,
 who out of pride and presumption, in a
daring way
 demanded; and in 
Herod,
 who out of curiosity

 expected a signe from Christ, and therefore denyed them.



But most of all in 
Ahaz,
 in whose nostrills the very perfumes of Heaven
sented ill, because proffered unto him, refusing to accept a sign so freely
tendered unto him.


§ 6. East of 
Aceldama,
 in the valley 
of the Sons of Hinnon,
 lay 
Tophet
 (that
is, Breadth) as Saint 
Hierome
 expoundeth it, because there the Citi∣zens
of 
Ierusalem,
 pent within the walls of their City, used to dilate, ex∣patiate,
and recreate their spirits in the walks thereof. Pity it was that so
pleasant a place should afterwards be poisoned with Idolatry, where
children were offered to 
Moloch,
 searing them to death with his burning
imbracements; of the manner whereof largely herefter. For the pre∣sent
let it suffice us to observe, that 
Iosiah
 is said to
 
defile this place:
 what!
was it capable of more pollution then what it had before? Understand
it, by burning of dead bones therein, he made it as offensive to the


nostrils of men, as formerly it had been odious in the eyes of God. Now
as the stinking lake of 
Avernus
 in 
Italy,
 passeth in Pagan Poets for 
Hell
 it
self: so this valley of 
Ben-hinnon (Gehenna
 in Greek) is used in the same
sense by our
 Saviour: either because of the abominable impieties here
committed by the parents; or exquisite torments here endured by the
children.


§ 7. We conclude with the place wherein Saint 
Steven
 was stoned,

being on the east of the City, some distance from what at this day is
termed Saint 
Stevens-gate:
 nigh which they shew the place where 
Saul

sate, when he kept the clothes of those that stoned him. Now, seeing
by 
Davids
 law,
 made by the brook 
Besor,
 he that tarrieth by the stuffe is
to be equall sharer in the spoile with those that goe forth to the battell;
the equity of this ordinance arraigneth 
Saul
 guilty alike of the bloud of
Saint 
Steven,
 with those whose wardrobe he kept during the time of the
execution. But, whatsoever 
Sauls
 share was in the murther, great was
his part in the prayer of Saint 
Steven,
 whose
 petition 
(Lord lay it not to
their charge
) is justly accounted by Divines, a promoting means of his
speedier conversion.

THE
DESCRIPTION OF
SOLOMONS TEMPLE.




CHAP. I. Davids threefold preparation for the Temple.


§ 1. 
I
T will not I hope be censured superstition,
 if at
the Threshold of this Temple, we fall flat in ve∣neration
of the God thereof, to guide us in the en∣suing
discourse. The subject whereon we enter
is 
holy ground,
 may both writer and reader 
put off
their shoos,
 and devesting themselves, as much as
may be, of carnall corruption, come with simplicity, and sincerity to
the matter now undertaken.


§ 2. As some previous dispositions,
 and antecedaneous acts are re∣quired
of a Christian, before he be perfectly converted, and become the

Temple of the holy Ghost;
 so some preparatory provisions were necessary to be
made before the building of the Temple was taken in hand. Holy

 
Samuel
 was the first we finde, who stored up any wealth to this purpose;
and 
Saul
 (probably invited with his example) dedicated things to the
same intent. Yea
 
Abner
 and 
Ioab
 (though at deadly feud each against
other) agreed both in consecrating 
spoiles won in battells t
 maintain the house
of the Lord.
 But 
David
 exceeded all other, before-hand providing the
materialls wherewith, prescribing the pattern whereby, and purchasing
the ground whereon the Temple should be erected.


§ 3. First,
 for materialls. Lest he or his son should be recounted a∣mongst
those
 foolish builders, 
which began and were not able to finish,
 vast
were his preparations for this purpose, in those his two large showres


of his liberality, which we may call 
the former and latter raine
 of his
bounty on the Temple.


The former 
1 Chr. 22. 14.
 
An hundred thousand
Talents of gold, and 

thousand thousand talents
of silver, and of brass and
iron without weight.
The latter 
1 Chr. 29 4. 7.
 
Three thousand talents of gold of Ophir, and seven thou∣sand
talents of refined silver, 
given by
 David 
of his own
proper goods. Besides given by the Princes of the people,

of gold fiv
 thousand talents, and ten thousand drams, and
of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thou∣sand
talents, and an hundred thousand talents of iron.

In the first oblation was given what they had suddainly gotten by their
valour, in the latter, what they had leasurely advanced by their diligence.
In the first their own, but taken from their enemies; in the latter their
own, but saved from themselves: in both
 
Gods own,
 as 
David
 confesseth,
who first bestowed it on them, and they now restored it to his service.


§ 4. Come we now to examine how much a 
Talent,
 in Hebrew

Chichar,
 did contain. Whereof in Scripture we finde these generalls.



1 One man could not conveniently carry two Talents, and there∣fore

 
Naaman bound two Talents of silver in two bags, and laid them upon
two of his servants.


2 One man might easily beare one Talent, not onely on his back,
but on his head, and that not as a burden, but ponderous or∣nament.
Thus the Crown of the King of 
Ammon,
 afterwards
worn by 
David,
 weighed a Talent, besides precious stones. Ex∣cept
any will say, that the heaviness thereof rested more on the
subjects hands, then on the Soveraigns head, who by 
grand∣sergeantry

ma
 be presumed to support the same.


3 Probably 
 
ontained more then ten thousand 
Adarconim,
 (or

drams,
 as 
r translations render it) because in the
 aforesaid
text, after entire talents were reckoned up, these 
drams
 follow as
a fraction or broken sum, not amounting to a whole talent.


4 The particular value thereof may be collected out of
 
Exodus,

that every talent contained three thousand 
shekels,
 or fifteen hun∣dred
ounces, which in gold according to three pound the ounce,
amounteth to four thousand five hundred pound of English
money.



According to this standard the hundred thousand talents of gold given
by 
David
 in the first oblation, make up four hundred and fifty millions,
as an excellent
 Critick hath accounted it.


§ 5. Here as that infidell Prince conceived,
 if
 windows were made
in heaven, such plenty of food could not follow in 
Samaria
 as the Prophet
foretold; so more will be of the minde, that if 
Pluto
 should let open all
his trap-doors, melt all his mines into money, so great a sum could not
suddainly be advanced. This hath given the ground to their probable
opinion, who conceive that 
Talent
 in the first oblation of 
David
 is there
taken onely for a plain or flat plate of gold of small value,(as anciently


in
 
Homer
 it passeth in the same acception) whilest in the second offe
ing
Talent is used in the exact and strict notion, according to the full value
aforesaid, whose judgement is strengthened by the following argu∣ments.



1 Surely 
Solomon
 was the
 richest of all the Kings of 
Israel
 before or
after him, bu
 verily I say unto you, that 
Solomon
 in all his wealth
and trienniall returns from 
Tarshish,
 was far inferiour to 
David,

if the Talents there mentioned were full and entire according to
the first computation.


2 What is said of our Saviours deeds by way of hyperbole, that

if they
 
were all written, the world it self could not contain the books that
should be written,
 may be literally affirmed of 
Davids
 treasure in the
first oblation. For as the silver there mentioned was tenfold
more then the gold; so if it be allowed (what in moderate pro∣por
ion
cannot be denied) that the unweighed 
Brass
 was ten∣fold
to the 
Silver,
 and the 
Iron
 to the 
Brass,
 the whole content of
the
 Temple was not sufficient to comprehend so mighty a
mass.


3 Though the second offering of 
David
 was far short of the first in
number of Talents, yet it is beheld in Scripture as most solemn
and of highest importance. At the presenting whereof greatest
gratitude to God, and mutuall exultation amongst men was

 expressed. This insinuates that at this rere-account, the 
Talents

were 
Talents
 indeed, and though in number fewer, in worth
more considerable then the former.



Wherefore though we conceive not the long life of the Patriarchs a
sufficient cause (as some doe) to expound their age of lunary years, yet
the strength of these reasons carry our beliefe along with them to con∣tract
the accep
ion of talents in the first account, as is above stated.


§ 6. But to close up all concerning 
Talents:
 It was so great a sum, that
though now so many thousands of them abounded in 
Ierusalem,
 yet af∣ter wards in the reign of 
Iehojakim,
 one talent of gold and an hundred
talents of silver, was found and felt an heavy annuall taxation for the
whole City of 
Ierusalem
 and kingdome of 
Iudah
 to pay. Insomuch, 
that
he
 
exacted it of every one in the land,
 to make up that sum for the King of

Egypt
 So great is the difference betwixt the same place, when flowing
with wealth, and when exhausted with war.


§ 7. After all these preparations made,
 let not 
Davids
 expression be
condemned of complement, 
Now behold, in my
 
poverty I have provided for
the house of the Lord &c.
 as if he were like those fond ente
tainers, who
having forraged the elements of aire, earth and water for provision for
their guests, still excuse their cheer for being no better. His words were
indited from an humble heart, finding his deeds so far short of his de∣sires,
of Gods deserts. Thus those who have given a little to God, think


they have given much, whilest such as have given much, know they
have given but a little.


§ 8. Here it will be demanded,
 that seeing at the building of the
Tabernacle, peoples bounty was refrained with a flat
 prohibition to
bring in no more, why no such restraint appears at the building of the
Temple, where far greater masses of metall were presented for the
erection thereof. But it is answered, that moderate or competent state
best became the Tabernacle, resembling the kingdome of grace; whilest
the Temple was not capable of excess in magnificence, representing the
kingdome of glory. No hands could contribute too much to the Type,
where no heart can conceive enough of the truth, 
the things which God hath
prepared
 
for them that love him,
 not entering into humane imagination.


§ 9. Besides these materialls,
 
David
 prescribed the modell, 
which he
gave to Solomon his son, the pattern of the porch and of the houses thereof, and of the
treasures thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours
thereof, and of the palace of the Mercy-seat, and the pattern of all that he had by the


 
Spirit.
 And it followeth not far after, 
All this
 (said 
David) the Lord
made mee to understand in writing, by his hand upon me, even all the
works of this pattern.
 Here 
David
 for the more certainty, had a double
direction, one 
by the Spirit,
 the other 
by writing,
 to stand on record 
in per∣petuam
rei memoriam.
 These two did not contradict, but confirm each
other, because he, who hath learned his lesson most perfectly by heart,
may notwithstanding sometimes have need to have recourse unto, and
make use of his notes.


§ 10. However herein the note of the 
Geneva translation
 is very consi∣derable,

 thus glossing on the text. 
For all this was left in writing in the book of
the Law, Exod. 15. 40. which book the King was bound to put in execution.
Deut. 17. 19.
 Thus making 
David
 not by propheticall revelation, but
prudentiall collection, to arrive at the knowledge of the 
Prototype of the
Temple,
 by 
a writing,
 being (no new or immediate manuscript from hea∣ven,
but) the ancient Scripture, delivering the modell, and dimensions
of the Tabernacle to 
Moses.
 Yet so, that the dead letter in the word, was
quickened and enlivened in 
Davids
 heart by Gods Spirit, teaching him
to observe a generall conformity betwixt the Tabernacle and Temple,
yet with those due and necessary alterations, as were requisite be∣twixt
the one a small and moveable fabrick, and the other a large and
standing structure. An interpretation easier cavilled at, then confuted,
because such the 
Analogy betwixt
 these two edifices.

—Facies non una duabus,


Nec diversa tamen, qualis decet esse sororum.


Their faces neither diverse, nor the same,


But such as sisters very well became.

The latter being none other, then the imitation of the former with pro∣portionable
addition: as indeed what is the Tabernacle of Grace, but
the Temple of Glory contracted; or the Temple of Glory, but the Ta∣bernacle
of Grace dilated?



§ 11. This *
 pattern was imparted to 
David,
 (who had the holier,
though 
Solomon
 the larger heart) and no doubt his son exactly observed
the same. Yet can I not beleeve that 
Solomon
 was altogether so pattern-bound,
as 
Moses,
 who was so confined to his
 instruction, that his hand
might not write a letter, yea not make a flourish, more then was in his
Copy: And a knop or flower in the Candlestick under or over, was a
mortall transgression. More probable it is, that 
Hirams
 fancy, (
Solomons
Architect
) was not 
pressed
 in all particulars, but was left a 
volunteire
 for
some descants of Art, whilest for the main, he kept himself to the
ground-work prescribed unto him.


§ 12. Besides 
materialls,
 and 
modell, David
 purchased the floor where∣on
the Temple was erected; a floor paved with mysteries. Here on
mount 
Moriah,
 an Angell
 stayed the stretched-out hand of 
Abraham
 from
killing 
Isaac,
 and in the same place, God stayed the
 sword of the de∣stroying
Angell, from slaying the 
Israelites
 with the pestilence. No
place therefore more precious, more cordiall, or soveraign to build a
Temple in, then this, which was twice confirmed with 
Probatum est,

stamped with a double impression of Gods favour upon it. This floor

David
 bought of 
Araunah
 the 
Iebusite,
 from whom he would not take it
of gift, that hereafter it might not be said, that the Temple had no bet∣ter
title to the ground whereon it was built, then the meer gratuity of
such a man, whom most conceive to be but a Pagan. Indeed a main
matter to make a structure stand firme, is to found it on ground lawful∣ly
purchased, and honestly payed for, otherwise that floor, which for
substance is a rock, will in point of right be found but a sandy foun∣dation.


§ 13. On this place 
David
 built an Altar,
 giving it this large cha∣racter,

This
 
is the house of the Lord God, and this is the Altar of the burnt-offering
for Israel.
 Now as the heart is the 
Primum vivens
 in a creature; so this
Altar was the first thing erected in the Temple, though for the present
made of such mean matter as that hasty occasion would give leave. Here
it stood many years after, even untill the brazen Altar of a firmer Fa∣brick
was substituted in the room thereof. Either to this did 
Ioab
 fly,
and caught hold in vain of the horns thereof, (three years before the
Temple was built) or else to some other Altar near the Tabernacle in

Sion
 For seeing those passages betwixt him and 
Solomon
 were transacted
in the City of 
Ierusalem,
 certain it is, he fled not to the Altar as yet at
 
Gi∣beon,

distanced some miles from this place.


§ 14. If it be demanded why 
David
 thus diligent to provide for the
Temple,
 was forbidden to build it; a double reason is rendered thereof.
First, because he had been 
a
 
man of war;
 and his martiall reign incum∣bred
with constant battells, afforded not a peaceable conveniency su∣table
to such a design. Secondly, because 
he had shed much bloud upon the
earth in Gods sight,
 which principally related to his killing of 
Uriah.
 Say


not that 
Solomon
 also 
was a man of bloud,
 having ordered the executions of

 
Ioab, Shimei,
 and 
Adoniah,
 doing it in a judiciall way, not violent and
murdering manner, as 
David
 had done. And although his serious re∣pentance
had cured the wound in his conscience, yet God suffered the
scare in his credit so far to remain, as to render him uncanonicall, or
irregular for such an imployment. However, in some sense 
David
 may
be said to have built the Temple: Namely, in Gods gracious
 accepti∣on
of the readiness of his will for the performance thereof.






CHAP. II. An army of workmen imployed by Solomon in the
building of the Temple.


§ 1. NOw 
Solomon
 his son being a peaceable Prince,
 as his name
imports, in his quiet reign began the building of the Tem∣ple.
Thus as Cryers make an 
Oyes
 to silence all noise, that
men may the better attend to the Judge when beginning his Charge; so
by a generall peace, 
the rage of all people was stilled,
 before God in the Oracle
did begin his familiar discourse with the 
Israelites,
 or the foundation of
the Temple taken in hand. Then 
Solomon
 enters on the work, employ∣ing
in mount 
Lebanon,
 a vast army of workmen, in their severall distan∣ces
to advance this Fabrick.


§ 2. Namely,
 for servile work, an
 hundred and fifty thousand
bearers of burdens, and hewers of stone and wood. All these were
strangers, 
Solomon
 reserving his native subjects for their purses to pay
taxes, not persons to bear burdens. Secondly, for plain work; in which
thirty thousand 
Israelites
 were imployed, yet with such
 alternation, that,
divided in three parts, they stayed one moneth in mount 
Lebanon,
 and
the other two at home. Thirdly, for carved-works; herein the 
Sidonians

onely were used, whose exact number is not specified: But they must
needs be numerous, if we may guess the men by their mouthes, and
their mouthes by the
 proportion of victualls allowed them. Lastly,
above all for direction three thousand three hundred were appointed
(surely so many officers would suffer no drones to be in the whole
hive) to oversee the rest.


§ 3. Such,
 who admire how so many could so long be busied in
such a building, would haply have wondred more, how so few in so
short a time could have finished the same, had they beheld the magni∣ficence
thereof. Two great gulfes there were, which insensibly swal∣lowed
up the labours of many thousands of men. First, the want of
horses in 
Iudea
 (plenty whereof were brought out of 
Egypt
 towards the
latter end of King 
Solomons
 reign) whereupon massie timber in those
mountainous countreys, were managed by the main strength of men.


The second was a religious Criticisme peculiar to this structure, all
things being beforehand so framed and fitted in mount 
Lebanon,
 that

not so much as the sound of an Axe, or Hammer was heard in Ierusalem, when it
came to be erected.
 Which exactness must needs occasion many charge∣able
essayes and samples, before it could be attained. Nor wanted there
a mystery therein, because as the moving Tabernacle typified the 
Church
Militant;
 so the Temple resembled the 
Triumphant,
 where those who
shall be thought worthy to be admitted into glory, shall have nothing
to doe, but to be admitted into glory.


§ 4. Some will say with
 
Nicodemus,
 How could these things be,
 that no
noise should be made at the erecting thereof? suppose but a bedstead
having head, sides, feet, posts, tester, cords, and curtains fitted before, it
cannot be set up without some necessary noise. Yea grant their ham∣mers
or mallets cased with some soft matter, to bribe them to silence,
yet they could not be made so mute, but that the very contusion and en∣forcement
of the aire, would unavoidably advance some sound. Nor
were the beams of the Temple so far in love with their mortises, as to
run into them, or the mortises so fond of the beams, as to embrace them
of their own accord.


§ 5. In answer hereto,
 some plead miracle, others exquisite Art, and
several kindes of cementing, souldering, rivetting, screwing, glewing, and
other devices unknown to our age. As for the 
Rabbinicall
 fancy, that 
Solo∣mon

with the bloud of the worme 
Thamyr
 effected this matter, most
will account it improbable in it self, and unproportionable to Scripture.
Others distinguish on the degrees of the noise; small in comparison of
so great a work, and not obstreperous to a publick disturbance. But the
best interpret it, that no laborious sound was heard from the hewing or
squaring of timber, or stone, but onely a more cheerfull, yea melodi∣ous
harmony, from the happy conjunction, and compacting of parts to∣gether,
now easily matched, which had been contracted before. This I am
sure, that what tongue-tied tools soever, were used at the erecting of the
Temple, too clamorous instruments were imployed at the destruction
therof, 
when they brake down the
 curved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.


§ 6. Besides the two gulfes aforesaid,
 (the quick-sands of many
mens labours) it is also to be considered, that though so wise a King as

Solomon▪
 would not burden himself with superfluous numbers, yet in this
Fabrick, wherein he did personate and represent the great God of hea∣ven,
he consulted more with his magnificence, then his frugality, not
minding so much how many the building in bare necessity did require,
but how many the builders with full authority could command.


§ 7. Notwithstanding so many labourers entertained in the work,

seven years was this Temple in building. Here some will behold the
sanctity and perfection of the 
septenary number,
 so often occuring in
Scripture, whilest we conceive this the best reason, why just seven years


were spent in the building thereof, because it could not be ended in six,
nor accomplished within a shorter compass of time. Indeed almost
twice as much time (thirteen years) did 
Solomon
 spend in building his
own house: whereof this fair and ingenuous reason is rendered by

 
Iosephus; because he was not so intent and earnest therein, as in the structure of
the Temple.
 It is in another case reported to the praise of 
Boaz,
 
the man
will not be at rest, untill he have finished the thing;
 so 
Solomon,
 during those seven
years of the Temples building, did not sleep in a cessation from, nor
slumber in an interruption of that work, which was intended for the
honour of God. Though in erecting his own Palace, as he made it for
his pleasure, so he did it at his leasure; as conveniencies would permit.






CHAP. III. Of the generall dimensions of the Temple.


§ 1. THe length of this Temple was
 sixty Cubites (besides ten
Cubits for the Porch,
 which compleat the whole length, se∣venty)
the breadth thereof twenty, the height thirty.
Here we may take notice of a manifest difference betwixt the Scripture
and the writer of the Jewish antiquities; both for the time, wherein
the Temple was built, and the dimensions thereof.


Scripture. 1 KING. 6. 1.
 
Four hundred and fourscore years af∣ter
the children of Israel came out of
the land of Egypt.
1 KING. 6. 2.
 
The height thereof thirty Cubits.
Iosephus Ant. Iud. li. 8. c. 2.
 
Five hundred ninety and two years af∣ter
the departure of the Israelites out
of Egypt.
Ibidem.
 
The whole height of the Temple was
six score Cubits.

A difference which will make no impression on his Faith, who hath
read Saint 
Peters
 resolution,
 
We ought to obey God rather then man;
 Such
passages not unusuall in 
Iosephus;
 witness when he saith of King 
Iehoja∣chin,


c
 
, 
being just and mercifull,
 of whom the Scripture

 once and
 again reporteth, 
and he did that which was evill in the sight of the
Lord.


§ 2. A Cubit,
 say some, is the length from the elbow to the wrist;
say others, to the tip of the longest finger: some making it the fourth,
others the sixth part of a man. Some allowing it a foot, others a foot
and half, with whom we concurre. But it is mainly materiall, that the
Cubits of the Temple were
 
after the first measure;
 that is, according to
those whereby the Ark was framed, before mens first strength and
stature was abated. For as it is hard exactly to define how big men were


in former ages: so it plainly appears, both by Scripture and Pagan Testi∣monies,
how much mens might is impaired, and falls short of the per∣formances
of the ancients.

Homer, Iliad. E▪
 in the duell betwixt 
Diomedes
 and 
Aeneas.
—


.—
 
Virgil, Aeneid.
 12. in the fight betwixt, 
Aeneas
 and 
Turnus.
 
Vix saxum lecti bi
 sex cervice subirent,


Qualia nūc hominū producit corpora tellus.



A stone he snatch'd and threw, a stone indeed


So huge▪ so heavy, two men now had need


To heave it up, such dwarfes our days doe breed.


However we may safely with the most moderate, make the Cubit 
of the
first measure
 double to the former, and equall to our English yard.


§ 3. Say not that this allowing of severall Cubits amongst the 
Iews

was double dealing,
 and a flat breach of that Commandement,
 
Thou shalt▪
not have in thy bag diverse weights, a great and a small.
 For that ordinance one∣ly
forbad the abuse of one measure, 
a great
 to buy, and 
a small
 to sell
with, both being conceived of the same standard. But to have severall
weights or measures, where the chapman is acquainted with the diffe∣rence,
and the prices rated accordingly, is neither fault nor fraud at all,
no more then for a Merchant to sell by two severall pound weights, the
one 
Troy,
 the other 
Averdupois,
 where the differences of the ounces is no∣toriously known.


§ 4. But thus allowing the Temple to be sixty great Cubits,
 or as
many yards, or ninescore feet, long; twenty great Cubits, or yards, or
sixty foot, broad; thirty great Cubits, or yards, or ninety foot, high; (all
clearly within the house, besides the breadth of the wal without) yet some
wil say it answered not expectation, and the stately character given therof
in Scripture. Is this that Fabrick which filled the whole world with the
fame thereof, which was so small in it self considered? Nothing can be

magnificum,
 which is not 
magnum,
 and it must first be 
great,
 before it can
be 
glorious.
 He may be 
pretty,
 but not a 
proper
 person, who hath not
bulk proportionable to his beauty. Yea if 
Solomons
 Temple were com∣pared
to some structures and Fanes of heathen Gods (as humane Au∣thors
give in their dimensions) it would appear as Saint 
Gregories
 to
Saint 
Pauls,
 (the babe by the mothers side) or rather this 
Davids
 modell
would be like 
David
 himself standing by 
Goliah,
 so gigantick were some
Pagan Fabrickes in comparison thereof. Indeed this Temple is termed

exceeding magnificall 1 Chron.
 22. 5. But 
Diana
 who is styled 
her magnifi∣cence,
Act.
 19. 27. seems better to deserve the title, whose Temple is
 said
to be four hundred and twenty feet in the length, two hundred and
twenty in the breadth,
 and sixty in the height thereof.


§ 5. To which we answer. 1
t
. The state of 
Solomons
 Temple did


principally consist not so much in the greatness, as exquisite symmetry
thereof, and costly furniture therein. 2. It was abundantly big enough
for the use for which it was intended, namely to contain the holy ves∣sells
(with sufficient, yea with large space betwixt them) and to receive
such Priests as did officiate therein. For the 
Holy of Holies
 was accessible
to the high-Priest alone, and that but once a year, and into the 
Holy
 or 
in∣ward
house
 came not all the many thousands of 
Levites,
 but onely such
Priests (to light lampes, set shew-bread, offer incense) as by 
Lot
 and

course
 were called thereunto, as appeareth by 
Zacharies
 sole staying there∣in,
whilest 
the whole
 
multitude of the people were praying without.
 Indeed no∣thing
of drudgery was done in the Temple, or what must require many
men to manage it, it being neither handsome nor healthfull to croud
much company into a covered room in that hot Countrey. Lastly, the
great latitude and capacity of the Temple consisted in the outward
Courts, unseparable parts thereof of such receipt, as to entertain multi∣tudes
of men 
sub dio,
 in the open aire, as compleating a square of five
hundred cubits, and in the amplitude, largeness and magnificence there∣of,
equalling, yea exceeding the greatest buildings in the world, if report
be but reduced to the standard of truth, and travellers not permitted to

slip their thumb
 in their measuring of yards, overlashing in their relations.


§ 6. To return to what properly is termed Temple,
 the 
Tectum,
 or
covered part thereof. It was more then twice as great as the Tabernacle
made by 
Moses,
 which (as
 
Ribera
 collects from the length of the cur∣tains

Exod.
 26.) was but thirty Cubits in length, ten in breadth, and as
many in height. Yea, well might the Temple exceed the Tabernacle in
dimensions, if we consider; First, the 
Tabernacle
 was erected by exiles
wandering in a barren wilderness; the 
Temple
 by a potent Prince, and
his populous subjects in their own peaceable countrey. Secondly, the

Tabernacle
 was in a manner fitted for its foundation, to the backs and
shoulders of the 
Levites,
 which were to carry it, and therefore might
not exceed a portable proportion. Thirdly, the 
Temple
 mystically ty∣pified
the Church Triumphant, and therefore in strength, state, grace,
and greatness was to surpass the Tabernacle, the moveable Emblem of
the Church Militant.


§ 7. Now how the structure of the Temple stood in relation to the
four quarters of the world, is not plainly expressed in Scripture,
 but may
partly be collected from the phrase used in the originall, where the
porch is said to be set 
 
before
 
the face of the house,
 where 
Before

is 
Eastward
 in the propriety of the Hebrew tongue. Hence all expositors,
Jewish and Christian, confidently place the ends or length of the
Temple East and West, the sides or breadth thereof North and South,
making the porch or entrance on the East end, the inward house in the
middle, and the 
Holy of Holies
 in the West end of the Temple, which se∣verall
parts we come now orderly to describe.








CHAP. IV. Of the fair Porch at the entrance of the Temple.


§ 1. THe Porch, in Latine 
porticus, & vestibulum,
 in Hebrew 
Ulam,

(which name the 
Septuagint
 retain) gave a stately entertainment
to such as entered into the Temple. In the 
book of
 Kings
 we
meet with the length, and breadth thereof, but no height there menti∣oned:
In
 
Chronicles
 we finde the length and height of it, whilest there the
breadth is omitted; by putting both together we may spell the perfect
dimensions thereof. Thus, those who hope for exact intelligence from
heaven, must peruse, and compare all expresses dispatched thence. Yea, in
the new Testament, Gods message is whole, but not wholly by one mes∣senger,
so that, what is wanting in one, is supplied in another Evange∣list.
This Porch was twenty Cubits in
 length (according to the breadth
of the house) ten in breadth, and an hundred
 & twenty in height, moun∣ting
tower-like above the rest, being four times as high, as the body of
the Temple.


§ 2. Some will say with covetous 
Iudas,
 
To
 
what purpose was this wast?

seeing the inside thereof was but an useless vacuity, not having any bells
therein (trumpets being the onely bells of the Hebrews to summon
their assemblies) and that otherwise it was for no service. But know,
that is not empty, which is full of ornament; nor idle, which stands
both for strength, and state. If an elegant 
exordium
 be so usefull in an
oration, to gain the ears of the Auditors; no less gracefull a fair front
in a building, to win the eyes of the beholders. Nor was 
Solomon
 minded
like many in after-ages, who cut down all top-masts from the ship of
Christs Church (politickly pretending a tempest, and that all is done
for her safety) and make her close notted to the very keel; but, his large
hart and hand, cared not what he expended on the magnificence of Gods
House.


§ 3. Here I cannot but admire,
 to see legions
 of learned men, ex∣tend
and cary on the aforesaid height, of an hundred and twenty Cubits
(appropriated in the text to the porch alone) even to the whole fabrick
of the Temple, making the entire body thereof of an uniform height,
equall with the porch. Where, to excuse them from inconveniences,
they make the lower Temple to reach to the first loft, roof, or seeling of
Cedar, over which they fancy an upper house of equall propor∣tion,
the roof whereof ranged even with the porch in height; so ma∣king
a 
Duplicate,
 or all the rooms of the Temple to be double, one on
the floor, the other in the upper story. Indeed we read in 
Solomons
 song
of a sort of sheep
 
whereof every one bare twins,
 but that such gemination
was here in the Temple, is altogether improbable, Scripture being silent


of that second, or upper story, nor mentioning any use, for which it
was intended, and confining the height of the Temple to just thirty

 Cubits. Well therefore may we suspect some flaw, or crack in those
spectacles, which represent the Temple thus double, against the simpli∣city
of the text, to the unprejudiced readers thereof.


§ 4. To return to the porch;
 fair (no doubt) was the door or gate
leading thereinto, though very bold is the assertion of 
venerable Bede,


 affirming that it was so great, that, 
standing full east, the equinoctiall Sun
without any obstacle, did send his beams through the door of the Temple, and Oracle,
into the very Ark which was within the Holy of Holies.
 But, grant the gate ve∣ry
great in the porch, surely the sun-shine could not penetrate so far, be∣ing
intercepted by the partition. It being improbable, that the door of
the Oracle was ever left open, that mysterious place being unenterable,
as well for the eyes, as feet of any, save the high-Priest alone. Otherwise,
needless was the renting of the 
vail
 at our Saviours passion,
 if the passage
into the 
Holy of Holies
 was pervious at all times, or if the gate thereof did
usually stand open.


§ 5.
 This porch (as the words lay plain in the text) 
Solomon
 overlaid
within with pure gold.
 However interpreters expound these words (though
next in position to the porch) rather to reach over in their relation, to
other more inward parts of the Temple, conceiving it too vast and
needless an expence, to overlay a tower six score Cubits high within
with gold. But, ill fare 
covetous Commentatours
 on a 
liberall text.
Solomon
 will give them small thanks for their great thrift; to spare his
cost, and at once to spoile both the letter of the text, and the lustre of his
Temple. We conclude it overlaid with pure gold, that is, gilded all over,
but being silver within; so reconciling it to another place, where 
Da∣vid

is said to have provided
 
seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay
the walls of the houses withall.
 Thus it took the denomination of gold, from
that metall which was most precious, and most visible on the surface
thereof.


§ 6. Let none here condemn me, for grudging the Temple her glory,
thus debasing the gold thereof into silver-gilt. For mine own part, as

Moses
 wished 
all Gods people
 Prophets;
 it would not offend me, if all
Gods House were 
pearles,
 mine eyes are not so bleared with envy, as to
smart at the shining of 
Solomons
 Temple. But a due decorum must be
observed in this edifice, and one place of Scripture must not be advan∣ced,
to depress another. And, seeing there were degrees in holiness,
why not also gradations in gallantry, between the severall rooms of the
Temple? So that all three might be overlaid with 
pure gold;
 the 
porch

with leafe, the 
inward house
 with plate, the 
Holy of Holies
 with the most
refined gold of 
Parvaim.








CHAP. V. Of the Holy, or outward Temple.


§ 1. WE advance now from the Porch into the next room,
 called

 
Hechal
 the 
Temple,
 (because the largest part thereof)
as also 
 
the greater
 
house,
 by 
Tremellius templum
anterius,
 by others 
interior domus, the inward-house,
 (namely in respect of the
porch) which had forty
 Cubits in the length, while the breadth and
height thereof, was adequate to the generall dimensions of the Temple.


§ 2. The foundation of this Temple (as of the whole structure)
consisted of 
great costly hewed stones,
 brought thither by the Kings
 com∣mand.
Here if the vulgar Latine hath 
Lapides pretiosos,
 we must not un∣derstand
gems and jewels thereby; for, the burying of such shining
beauties under ground, what had it been else, but the 
putting of a candle
under a bushell?
 Besides, such are by nature too small for that service, and
it was the prerogative royall of the new 
Ierusalem,
 which came down
from heaven, to have 
the foundation of that City
 
garnished with all manner of
pretious stones.
 Conceive them here stones of price, on whose polishing
much cost was expended to make them no less fair to 
ight, then firme
for substance. For, 
Solomon,
 who built not for ostentation, but true mag∣nificence,
did not worship God onely with 
eye-service;
 but was care∣full,
that the under-ground work of the Temple should be as well spe∣cious,
as strong; knowing, that the same God saw both the secret of
his heart, and bottome of his house. To lesson us in our spirituall edi∣fices,

 
to lay up in store for our selves a good foundation against the time to come, that
we may lay hold on eternall life.


§ 3. How thick the walls of the Temple were,
 is not expressed in
Scripture. 
Villalpandus
 out of 
Ezekiel
 colle
teth the breadth of the wall to
be six Cubits,
 but how truely, I will not determine; whilest 
Peter Co∣mestor,

without giving any reason, makes the wa
en Cubits thick; more,
I beleeve, then an Architect will allow proportionable; not to say, how
many quarries of stone so much solid wall would superfluously devou
e.
We are well assured (though insisting on no 
et measure) it was built
most substantiall of it self (had not the sins of the people infeebled it)
with breadth suitable to such an height, to which it was to be raised, and
such a burden, which it was to support.


§ 4. This wall had the out-side thereof made of 
stone,
 for 
strength;

the middle of 
Cedar,
 for 
beauty;
 the in-side of 
gold,
 for 
magnificence.

The Cedar was so curiously carved with imagery of 
flowers,
 
Palmes,
 and

Cherubims,
 that the walls of this house seemed at the same time, a Garden
of flowers, a Grove of trees, yea and a Paradise of Angels. Nor was all
this 
flowretry,
 and other celature on the Cedar, lost labour, because


concealed, when covered with gold. Indeed, had such graving been
either 
in-laid,
 or 
flat-work,
 the superinduction of the gold had hid it,
from any to behold it; but those figures being outwardly imbossed
with visible prominencies, the plate of the purest and most flexible me∣tall,
applyed it self so close to each lineament in the sculpture, that it set
off, and expressed the carved work with advantage, abating nothing of
the cunning, and adding much to the cost thereof.


§ 5.
 But being here to enquire into the forms of these 
Cherubims,
 I
am utterly dishea
tened with that passage in 
Iosephus
 speaking of their
shapes, 
, 
none can conceive or express
what kind of creatures they were.
 Notwithstanding, many learned men are
very peremptory in assigning their shapes, but no more agreeing in their
severall opinions, then 
Men, Women, Children, Lions, Eagles, Oxen,
 are one
like to another. In all which forms I finde 
Cherubims
 represented by se∣verall
Authours, grounding them on the vision in
 
Ezekiel.
 Haply they
assumed severall shapes, not always fixt to one figure, but preferring that
forme for the time being, which suited best with their present service.
Appearing, when sent to treat, 
Men;
 when to terrifie, 
Lions;
 when to
show strength, 
Oxen;
 when to use swiftness, 
Eagles.
 But for certainty
herein, the surest way, to know the fashion of these celestiall creatures, is
to live and dye in Gods fear and favour; and then, shall we not onely

see,
 but in some sort 
be Cherubims
 our selves, 
 
fellow-commoners with
Angels
 (as our
 Saviour saith) and sharers with them in glorious im∣mortality.


§ 6.
 Of the same curiosity for
 carving, were the two doors with
folding leaves, but made of fir-tree, and overlaid with gold, which lead
out of the porch into the Temple. The workmanship of these doors,
and of the wall being in all particulars so like, that when they were shut,
no breach or interruption appeared in the graving, but a fair continuati∣on
thereof. Posts of olive-tree
 four-square were made for those doors
to turn upon.


§ 7.
 The floor hereof was made of boards
 of fir (onely as stifning
in the middle) and they were faced and lined with gold on both sides.
So soundeth the text to the plain reader thereof,
 
and the floor of the house
he overlaid with gold within and without.
 But 
Tremellius
 expoundeth this

within and without,
 not, 
above
 and 
beneath
 the boards (theseeming sense of the
words) but, 
tam in adyto quàm in templo,
 both 
within the Oracle,
 as also 
without,

in this Temple or great house.


§ 8. Some will say,
 this was not so proper, that the pavement of the
house should be as rich as the roof thereof. But this must be imputed to
the poverty of nature, not affording more precious metal, seeing worse the
gold was too bad for the floor, and better could not be had for the roof.
Yet the foresaid pavement though of gold must be presumed plain,
without any carving, otherwise the inequality of the sculpture had ren∣dered


it uneasie to be walked upon. Here the Priests feet were taught to
trample on worldly wealth; and surely, one meanes to move God to

 
tread Satan under our feet,
 is to make a foot-stool of this 
temporall Mammon,

being one of his principall baites, and most pernicious temptations.


§ 9. Windows were also made in the Temple, but how many,
 is not
exactly specified. The fewer would serve the turn, because of the abun∣dance
of artificiall lamps constantly burning therein. Indeed, some
competent darkness raiseth devotion; for, though that
 
unapproachable
light which no meer man hath or can see,
 doth heighten, and elevate the zeal of
glorified Saints admitted thereunto, yet too much outward light draw∣eth
out devotion too thin, and scatters it in the eyes, whilest a solemn
darkness remands it to the heart with greater veneration. And a dark
Oratory (being as it were a room hung with black against a funerall)
doth minde such as enter therein of mortification.


§ 10. These windows come under a threefold enquiry.
 1. How
fashioned. 2. Whereof made. 3. Where placed. For their fashion,
the originall termeth them 
Secuphim athumin,
 words so variously rendered
by Translatours, that the windows which should lighten the fabrick,
are themselves the most dark and difficult to be understood. We stick
to our last translation of 
narrow lights;
 a form found advantageous, as
most thrifty to collect (tunnel-like) most light from without, so most
liberall to dispense it within with greatest conveniency. For their mat∣ter,

Rabbi Iehuda
 an ancient writer (whose judgement 
Tremellius
 pre∣ferreth

 above all others) conceiveth them of 
glass,
 plenty whereof we
have observed nigh 
Sidon,
 in purity corrivall with Crystall it self. But

 Saint 
Hierome
 will have them 
lattised, Lignis interrasilibus, & vermiculatis,

with 
worming or winding splinters of shaved wood:
 in which notion the Sep∣tuagint
renders them 
 
windows of net work.
 If so, we will
be bold to conceive such wooden lathes were overlaid with gold, other∣wise
it was unsuitable, that when no wood appeared on the walls, it
should presume to peep out in the windows. Sure I am, in the second
Temple (inferiour to this in magnificence) 
Iosephus
 reports, how a
Roman soldier set fire on a 
golden
 window. However, if one will main∣tain,
that these windows, made as much to let in aire, as light, and (per∣chance)
more to let out smoak then either (caused by the constant lamps
and perfumes) were open without any shutting at all, I see no coercive
argument, to enforce his beliefe to the contrary, can be taken out of
Scripture. Now because the Temple was compassed about with three
stories of chambers, each of them, five, and all three, fifteen Cubits high,
these windows in the Temple must be made above the roof of those
chambers, where their high standing afforded a double benefit, both of
clearer light, and greater privacy.


§ 11. The roof of the Temple,
 finding no exception to the contrary,
probably was flat, built like other houses in 
Iudea,
 where men might


walk upon them;
 
Preach you
 (saith our Saviour) 
on the house tops.
 But,
if any aske, with what metall it was covered? I am not ashamed to pro∣fess
my ignorance. A quere, which, by his own confession,
 posed

Villalpandus,
 propounded unto him by 
Isabella
 Archduchess of 
Austria,

even after he had studied the subject many years, and accounted himself
question-proof in all particulars. Insomuch, that 
non-plussed
 hereat, he
was fain afresh to betake himself to his book, and on second enquiries
found out of 
Eupolemus,
 and other Authors (Scripture being silent there∣in)
that it was covered with tiles of brass (no more contradiction, then

 
hornes of Iron
 mentioned in Scripture) which, 
squammato opere,
 in 
scale∣work,

lay one over another. A thing not unlikely in it self, 
David
 having
provided brass in such abundance, that it was
 
without weight.
 No won∣der,
when we read that in 
Meldorpe
 a small City of 
Dithmars
 in 
Denmark

the ordinary inhabitants therein cover their houses with
 copper. This
I dare negatively affirme, it was not covered with lead, being so drossie
and impure a metall, that not one ounce thereof is mentioned to be used
about all the Temple.






CHAP. VI. Of the Holy of Holies.


§ 1. THis is called the 
Oracle,
 in Hebrew 
Debir, Gods Parliament-house,

or, 
speaking place,
 also the 
Holy of Holies,
 or, 
the inner-house.
 It
was in fashion four-square, the height, length, and breadth
thereof equally extending to
 twenty Cubits. To shew the stability,
and firmness of happiness: so that, place the roof where the floor was,
exchange one side-wall for the other, 
Cube-like
 it still continued the same
firme proportion.
 Nor is the allusion of Saint 
Gregory
 to be contemned,
on the like occasion observing, that so much as the soul ascends in know∣ledge
of God, so much it extends in love to his neighbour; both which
meeting together make a square-well-grown, and proportionable
Christian. Of the same form, but far less, was the 
Holy of Holiest
 in the
Tabernacle, namely ten
 Cubits square verifying our observation, that
the Temple was the Tabernacle printed in a greater character.


§ 2. Some will demand of me,
 that seeing the Temple was thirty
Cubits, and this 
Holy of Holies
 but twenty Cubits high, what then be∣came
of the remaining ten Cubits, reaching up to the roof of the Temple?
I answer in the words of 
Elisha
 in another case,
 
The Lord hath hid it from
me, and hath not told me.
 For the main we may be confident, that seeing
Christ commanded the fragments of the multiplyed loaves to be bas∣ketted
up, 
that
 
nothing be lost,
 surely no rag of room, no snip, or shred of
empty space cut off from the squareness of the Oracle, was cast away as
needless, but was used for some sacred service, though the particular
employment thereof appears not in Scripture.



§ 3. It is stifly can vassed by learned men,
 whether any windows were
in this 
Oracle;
 and topicall arguments are produced on both sides.



For the Negative.


1 Windows
 were useless therein, which was
entered into but once a year.


2 The Cherubims overshadowed the 
Mer∣cy-seat,

shewing thereby these myste∣ries
were intended not for sight, but
secrecy.


3 
This
 Oracle 
was designed for a
 little
heaven, 
wherein
 They need no
 candle
nor light of the Sun, for the Lord God gi∣veth
them light.


4 It was exposed to the west, or setting
Sun, whose declining beams were im∣proper
for that place being the emblem
of perfection.




For the A
irmative.


1 A totall darkness had made it rather the
Truth of a dung
on, then Type of heaven.


2 The
 text placeth these windows not in the

Hechal,
 but 
Ha-baith
 or 
House,
 which pro∣perly
compriseth all the structure of the
Temple.


3 Uniformity to the rest of the fabrick requi∣red,
that the windows in the Oracle should
be correspondent to those in the outward
house.


4 S.
 
Hierome
 is positive, that on three sides.
South, North, and West, windows were
made, only denieth any in the East, or Porch
of the Temple, where the door supplied the want thereof.



But leaving the Reader to the liberty of his own opinion, I conceive
them too cruell, who serve the 
Oracle,
 as the 
Philistims
 did
 
Samson, put∣ting
out the eyes
 thereof, to which some necessary light in probability must
be allowed, and that the high Priest therein did not annually officiate
with 
blinde obedience.


§ 4. But grant the windows doubtfull, certain it is,
 that a most mag∣nificent
door of olive-tree was made out of the 
greater house
 into the 
Ora∣cle,

carved with Cherubims, and overlaid with gold, the lintell and side∣posts
thereof being five square, of the same matter and metall. As for
the Cherubims of massie gold, with their severall dimensions, hereof
more hereafter, in the description of the Utensils of the Temple.


§ 5. The floor was covered with boards of Cedar,
 overlaid with gold.
But whether or no, the precious stones, wherewith this house was

 garnished, were disposed in the pavement, or elsewhere in the walls, or
roof, we are as uncertain, as we are confident those precious stones were
exposed to view, and not covered (as the rest) under the gold of
 
Par∣vaim;

which some, from the affinity of the word, conceive 
Peru,
 or

Peruana.
 But, we will not be over curious in seeking for the Countrey,
which should we discover, all the misers of our modern age, would
presently flock thither, to fraught themselves with wealth. Nor is it any
absurdity, to conceive, 
Parvaim
 might be a Countrey now altogether
unknown, where God broached a rich vein of gold for this par
icular
purpose; and, the structure of the Temple once ended, stopped it up a∣gain,
that no other should tast thereof ever after.


§ 6.
 The weight of the nailes used in this room was fifty
 shekels of
gold, which 
Ribera
 understands not collectively of them all (the most
seeming sense of the text) but, that each of them severally weighed so
much. I dare not say, that 
Solomon
 particularly reflected on them, in that
his expression, 
The words of the wise are as goads, and as
 
nailes fastened by the
Masters of the assemblies.
 But here the quere will be, how could they be of


pure gold, seeing nailes of such refined metall will not 
drive,
 but 
flat,
 be∣cause
of the extraordinary softness, and pliableness thereof? It is answe∣red,
either they were rivetted into holes fore-prepared of purpose, or
else they were stifned with some mixture of silver, or copper, not for
cheapness, but the greater usefulness thereof. Be it here once for all ob∣served,
that, where the Utensils of the Temple, are termed of pure gold,
understand it so pure, as the end, for which they were intended, would
permit. Otherwise some necessary allay of baser metall made them not
onely serviceable for, but more durable in that purpose, for which they
were imployed.


§ 7. A stately Vaile was used as a traverse,
 cross the 
Holy of Holies,
 which

Solomon
 made
 of 
blew, and purple, and crimson, and fine linnen, and wrought
Cherubims thereon.
 If any demand why 
Solomon
 did not rather make use of
that vaile of like
 workmanship, which 
Moses
 had made by Gods di∣rection,
then put himself to the pain, and expence of a new one? Let
them know, that the former vaile fitted for the 
Sanctum Sanctorum
 in the
Tabernacle, was too short and narrow, yea, half in half too little for this
purpose. Therefore, it not being princely to piece, patch, or eek the
same, another was contrived, as indeed nothing at the second hand was
suitable to so stately a fabrick, wherein (as the Apostle in another case)

 
Old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.
 But more hereof
hereafter in the Utensils of the Temple.


§ 8. One difficulty remains,
 where this 
Holy of Holies
 was placed, be∣cause
the text
 saith 
 
he prepared it, in medio domus, in the midst of the
house,
 which seems to import, that the house or Temple did inviron, or en∣compass
it, and that the Oracle, like the center, was surrounded with the
circumference of the Temple: But on stricter enquiry, it will be found
onely a pure Hebraism, & that 
in the midst
 signifieth the same with 
within,

as it is judiciously rendered in our translation. Thus saith 
David,
 
He that
worketh deceit shall not live in the midst of my house,
 that is, shall not dwell with∣in
my family. 
O Lord,
 saith the Prophet, 
Revive thy work in the midst of the
years, in the midst of the years make known.
 Not insisting therein on an exact
middle, but desiring it might be done, onely within the time, and tearm
appointed, and promised by the Prophet. So also was the 
Oracle
 prepa∣red

in the midst of the house,
 that is, within the same, as the Chancell is said
to be 
within the Church,
 through which the high and usuall way leadeth
into it.






CHAP. VII. Of the Chambers about the Temple.


§ 1. ALthough it be repeated thrice in one
 verse,
 that chambers were
built 
round about,
 yet because in the same place, mention onely
is made of the 
Temple
 and 
Oracle,
 we conceive with learned 
Ribera,
 that


the east end where the Porch stood, was clear, and un-chambered, having
no other buildings about it, to hinder the prospect thereof. Nor, let
any be moved, because that the chambers are said to be built 
 
upon
the wall,
 as if they were founded on the wall of the temple, 
supra
 being
there taken for 
juxta,
 or 
contra, upon;
 or 
hard by,
 or 
over against,
 as our trans∣lation
rendreth it. Thus it is in the originall,
 
Upon the waters of Baby∣lon
we sat down and wept,
 that is, 
by the waters;
 as these chambers were built
hard by, or leaning to the wall of the Temple.


§ 2. Three rows there were of these chambers. In the lowest,
 each
chamber
 was five; in the middle, six; in the third, and highest story,
seven cubits broad; and each of them equally
 five cubits in height, go∣ing
up from the first to the middle, thence to the highest story with 
win∣ding
staires.
 The beams of these chambers did not lye in, but
 rest on the
wall of the Temple, the reduction or abatement whereof, narrowing
in, the higher it went, afforded fit stays for that purpose. It seems, the
beams were not mortised into the walls of the Temple, because the in∣tireness
of that building was not to be wounded with holes, and per∣forations,
which in process of time might fret in, and indent into the
structure it self. Speciall care therefore was taken, to preserve the whole∣ness
and prevent all fractions in this fabrick, in some relation to the
Temple of Christs body, whereof 
a bone was not to be broken.


§ 3. It is not expressed in Scripture,
 for what use these chambers were
principally intended. Some conceive them designed for galleries, or
walking-places; which to me seems too much presumption, for any to
take their pleasure so near the holy place. Others will have them used
for Dormitories, for such Priests to lodge in, who were in ordinary at∣tendance
about the Temple. For my own part, I conceive them imploy∣ed
for Repositories, wherein the holy vestments, and vessels were safely
laid up, together with those of the Tabernacle, which (though not used)
were here carefully preserved. For, first, the vessels of 
Moses
 his making
were not aliened, or diverted to any profane service; such sacriledge be∣ing
unsupposable in that age. Secondly, they were not altered, or melted
by 
Solomon
 (of moe and lesser, so to make fewer, and greater Utensils for
the Temple) because, the making, as well as the matter; the shape, as
well as the substance of all the Tabernacle-vessels were of 
livine institution.

Thirdly, they were not imployed in Gods service, because (some few
excepted, whereof hereafter) being calculated for the 
Meridian
 of the Ta∣bernacle
a less fabrick, thus fel out to be too short, and smal in proportion
to the Temple, as in the Vail was formerly observed. Seeing therfore they
were neither aliened, altered, nor used, it remaineth they were carefully
kept in these chambers, intimated in the text,
 where after the finishing
of the Temple, the 
Levites
 are said to bring up into it, 
all the vessels of the Ta∣bernacle.

Thus graces acquired or infused into a Christian in this life, are
not lost, forfeited, or cast away after death; but, preserved▪ perfected, and
swallowed up in glory.



§ 4. As for the mysticall meaning of these chambers;
 
Bede,
 no doubt,
thought he hit the very mark, when finding therein the three conditi∣ons
of life all belonging to Gods Church. In the ground-chamber, such
as live in mariage; in the middle-chamber, such as contain; but, in the

excelsis
 or third-story, such as have attained to the sublimity of perpe∣tuall
virginity. 
Rupertus,
 in the lowest chamber, lodgeth those of practi∣call
lives with 
Noah;
 in the middle, those of mixt lives with 
Iob;
 and in the
highest, such as spend their days with 
Daniel
 in holy speculations. But is
not this rather 
lusus,
 then 
allusio,
 sporting with, then expounding of Scrip∣tures?
Thus when the gates of the Oracle are made
 
five-square, Ribera

therein reads our conquest over the five senses; and when those of the
door of the Temple are said to be 
four-square,
 therein saith he is denoted
the 
quaternion
 of Evangelists. After this rate, 
Hiram
 (though, no doubt,
dexterous in his art) could not so soon fit a pillar with a fashion, as a
Frier can fit that fashion with a mystery. If made three-square, then the
Trinity of Persons; four-square, the cardinall vertues; five-square, the

Moses;

Beatitudes;

morall vertues; twelve-square, the articles of the Creed are therein con∣tained.
In a word, for matter of numbers, fancy is never at a loss, like a
begger never out of his way, but hath some haunts where to repose it
self. But, such as in expounding of Scripture reap more then God did
sow there, never eat what they reap thence, because such grainless huskes,
when seriously threshed out, vanish all into chaffe.


§ 5. For the rest, we refer the reader unto our Map, wherein he may
observe 
a double Alphabet
 for his direction. One of 
Roman letters,
 presenting
onely such things in the building of the Temple, as are infallibly foun∣ded
on the words of the text. The other of 
Italian,
 relating to such addi∣tions,
which, to compleat this fabrick, are taken out of Traditions, Rab∣bins,
Fathers, and learned mens conjectures. We thought it unfit, to con∣found
these together in the same character, being so distanced in their
own natures. The Apostle Saint 
Paul
 varies his phrase, when delivering
his prudentiall advises, from his style, when enjoyning, what he had
from divine inspiration. In the former, 
To the rest
 
speak I, not the Lord:
 In
the latter,
 
I command, yet not I, but the Lord.
 It had therefore been impu∣dent
presumption in us, not to have observed a difference in this our de∣scription,
betwixt immediate divine dictates, and humane (probable,
but fallible) collections.


Here the Map of 
Solomons
 Courts is to be inserted.




















THE
COURTS and UTENSILS
OF
SOLOMONS TEMPLE.




CHAP. I. Of the Court of the Priests.


§ 1. 
S
O much for the Diamond it self,
 
the covered Tem∣ple,

come we now to the Ring wherein it was
set, the Courts which encompassed it. Herein
we meet with much difficulty, arising partly
from Gods silence, (speaking little in Scripture of
the present subject) partly from mansloquacity,
whose fancies without warrant from the word,
are as copious as different in describing the Courts of this Temple. But,
that which makes the matter in hand more intricate is, because learned
men confound 
Temples
 and 
Times,
 ascribing those Courts to 
Solomons,

which onely belonged to the second Temple, at, and after the time of
our Saviour. Thus, as countrey painters make the 
nine Worthies
 (not ac∣cording
to the garb of those ancient ages wherein they lived) with bands
and cuffs according to our modern fashion; so some Jewish writers

(Iosephus
 himself being not wholly free from this fault) shape the Courts
of 
Solomons
 Temple, not after their true form in the old Testament; but
as the second Temple adorned by 
Herod,
 stood modelled in their own
days.


§ 2. We read of 
Iacob,
 that he set his own sheep three days
 journey
from the flocks of 
Laban
 his father-in-law, so sufficiently to distinguish
their severall stocks from making quarrels by meeting together. A
greater distance divides the two Temples, there being no less then seven∣ty
years, betwixt the destruction of the one, and erection of the other.
Enough in probability to prevent all mistakes, which might arise from



udling them together. I wonder therefore the more at their marvellous
agility, who so easily can leap over this 
great-gulfe
 of time, & who by con∣founding
the two Temples, and making many things common to both,
of two perfect models, compose one no better then a monster. That we
run not on the same rocks, we will carefully observe their severall pro∣perties,
insisting onely on such things for the present, as were peculiar to

Solomons
 fabrick, confining our selves to Scripture instructions: as
knowing that the judicious palat will prefer a drop of the 
sincere milk of
the word,
 before vessels full of 
Traditionary pottage,
 resenting of the 
wild gourd

of humane invention.


§ 3. A Court,
 in Latine 
Atrium,
 Greek 
, Hebrew 
 
Chatzer,
 ac∣cording to archi∣tecture
consist∣eth
of two prin∣cipall parts,



1 An open space in the middle (properly called 
ca∣vedium,
quasi cavum edium
) exposed to wind, and
weather.


2 A covert on the sides thereof (termed 
porticus
 and

) whither in heat, or rain, men might retreat,
for shade, or shelter, like the cloisters about the

Royal-Exchange
 in 
London.



This premised of the fashion of a Court in generall, 
Solomon
 made two
of them on the east of the Temple, one called 
 
chatzer happeni∣mith,

or, the 
inner
 
Court
 (in
 
Chronicles, the Court of the Priests) built with
three rowes of hewen stone, and a row of
 
Cedar beams.
 Understand three rows,
not 
collaterally
 in thickness, all abreast on the floor, and the Cedar for cei∣ling
within, (as 
Richardus
 will have it) but three 
subordinately
 in height,
one upon another, with Cedar beams (as lightest, and therefore upper∣most)
for a 
tarras
 on the top thereof. This is all that Scripture acquaints
us with, concerning the fabrick of 
the inner Court.
 For, that each row of
stone therein, was of a different colour, as 
Lyra
 affirmes, is but a fan∣cy
of his own. Such variation of colours I beleeve in 
Iosephs
 coat, and

Thamars
 garment, because Scripture hath affirmed it: not here, where
no warrant out of the word for such an assertion.


§ 4. Probably certain ascents led hither out of the outward Court,
and hence into the Temple. For,
 besides the frequent phrase 
of going up
into Gods house:
 it was proper that the Temple, as in holinesse, so in
height should be distanced above her Courts (as they one above ano∣ther,
and both above common ground) were it but to minde such as
approached thither, with the mounting of their bodies to elevate their
hearts in devotion. But, how many these stairs or steps were, is uncer∣tain,
though some will have them fifteen, according to the number of
the 
Psalmes of Degrees,
 sung, as they affirm, by the Priests in their ascent
to the Temple.


§ 5. This 
inner Court,
 or 
Court of the Priests,
 was proper onely for the
Priests to enter into. Yet probably the common people made a tumul∣
ous
incursion into it, when stoning 
Zachariah
 at the command of


King 
Ioash in the Court of the house of the Lord,
 even
 
betwixt the Temple
 
and the
Altar.
 As if the Antiperistasis of two eminent holy places on both sides
of them, had intended and emboldned their cruelty, and profaneness.
Wherefore, his last words, 
the Lord look upon it,
 
and require it,
 speake not
not so much revenge of his own death, as zeal to Gods honour, that he
would vindicate the profanation of so holy a place. This I conceive
one cause why the Prophet pointeth the Priests to this particular place,

to
 
weep betwixt the porch and the Altar,
 so by their sorrow to avert Gods
judgements from their nation, for this foul murder by their ancestours
committed therein.






CHAP. II. Of the great, or outward Court.


§ 1. WHereas 
Solomon
 is said to have made the 
Inner Court of the
House of the Lord;
 by the rule of relation, an outward
Court is thence next inferred. But to clear it more, ex∣press
mention is made thereof 2 
Chron.
 12. 9. where, besides the 
Court of
Priests,
 he is said to have made 
the great Court, and doors for the Court, and
overlaid the doors of them with brass.
 This Court in Hebrew is called 
Aza∣rah


, rendered by 
Montanus atrium auxilii,
 from 
Azar to help,
 because God
there answered his peoples prayer by his 
gracious assistance
 afforded unto
them.


§ 2. Well might this be termed the 
great Court,
 seeing large (though
uncertain) were the dimensions thereof, an hundred Cubits square at
the least. But what was this to contain all 
Israel
 therein? 
Philip
 speaking
of five thousand to be fed, 
Two
 
hundred penny worth of bread
 (saith he) 
is
not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.
 But, grant this Court two
hundred Cubits square (more then the place will allow) this would
afford but few inches for a mans body to stand in, except the ground
was here (as the loaves) miraculously multiplyed. We therefore con∣ceive,
that the people of the land were successively admitted to this place,
otherwise impossible to contain them. Ascents, or staires did also lead
into this Court, but how many is not known; surely they were low
and little, short and easie, to be climbed up, otherwise the cattell brought
thither to be sacrificed, could not conveniently clamber over them.


§ 3. This Court was by successive Kings (especially 
Hezekiah,
 who

 cased the pillars thereof with silver) improved to more beauty, then it
had in the days of 
Solomon.
 Some will say, this was a disparagement to
the perfection of 
Solomons
 work, as if he had left any defects, or defaults
therein, to be amended by others. Were not his structures, as his disco∣veries,
compleat? for,
 
Who is he that will come after the King in things?
 It
is answered, the outward Temple was, in the appendent Courts thereof,


capable of more cost and expence, to make them both bigger, and bra∣ver;
though the covered Temple was 
semel & semper, at once and for ever
perfected,
 afterwards admitting of no new addition, when 
Solomon
 had
finished it. Surely God granted not such a Monopoly to 
Solomon
 alone
to ingross all honour to himself, so that no reserve was left for posterity,
no bottome for their bounty to build on, in after ages, to testifie their
gratitude to Gods goodness. Some accessions therefore might be made
(though not to the vitall parts, as I may say) to the out-lims of the Tem∣ple.
It is the priviledge not of the house of God, but of God himself,
to be so perfect, as that nothing can be added unto him.


§ 4. But others will object,
 that this was a presumptuous innovation
in 
Hezekiah,
 seeing the Courts of the Temple, and all things therein
were framed according to the divine
 pattern 
David
 left to 
Solomon,
 for
him to overlay those pillars with silver, which 
Solomons
 wisdome, fol∣lowing
Gods platform, was pleased to make plain. But, let such know,
that he swerveth not at all from the proportion of the Copy, who onely
gilds, or colours the letters therein. 
Hezekiah
 for the main kept himself
to the former fabrick, not altering, but adorning the same. The worst
was, that afterwards he
 cut off the silver again to purchase the favour
of 
Sennacherib.
 Better had those pillars been left naked, then thus to be
clothed, and then to be stript of their costly coats. For, though (as some
scornfully may scoff) there was no danger of their catching cold when
thus disrobed; yet the beauty of those pillars were thereby much im∣paired,
looking ruggedly when again uncased, besides the inexcusable
sacriledge therein committed, whereof hereafter.


§ 5. We must not forget the 
entry,
 leading from this Court to the
Kings Palace, through which the Kings of 
Iudah
 had at pleasure a pri∣vate
passage into the Temple. This continuation of the Kings to Gods
house, shewed the mutuall intercourse which ought to be betwixt Poli∣cy,
and Piety; as also that Princes (besides their set, solemn, and pub∣lick
addresses to God by prayer) must have their secret recourses unto
him, in their occasionall devotions. It was first made by King 
Solomon,

and then so stately a structure, that amongst other things, the Queen of

Sheba
 was ravished with admiration at the sight thereof, when she be∣held


the ascent by which he went up into the house of the Lord.
 And yet after∣wards
it was made more magnificent, when
 
terrased
 on both sides with

 
Pillasters
 made of those 
Almuggin
 trees which she presented to 
Solomon;

which, if oderiferous, (as some will have it) made that passage as sweet to
the smell, as specious to the sight. Wicked 
Ahaz
 turned this 
entry
 from
the house of the Lord, 
for the King of Assyria,
 that is, as
 
Tremellius

will have it, stopped up, or diverted that passage, fearing, lest through
it the King of 
Assyria
 should out of the Temple suddenly surprise the
Kings palace. I conceive this done not for fear, but in favour of the

Assyrian
 King, 
Ahaz
 hereby cutting off all connexion, and dependence


of his Palace to the Temple, and utterly renouncing all relation to true
Religion, so the more to confirme this friendship with that heathen
King, begun on a new account, and grounded on pure principles of
Idolatry. At the same time he turned out also 
the
 
covert of the Sabbath

which they had built in the house, by which our foresaid Authour un∣derstands,
a place erected for the shelter of such Priests as officiated on
the Sabbath.


§ 6. As for their tradition,
 who report 
Solomon
 to have written on the
walls of the Temple, soveraign Receipts against all diseases, which 
He∣zekiah

afterwards is said to rase out, because people placed too much con∣fidence
therein, to the prejudice of divine providence, I listen to both as
Rabbinicall fables. Surely such medicines (if any there prescribed)
proved uneffectuall to cure 
Asa's
 gout, 
Ioram's
 dysentery, 
Uzziahs
 lepro∣sie,
as indeed no art can crave longer time, when death calls for the pre∣sent
payment of the debt to nature.






CHAP. III. Of the Gates and Porters of the Court.


§ 1. HEaven hath onely one,
 and that a
 narrow gate leading there∣into.
But severall fair gates on all sides, gave entrance into
the Courts of 
Solomons
 Temple. Some of them to us of cer∣tain,
others but of conjecturall situation. Of the former were,



1 
East-gate,
 where
 
Shelemiah
 was Porter. This gate was set in the
front, leading directly to the Temple, and therefore King 
Io∣tham


 rebuilt it, mounting Monarch-like above the parity of
other ports, that it became higher then all the rest, yet met with
no zelot to humble it, for aspiring above its fellows.


2 
North-gate,
 where
 
Zacharias
 his son was Porter.


3 
South-gate,
 attended on by the sons of
 
Obed-Edom.
 The 
house of
Asuppim
 (rendred by 
Hierome
 and 
Pagnine
 a 
counsel-house,
 by 
Tre∣mellius
Aerarium,
 the 
Treasury
) was for conveniency united to
their charge. A place, probably of entrance, certainly of conse∣quence,
as needing a constant guard about it.


4 
West-gate,
 where 
Shuppim
 and 
Hosah
 were Porters. To them al∣so
belonged the gate 
Shallecheth,
 by the 
causway of the going up,
 un∣derstand
thereby that stately ascent made by 
Solomon,
 out of his
own Palace into the Temple.



But besides these four, which respected the cardinall winds, we meet
with other intermediate gates, whose accurate position is uncertain.
Never did the blinded
 
Sodomites
 more groap for 
Lots
 door in the dark,
then learned men are puzled to finde the gate of
 
Sur,
 (elsewhere
 cal∣led


the 
foundation-gate
) where at the coronation of King 
Ioash,
 a tierce of

Levites
 were awarded to waite, by order from 
Iehojada. Tremellius
 not
improbably conceives it the same with the 
East-gate.
 As for the 
New∣gate


, wherein 
Baruch
 publickly read the book of 
Ieremy,
 I am confident
it was one of the four principall gates, onely repaired, enlarged, or ad∣orned
with new buildings.
 
Parbar
 seated on the west must not be
forgotten (whether Porters-lodge, Priests-vestry, or place wherein sa∣crificing
instruments were laid up) having something of the nature of
a gate therein, because two porters daily attended it. Say not, it was
suspicious, that so small a Court would run out at so many gates, which
surely were no more, then just proportion, and uniformity did re∣quire.


§ 2. The principall office of Porters was to secure the gates,
 provi∣ding
for the peace and purity of the Temple and service therein. These
in all were
 four thousand, thus daily disposed of; Eastward, six; North∣ward,
four; Southward, four; at 
Asuppim-gate,
 two; and two, West∣ward;
at the Causway, four; at 
Parbar-gate,
 two; four and twenty in
all. An eminent number in Temple-service (so many the singers
, and
the severall
 courses of the Priests) to which the four and twenty Elders
in the
 
Revelation
 have some allusion. Their service was, as well
nocturnall, as by day:
 
which by night stand in the house of the Lord.


§ 3. Here let others dispute,
 whether the Porters places were meerly
ministeriall, (or servile rather) or also partly judiciall, with some ad∣missive,
and exclusive power to take cognizance of the cleanness of
such persons as did approach to the Temple. Otherwise, they were
easily qualified for their office, rather bigness then brains commending
men generally to such imployments. Secondly, if they were intrusted
with any such authority, let others enquire, by what means they made
discoveries of peoples uncleanness, finding no oath 
Ex officio
 they ten∣dred
to any to betray themselves, though otherwise some secret polluti∣on
might be concealed, the parties themselves being onely privy there∣unto.
Lastly, let them discuss, whether these Porters were afterward
advanced to higher places, or onely (as the doors whereon they atten∣ded
turned round on their hinges) moved alternately in their own
sphere, without possibility of any farther preferment. If the latter, it is
strange that the worthy parts of 
Zachariah his son Porter Northward,
 com∣mended
in Scripture to be a
 
wise counsellour,
 should be imprisoned in so
narrow a profession. And yet his employment (though the meanest
about the Temple) was honourable in it self, if well executed: witness
holy 
David
 his choice, 
I had rather be
 a door-keeper in the house of my God, then
to dwell in the tabernacles of wickedness.


§ 4. Now notwithstanding all the care of the Porters to the contrary;
some (not going through the gates,
 but over the walls) made bold to
lodge and live with their whole families within the verge of the


Temple. 
Yea, the sparrow
 hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for her self,
where she may lay her young, even thine Altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my
God.
 By Altars understand the Courts and buildings about it, otherwise
the Altar it self (fitter for Salamanders then Sparrows) was too hot a
climate for their habitation. Birds, we see, may prescribe an ancient
title to build in our steeples, having time out of minde taken the same
priviledge in the Tabernacle, and Temple. Yea 
David
 in exile debarred
access to Gods publick service, doth pity his own, and prefer the con∣dition
of these fowls before him. And, although no devotion (whereof
they were uncapable) but the bare delight in fair fabricks, brought them
hither; yet, we may presume (according to their kind) they served
God better then many men in that place, chirping forth Morning and
Even-praises to the honour of their maker. To take our farewell of these
Porters, wicked 
Ahaz
 gave them a 
Supersedeas.
 from their office, in that
long 
Vacation
 wherein he
 shut up the doors of the house of the Lord,
so obstructing Gods mercy against himself.






CHAP. IV. Of the Chambers, and Treasuries about the Court.


§ 1. THe Porches,
 or Cloisters beneath were built with rooms a∣bove;
if not round about the Court, certainly over the in∣tervalls
of the gates. Such places were employed, partly for
chambers for Priests to lodge in, partly for Treasuries, wherein conse∣crated
things were deposited.


§ 2. Amongst the former,
 most remarkable was the chamber of 
Ge∣mariah

the son of 
Shaphan
 the Secretary, wherein
 
Baruch
 read the book
of 
Ieremy,
 which afterwards was burnt by 
Iehojakim
 King of 
Iudah.

When though some (dissenters and disswaders) amongst all the Cour∣tiers
no mourners appeared at the funeralls of this book, it being ex∣pected,
they should have been as cruell to their clothes, to
 rend them
for sorrow, at the sight of that double martyrdome of that innocent
Volume, first cancelled with a pen-knife to pieces, then afterward
burnt to ashes. But the flame, which did burn the book, did but bur∣nish
the truths written therein; Yea another 
Phoenix
 arose out of
the ashes thereof. 
Baruch
 transcribing another roul
 
with the same and
many like words added beside.
 Thus wanton children by breaking their
parents old rod, give them onely the occasion to make a better, and big∣ger
in the room thereof.


§ 3. Next we take notice of the chamber of 
Nathan
 Melech at the en∣tring
of the house of the Lord,
 by which stood those statues of horses dedi∣cated
to the Sun by some Idolatrous Kings of 
Iudah,
 which 
Iosiah
 de∣stroyed.


What! was the Sun, which
 
rejoyceth as a Giant to run his course,

ever so tyred, as to need hacknies to carry him to his journeys end? Oh
no, but the 
Iews
 plundred this piece of Idolatry from the 
Persians,
 who

 offered horses unto the Sun, and
 
Ovid
 renders some reason thereof,

Placat 
quo Persis radiis Hyperiona cinctum,


Ne detur celeri victima tarda Deo.


Horse to the beamed Sun's the Persians gift,


Slow sacrifice ill fits a God so swift.

Now the 
Iews
 counting it too gross Idolatry to sacrifice naturall horses
to the Sun, erected artificiall ones in honour thereof.


§ 4. Another eminent chamber,
 was that of the 
Sons of Hanan,
 which
was by the chamber of the Princes,
 probably on the one hand, 
which was by the
chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum the keeper of the door,
 on the other hand
thereof. Here 
Ieremy
 in vain solicited the 
Rechabites
 to drink wine, ob∣serving
the instructions of their ancestours therein; as also in their con∣stant
dwelling
 in tents, so to entertain all turnings of the times, with less
trouble to themselves. Provident birds, onely to perch on the boughs,
not build their nests on that tree, which they suspected would suddenly
be cut down, foreseeing perchance the captivity of 
Babylon.
 Indeed, in
all fickle times (such as we live in) it is folly to fix on any durable de∣sign,
as inconsistent with the uncertainty of our age, and safest to
pitch up 
tent-projects,
 whose alteration may with less loss, and a clear con∣science
comply with the change of the times.






CHAP. V. That Solomon made no moe then two Courts on the east of the Temple.


§ 1. ALthough many learned authours make four,
 and some moe
Courts about 
Solomons
 Temple, yet the following reasons per∣swade
me, that these two Courts formerly described by us,
were all which were of 
Solomons
 originall foundation. Because,



1 Mention is made of no moe in Scripture, either in the book of

Kings,
 or 
Chronicles,
 where his buildings are particularly described.


2 
Manasseh
 is said to have built Altars for the host of Heaven in the

two
 Courts
 of the house of the Lord. Probably, had there been
any moe, his profaneness would have found them out, no place
being priviledged from his Idolatry.


3 The narrowness of the place, as it was in 
Solomons
 time, admit∣ted
of no moe Courts, such was the precipice thereof on all sides.



This last is confessed by
 
Iosephus,
 whose words deserve our heeding to
clear the matter in hand; 
The Temple was built upon an
 
hard mountain, and
at the first, the plain on the top thereof was scarce sufficient to contain the Temple, and
the Altar, the
 circumference thereof being steep and shelving. But, when King
Solomon who built the Temple, had compassed the east part thereof with a wall, he


also placed a Porch upon the rampire, and so, many ages after it lay
 unfenced on the
other parts, untill the people every day bringing earth thither, at last made it plain and
large enough.
 Insomuch that the Temple extant in the days of 
Iosephus▪
 had
a threefold wall about it, and other courts built on that forced ground,
which industry had added thereunto. See here the small compass of the
Temples floor at the first founding thereof. So that those who in 
Solo∣mons

time make moe Courts about it, must build them in the aire, see∣ing
the earth (such then the scantness and steepness thereof) afforded
no bottome for the building of such imaginary fabricks.


§ 2. But shrewd objections
 are brought to the contrary,
 by such who,
in 
Solomons
 time, make moe then two Courts by us described. No doubt
(say they) he observed 
Davids
 instructions, who by the Spirit gave him
the pattern 
of
 
all the Courts of the house of the Lord, which he meant to make.

These therefore at the least must needs be three, seeing 
All
 (as
 
Aristotle

observes) can not in proper language, be predicated of a lower number.


§ 3. Answ. I confess the words so read in the vulgar Latine, 
& omnium
quae cogitaverat atriorum,
 though no such thing appears in our translation
founded on the originall, where 
David
 is said to deliver to 
Solomon
 the

 
pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, of the house of the Lord, of all the chambers
round about &c.
 This third Court therefore in 
Solomons
 time, was but
a groundless fancy.


§ 4. Object. Another Court must of necessity be allowed on the
west of the Temple,
 or else (which is altogether improbable) the 
Holy
of Holies
 lay open, unfenced, and common to the City.


§ 5. Answ. The same was sufficiently fenced, and severed from the
City with the precipice of the place, barring all access, and the Temple
on that side surrounded with ambient aire in the concavity of the vally.
If besides this, any artificiall wall encompassed the Temple on the west,
the distance between it and the Temple may be counted a passage, but a∣mounted
not to the spaciousness of a Court.


§ 6. Object. Good authours,
 
Bede, Cassidore, Comestor,
 and 
Tostatus

confidently adde, 
Atrium Foeminarum,
 or, the 
Womens Court,
 where their
sex severally by themselves attended their devotions. Nor is it probable
they were mingled with men, seeing the Prophet speaking of a solemn
humiliation, 
They shall waile
 (saith he) 
the family of the house of David apart,
and their
 wives apart, the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives
apart.


§ 7. Answ. This place cited out of 
Zachary
 was spoken after 
Solomons

Temple was demolished,
 and 
Zerubbabels
 erected. Such separation of
sexes in severall Courts in the 
first Temple
 hath no foundation in Scrip∣ture,
but rather thence the contrary may be collected, that all sexes and
ages promiscuously met together; for, 
Iehosaphat
 is said, 
to have stood in
the
 
house of the Lord with their little ones, their 
l
 wives, and their children.



However it may be that there was anciently a partition of the 
outward
Court per clathros & cancellos,
 with 
bar
 or 
lattise-work,
 into two parts, and so
the women (though in the same Court) might be severally by them∣selves.


§ 8. Object. There were moe Courts,
 three at least, in 
Ezekiels
 Tem∣ple;
which as 
Villalpandus
 will have it, in all particulars was the same
with 
Solomons.


§ 9. Answ.
 Confessing some generall conformities, we deny, not
onely the identity, but exact similitude betwixt them. It is against the
nature of a Prophecy to have a retrograde motion, to bring things back∣ward,
and raise the ghosts of buildings departed, which rather looks
forward, presenting things to come. 
Ezekiels
 Temple had not the same
body with 
Solomons,
 but greater, and moe were the parts, and members
thereof; as in due time, God willing, we shall make it to appear.


§ 10. Object.
 
Iosephus
 a learned 
Iew
 living in 
Ierusalem
 seems to
adde another,
 
Atrium Gentium,
 the 
Court of Gentiles,
 or unclean persons.


§ 11. Answ. The place quoted out of him to this purpose, will scarce
bear the collection of a new Court from it. However 
Iosephus
 was none
of those
 
aged men,
 who remembring the magnificence of 
Solomons,
wept when the foundation of the second Temple was laid before their eyes.
 I mean
he was no eye-witness of the first and old Temple (being born five
hundred years and more, after the dissolution thereof) and onely spake
of it, either by tradition, or conjecture, and therefore his authority of no
such strength, as to command our beliefe. Besides, he seems to have for∣gotten
what formerly we cited out of him, for the narrowness of the
place, not admitting moe Courts in 
Solomons
 time. However, his eyes
were so dazeled with long looking on the second Temple extant in his
age, that he conformeth thereto, and confoundeth therewith 
Solomons

Temple, if making any moe Courts then two therein.


§ 12. However, I dare not deny,
 but even this 
first Temple,
 after the
death of 
Solomon,
 might by succeeding Kings, have another Court added
thereunto; namely, when by art, industry, and great expense they had
raised up the valley, and gained more ground to 
the mountain of the house,

which was so small at the first. Hereof we finde a double insinuation
in Scripture:



1 One, when 
Iehosaphat
 is said to stand 
in the house of the Lord before
the new
 Court,
 which probably about his reign, was added to
the ancient fabrick.


2 Another, when at the coronation of 
Ioash Iehoiada
 gave order
that the Priests
 alone should come into the 
house of the Lord
 (meaning the inner-court thereby) whilest the people should be

in the Courts
 of the house of the Lord,
 the plural number there impor∣ting
two Courts at the least, at that time belonging to the Temple,
into which the common people had free access. But herein no∣thing
can be positively concluded.





Wherefore, as the sons of 
Barzillai,
 though Priests, yet because they found
not their genealogy reckoned in the
 Register, were therefore removed
from the priesthood, till one with 
Urim
 and 
Thummim,
 should arise to
decide the controversie: so we suspend this third and new Court, as
doubtfull, in our descriptions, untill some infallible Judge, on better evi∣dence
then we can produce, shall clear the title thereof.






CHAP. VI. Of the Pillars in the Porch of the Temple.


§ 1. GOd at the first creation,
 having finished the elements, and
essentiall parts of the world, did afterwards furnish them
with creatures suitable thereunto, no vacuity being left: so
that rather then any thing should be empty, any thing will fill it. 
Solomon

in like manner, having ended the main rooms of the Temple, in the
n
xt place made the furniture thereof, wherein every vessell was
pregnant with heavenly mysteries; so that what the Apostle saith of the
languages in the world
 
none of them are without signification,
 was true of
the smallest Uten
ill in the Temple, speaking much holy matter, had we
eares to hear, and hearts to understand it.


§ 2. We begin with the Porch,
 where the two great brazen pillars
were set up, each of them
 twelve Cubits in compass, (bearing a little
more then four Cubits in Diameter) four
 fingers thick of solid me∣tall,
and the rest hollow within, some difference appearing in the mea∣sure
of their height, variously presented unto us;

1 KING. 7. 15.
 
And he cast two Pillars of brass of eigh∣teen
Cubits high a piece.
2 CHRON. 3. 15.
 
Also he made before the house two Pillars
of thirty and five Cubits high.




1 To reconcile these, some have recourse to severall Cubits, 
common,

or 
great; of the first measure
 conceiving the former mentioned in

Kings;
 the latter (which were twice as big) intended in 
Chro∣nicles.


2 Others understand the bare shaft of the Pillars to be eighteen
Cubits high, besides the Chapiters above, and Basis beneath
them: the former being
 five Cubits, and the latter so many as
made the totall number thirty and five.


3 A third
 sort most probably conjecture, that in 
Chronicles
 the
height of both Pillars are counted together.



Where if any object, that eighteen and egihteen Cubits make thirty six,
one more then the number in 
Chronicles; Ribera
 conceives that so much
onely as appeared of these pillars are summed up, each of them having
half a Cub it of their shaft lost in their height, as running in, and hid in
his Chapiter grafted upon it.



§ 3. The chapiters of these pillars were curiously adorned with 
net∣work,

 chain-work,
 and 
rowes of pomegranats.
 These were but apples of brass,
whilest 
words spoken in due season
 are far more precious, being like those 
of
gold in pictures
 of silver.
 Lillies
 also were made on the top of these Cha∣piters,
wherein though 
Hiram
 might imitate the fashion of those
flowers, no art could counterfeit their colours, seeing he who set him on
work, even
 
Solomon himself in all his glory was not arayed like one of these.

These pillars set in the porch did not like those two in 
Dagons
 Temple
support the main fabrick thereof, nor was any burden born by them,
but were onely (like brazen Andirons in great mens chimnies) for
ornament. Let none say unto them as the master to the men in the
market place,
 
Why stand yee here all the day idle?
 seeing they were usefull in
their kind, and contributed much to the beauty of the Temple.


§ 4. Others will say, these pillars were ill placed, because obscured
in the porch, where few did behold them. His kindred said to our Savi∣our

 
There is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seek
th to be known
openly.
 Had 
Solomon
 for his credit intended to make the Temple appear glo∣rious,
he should not so privately have concealed these pillars in the Porch.

—Occultae non gratia magna columnae.

Better had they been set like the 
Colossus
 at 
Rhodes,
 or the two Columns
before Saint 
Markes
 in 
Venice, sub dio,
 in the open aire. But here we must
know, first, that 
Solomon
 intended his Temple, not so much to be seen, as
to be glorious. Secondly, the door leading into the Porch, being ex∣ceeding
broad, and high, these pillars were not wholly concealed, but a
great part, if not all of them, was exposed to publick view through the
door of the Porch.


§ 5. The Pillar
 standing on the right hand in the
 Porch was called

Iachin,
 that is, 
he will stablish;
 and the other on the left side 
Boaz,
 that is,

in him is strength.
 Pity without power will be but lame to help us;
Power without pity will be but deaf to hear us; whilest both together
make a comfortable composition. Both these pillars we finde in a
manner erected in the expression of the leper
 to our Saviour:

Iachin,
 but doubtfully and conditionally, 
Lord if thou wilt.


Boaz,
 positively and absolutely, 
Thou canst make me clean.

Both these pillars there set up, signified Gods protection of the place, and

the gates of hell
 could not prevail against that Temple, which had these
pillars in the Porch thereof.


§ 6. Besides this, in a secondary sense these two did resemble emi∣nent
Saints,
 Ministers especially (such as 
Iames, Cephas,
 and 
Iohn,
 who
seemed to be, yea, whom God 
made
 pillars in his Temple
) who by the Word
and Sacraments direct, conduct, and admit men into the true Church.
Pillars, bottomed on the basis of a firm faith, mounting up with a clear
shaft of a shining life, having their persevering tops garlanded about ac∣cording
to Gods
 promise, 
Be thou faithfull unto death, and I will give thee a
Crown of life.








CHAP. VII. Of the furniture of the Sanctuary, or Inner Tample.


§ 1. AMongst the Utensils of the Sanctuary, we first look on the 
Can∣dlestick,

and the light therein enables us, the better to behold all
the rest. The Tabernacle had but
 one, the Temple ten
 Candlesticks
of pure gold, (this exceeding that 
ten to one
 in lustre) 
five on the right side,
and five on the left,
 each of them no doubt fashioned like that which 
Moses

made, seven fold with a great shaft for the body in the midst, and three
stems on each side branching out thereof. In some resemblance of the
seven 
Planets,
 amongst which the 
Sun,
 the stock of light, stands in the
midst, and three other on each side, above, and beneath it. Here we can∣not
but minde the reader of a foul mistake in
 
Iosephus,
 who beholding
these Candlesticks through a multiplying glass, in stead of 
ten
 reads 
ten
thousand
 that 
Solomon
 made in his Temple. Yet we deny not, that besides
these ten standing Candlesticks of gold, there were many moe 
oveable
ones, but all those made of
 silver, which the Priests in the night might
carry about with them. By these Candlesticks also, having lights always
in them, Gods Ministers in generall were represented. For, to say, that by
these seven lamps in the ten Candlesticks (threescore and ten in all) the

 seventy Disciples were designed, would savour of too much curiosity.


§ 2. Next we take notice of the 
Table of
 shew-bread,
 which 
Solomon

made of that gold, which his Father 
David
 had peculiarly prepared for
that
 purpose. The particular dimensions, and fashion thereof,
is not mentioned in Scripture. Probably of the, like form with
that which 
Moses
 made in the Tabernacle, though of a far greater pro∣portion.
On this loaves were daily presented to God; Who, not out of
any necessity (
If I be hungry, I will not tell thee, for the
 world is mine, and the
fulness thereof
) but free will, was pleased to accept thereof: otherwise no
more needing this 
bread
 to 
feed,
 then the 
light of the lampes
 to 
guide
 him. The
bread on this Table was tendered to God, partly as a 
Quit-rent,
 in con∣fession
that the 
Iews held
 all their food from his providence; and partly
as a 
Type of Christ, The
 bread which came down from heaven.
 And, as 
serving∣men

feed on the reversions which their 
Masters
 leave, so the Priests
(when new was substituted in the room of the formet) eate those loaves
which were taken away. Not pretending with
 
Bels
 Priests, that their
God eat up, what they secretly devoured themselves; but by license
from him, they openly avouched their lawfull repast thereupon.


§ 3. But the most eminent utensill in the 
Holy,
 was the 
Altar of incense,

made by 
Moses
 in the 
Tabernacle,
 two
 cubits high, and four square:
namely, with a cubit in the length, and another in the breadth thereof.
Proportionable enough for that purpose, no sacrifices of bulk being to be
offered thereon, but onely sweet odours (much whereof might lie in


little space) and 
spirituall spices
 (as I may term them) which took up but
smal room therein. 
Davids
 express care provided
 
refined gold
 for this Altar
of incense. And no doubt, 
Solomon,
 the Executour of his Will, performed it
accordingly. For, when it is said, that he
 
covered the Altar with Cedar,
 and
that 
hee
 
overlaid the whole Altar
 (elsewhere
 
made the Altar) which was by
the Oracle with gold;
 it can refer to none other, but this 
Altar of incense;
 see∣ing,
that for burnt sacrifices, was made
 of brass. It seems that, when

Solomon
 made the 
Holy
 in the 
Temple,
 far larger then that in the 
Tabernacle,

and when every implement therein (to make the furniture proporti∣onable
to the room) 
commenced
 and 
took an higher degree
 of glory and great∣ness;
then he cased the old 
Altar of incense
 with Cedar, and overlaid the
same with gold, to be but the 
Basis
 and 
Pedestall
 of a greater Altar, which
for the same purpose he advanced thereupon.


§ 4. As for the position of this 
Altar,
 that it was not set in the 
Oracle

or 
most Holy place,
 but onely in the 
Holy,
 or 
inward Temple,
 may by the en∣suing
arguments be demonstrated.



1 The text saith expresly, 
Moses
 put it in 
the tent of the
 
congregation before
the vaile.


2 The incense thereon was to be 
perpetuall,
 renewed 
every
 
morning,
 and therefore it could not be in 
Sancto Sanctorum,
 which was pe∣netrable
but 
once a year
 for the high Priest.


3 
Zacharias
 an inferiour Priest (as of the 
eight
 
order,
 or 
course of
Abiah
) incapable to enter the 
Holy of Holies,
 officiated on this 
Altar
of incense.



Greater therefore is the difficulty, that, notwithstanding the premises so
plain to the contrary, the Authour to the 
Hebrews,
 placeth it in the 
Holy
of Holies,
 And after the second vaile, the Tabernacle, which is called the Holiest of
all, which had the golden censer, and the Ark of the Covenant &c.


§ 5. All that our best endevours can perform herein,
 is onely to pre∣sent
the severall solutions, learned men produce to the present difficulty.



1 
Iunius
 placeth this Altar within the vail, and without the 
San∣ctuary,

in so strange a posture, that scarcely either Jewish or Chri∣stian

Tacticks
 of Temple-implements, will admit thereof.


2 Others
 by the golden 
censer
 [
] understand not this
Altar of 
Incense,
 but that eminent
 
censer of Aaron
 used by him in
his contest with 
Korah,
 which they conceive (though omitted
by 
Moses
) preserved with his 
Budding rod,
 as a memoriall in the

Holy of Holies.


3 Others understand that
 
Censer
 which the high Priest once a
year carried thereinto full of incense, and which 
for the time be∣ing

was in the 
Holy of Holies,
 namely during the high Priest his
remaining therein.


4 
Ribera,
 expounding it properly of the 
Altar of incense,
 avoucheth,
that the 
Holy of Holies
 had the 
golden censer,
 not, 
quoad situm,
 but,



quoad usum;
 not within the 
compass,
 but command thereof, as
more immediately subservient thereunto.



Indeed this 
Altar of incense
 peculiarly belonged to the anniversary solem∣nity
of the 
Holy of Holies,
 upon the hornes whereof
 
once a year,
 the high
Priest with the bloud of the sin offering (sacrificed no doubt on the 
bra∣zen
Altar
 without, but) sprinkled here, made an 
atonement
 for the people.


§ 6. So much for the Utensils of the 
Holy,
 onely we will adde, that
whereas the 
Table of shew-bread,
 and 
Altar of incense
 were made by 
Moses

with
 
staves
 and 
rings,
 to make them more portable on the Priests shoul∣ders;
probably 
Solomon
 omitted the same as superfluous, when now
setled in a fixed residence. Except any will say, that as the 
Israelites
 (when
peaceably possessed of their countrey) were still enjoined to eat the 
Pass∣over

with
 
staves in their hands,
 to preserve the memory of their
 journey
at the first institution thereof: so these Utensils, even in the Temple, con∣tinued
their 
staves
 about them, in memoriall of their long pilgrimage,
and late coming home to their constant habitation.






CHAP. VIII. Of the vessels in the Holy of Holies.


§ 1. PAss we now into the 
Holy of Holies,
 into which the 
high Priest

onely entered once a year; finding three gradations in their re∣ligious
service, which waited on the Temple;



1 
Hourely
 attendance in the 
outward Courts:
 where many (Porters
especially) watched all houres of day, and night.


2 
Daily
 in the 
Holy:
 where 
lighting lampes,
 and 
burning incense

were quotidian duties.


3 
Weekly
 in the same place, where new 
shew-bread
 was substituted

every
 
Sabbath day.


4 
Yearly
 in the 
Holy of Holies;
 open onely to the anniversary entring
of the 
high Priest.



This was a 
little, house well filled
 with mysterious vessels. And for the main,
we may observe, that, although 
Solomon
 altered, and enlarged the Uten∣sils
in the 
Holy
 and 
outward Courts,
 yet in the 
Holy of Holies,
 he made use of
those numericall vessels of 
Moses
 his making, without any addition, or
alteration: as at the first formed so exactly, and fitted so suitably to the
privacy of the place, that it had been presumption to new modell them,
whose perfection was uncapeable of any higher improvement.


§ 2. Yet 
Solomon
 for the more magnificence,
 added two 
Cherubims,
 for
the matter, dimensions, position, and use thereof, distinguished from
those of 
Moses
 his making.



1 
Moses
 made his of 
pure gold
 
of beaten work,
 whilest 
Solomon,
 were
of
 
Olive-tree within,
 but 
overlaid with gold.


2 Both the former had but 
two cubits and an half
 in length (as onely


adequate to the
 
length
 of the 
Mercy-seat
) whereas each of 
Solomons
Cherubims
 was ten
 cubits in height, the greatest gallantry of the
whole Temple.


3 
Moses
 his 
Cherubims
 lay on the 
Mercy-seat,
 both whose wings
turned inward, met together, whilest 
Solomons
 were set on the
floor, whose four wings stretched outwards to the full length,
extended to the whole breadth of the 
Holy of Holies.


4 
Moses
 his 
Cherubims
 with their wings shadowed the 
Mercy-seat;
Solomons,
 like a golden arch, overshadowed those 
Cherubims;
 so
that in the 
Holy of Holies
 there was a little Hierarchy, Angels above
Angels therein.



Wonder not that whilest 
Moses
 his 
Cherubims
 were of 
Massie gold
 (bearing
best proportion to the purity, and incorporeity of the 
Angelicall Nature
)
that 
Solomons
 should be but 
overlaid with gold,
 having 
Olive-tree
 within
them. For so vast were their dimensions [
ten cubits
 or thirty foot 
high]

that if of 
solid gold,
 a little 
land of Ophir
 might have lain within that com∣pass.
And being to be made hollow, perchance it was necessary that
some wood 
for stiffenting
 should be put within them. These 
Cherubims
 were
the most gorgeous and costly ornaments in all the Temple, and proba∣bly
were embezeled by the covetous 
Babylonians
 at the 
captivity,
 and ne∣ver
brought back again, because onely essentiall
 
vessels,
 and not all the

ornaments of State,
 were restored, and placed in the second Temple. To re∣turn
to the 
Mercy-seat,
 under it: the 
Ark of the Covenant
 was placed, and
the Tables written with Gods own finger, were put therein.


§ 3. But here appeareth some contradiction,
 betwixt the furniture of
the 
Ark of the Covenant,
 as described in the 
Old
 and 
New Testament.


1 King. 8. 9. & 2 Chron: 5. 10.
 
There was nothing in the Ark save the
two tables of stone, which Moses put there
at Horeb.
Hebrews 9. 4.
 
And the Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about
w
th
 gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna &
Aarons rod that budded, & the tables of the Covenāt.

Behold here the 
Ark
 filled (not to say crowded) by the Apostle with
other implements; which the 
Old Testament
 onely a Repositary for the

Tables of the Covenant.


§ 4. Amongst the many answers tendered by learned men, in soluti∣on
to this difficulty, none in my opinion so satisfactory,
 as what
 
Ribera

first bringeth, and
 
Iunius
 (otherwise in judgement much different from
him) approveth, and enlargeth. Namely, that those words of Saint

Paul, Wherein was the golden pot &c.
 
, relates not to 

the Ark (though last named) but to 
 
the Tabernacle,
 called, 
The holiest
of all
 in the precedent verse: it being confessed of all hands, that the fore∣said

pot of Manna,
 and 
Aarons rod
 (though not within the concavity of the

Ark
) were within the compass of the 
Oracle,
 or, 
Most holy place.
 Now,
that the propriety of the tongue will bear it out, that the 
Relative
 some∣time
refers not to the next immediatly, but more remote 
Antecedent,
 ma∣ny
instances are alledged for the proof thereof.








CHAP. IX. Of the vessels in the Priests Court.


§ 1. SO much for the Utensils in the covered Temple.
 Proceed we
now into the Priests Court, and there first finde the brazen 
Altar,

having twenty
 cubits in length, as much in breadth, and ten in the
height thereof. Now, although 
Solomon
 made ten 
candlesticks,
 ten 
lavers,

ten &c. yet he confined himself to one 
Altar of incense,
 one 
Altar of sacrifice,

(multiplying of 
Altars
 hearing ill in Scripture, as suspicious of Idolatry)
but whether therein pointing at Christ our 
onely Mediatour,
 or at the unity
of the Church, let others dispute.


§ 2. Now seriously considering this 
Altar,
 we meet with many
wonders therein. First, that being set 
sub dio,
 in the open aire, it is
strange that rain (presumed sometimes to fall in great plenty, with
great violence) did not extinguish the fire thereof. Secondly, seeing
continuall fire was kept there, it is wonder, that the whole Court (as the
Chimney-generall thereof) was not turned 
Tawny-More,
 if not 
Black-More

with the constant soot, smuttiness, and smoking thereof. Third∣ly,
it is strange, that in so short time, so many sacrifices could be
consumed, within the compass of so small a place; especially at the
dedication of the Temple, when,
 
sacrificing Sheep and Oxen that
could not be told, nor numbred for multitude.
 Lastly, it is admirable, that
in a Climate so hot, and place so populous, no putrefaction did arise
from the bloud, fat, offall, and ordure of so many beasts slain there,
to the infecting of the Priests, and people thereabouts. We know
how noisome, and offensive slaughter-houses in Sommer, are in
great Cities; insomuch that 
Tertio Richardi secundi
 a motion was made,

 that no Butcher should kill any flesh within 
London,
 but at 
Knights∣bridge,

or some such distant place from the walls of the City.


§ 3. But under favour I conceive,
 the true satisfying of these dif∣ficulties
depends on the right understanding of the nature, or rather
the supernaturall qualities of the fire on the Altar. It was not com∣mon,
or culinary fire, but such as
 came down from heaven: which
(amongst other peculiar properties where with it was endowed) was
so far from being quenched by rain, or water, that it would quickly
lick it up, though
 a 
trench,
 containing 
twelve barrels,
 were filled there∣with:
as in the sacrifice of 
Elijah
 (fetching fire from the same originall)
it came to pass. Secondly, such celestiall flame, being of a more clarified,
and refined substance▪ left not any suffocating smoke, or sooty feculency
behind it. Thirdly, being sent from heaven not to dally, but dispatch the
work (God employs no slugs on his errands) it made speedy riddance of
the matter in hand, and consumed the sacrifice of a sudden. We know
how quickly 
lightning
 (though not the 
ame, much of kin to the fi
 on


the Altar) will turn any thing that resists it, into ashes. Hereupon,
some conceive, that by 
Ariel,
 that is, 
Gods Lion,
 in the
 Prophet,
the 
Altar in the Temple
 is meant. A voracious Lion indeed, which
with 
Pharaoh's
 lean kine, devoured many thousands of cattell, and was
no whit the fatter for the same. Lastly, such heavenly fire was a great
preservative against infection, and the purgative nature thereof, swept
away much putrefaction, which otherwise would have proved very
noisome.


§ 4. Pass we now from the 
fire,
 to the 
Water:
 from the 
Altar,
 to the 
Molten
sea.
 A worthy vessell this was, of solid brass; five cubits high, and ten
over from side to side, 
being
 
round all about,
 and thirty cubits in compass,
containing two thousand 
Baths:
 namely, as they filled it, but 
two parts
of three
 for ordinary use, leaving a third part for empty 
Margin
 in the top.
Otherwise were it filled brimfull, it would in all receive 
three
 thousand
Baths,
 where the totall capacity thereof is computed. Therefore called a

Sea
 from the large containt thereof (and not much unlike the 
Caspian sea,

for the circular form, and entireness thereof) having its brim wrought
about with 
lily-work,
 and it stood upon twelve oxen, which by four seve∣rall
Threes respected the quarters of the world.


§ 5. But now the question will be, How this vast vessell was furni∣shed
with water?
 
Solomon,
 speaking of the Ocean,
 
All the rivers
 (saith
he) 
run into the sea;
 but, how this artificiall 
sea,
 was supplied with any
water by peoples industry, is a considerable question; the Temple of

Ierusalem
 being so highly situated on a mountain. Here the 
Rabbins
 tell
us of a Well
 
Etam,
 some distance hence▪ whence the water was conveyed
in pipes, so that the Temple had it always in great abundance. We con∣fess,
there was a
 city, and
 rock of 
Etam
 in the Tribe of 
Simeon:
 near
to which a miraculous fountain issued in the days of 
Samson,
 to quench
his thirst, out of the 
jawbone of an Ass.
 And it seems, the 
Ghost
 of this foun∣tain
did 
walk
 in the brains of the 
Rabbins,
 when first they invented this
tradition. But, this 
Etam,
 being full forty miles from 
Ierusalem,
 was
likely to afford them little water, for the replenishing of this 
Molten sea.

Rather we beleeve, that the 
Gibeonites,
 or 
Nethinims,
 whose office it was
to be
 drawers of water for the Congregation, out of the fountain of

Siloam,
 or 
Pool of Bethesda
 hard by, filled this 
Sea,
 and furnished
all other Lavatories, and Offices about the Temple, with that necessary
element. Yea, probably there were some wells within the verge of the
Temple, seeing 
Ierusalem
 is charactred by 
Strabo,
 an Heathen writer, to
be 
, 
well watered within it self,
 though without the walls it
wanted the conveniency thereof. And, which is the main, in 
Ezekiels

description of the Temple, which one may term 
A visionarie varnish on an
historicall ground-work,
 being a literall truth mystically much improved, we
finde, the waters
 
issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward,
 which
swelled to a miraculous proportion. Now, though the increase, and


overflowing of such streams, was extraordinary, and propheticall; yet
surely the fountain thereof was reall, and naturall, importing some
springs in the Temple, whence the 
Nethinims
 did fill this 
Molten sea,
 and
all other vessels with water, designed for the Priests to
 wash themselves
therein.


§ 6. Having thus dispatched the 
Molten sea,
 the 
ten
 
Lavers
 (being as it
were but so many 
little lakes
) will quickly be described. In the 
Tabernacle

none of these were extant, as appointed for the washing of sacrifices:
(for, that single Laver made by 
Moses
 for the Priests service, answered one∣ly
to the 
Molten sea
) whereby it appears, that 
Solomon,
 not onely made in
his 
Temple,
 vessels moe in 
number,
 and bigger in 
degree,
 but also other in

kind,
 then were in the 
Tabernacle,
 to fill and furnish the magnificence there∣of.
These 
Lavers
 of brass contained forty 
Baths
 apiece, each set on his 
ba∣sis

with 
wheels,
 for their more convenient removall, though generally
their station was 
five on the one side, and five on the other
 in the Court of the
Priests, and east of the covered Temple.


§ 7. In the outward Court,
 or Court of 
Israel
 many (no doubt) were
the Utensils thereof. As that 
brazen
 
scaffold
 made by 
Solomon
 for the King
to stand, and pray upon, the same (as 
Tremellius
 conceives) with the

Kings
 
Pillar:
 with the Pulpits and deskes, wherein the Priests expoun∣ded
the law to the people. But as for the remainder of the vessels of the
Temple, with the manyfold traditions concerning them, the Reader is
referred to the learned paines of my industrious friend M
r
. 
Iohn Lightfoot:

who, as I understand, intends an entire Treatise thereof. Far be it from
me, that our pens should fall out, like the heardsmen
 of 
Lot,
 and 
Abra∣ham,
the land being not able to bear them both, that they might dwell together.
 No
such want of room in this subject, being of such latitude, and receipt,
that both we, and hundreds moe, busied together therein, may severally
lose our selves in a subject of such capacity. The rather because we em∣brace
severall courses in this our Description, it being my desire, and de∣light,
to stick onely to the written word of God, whilest my worthy
friend takes in the choicest 
Rabbinicall,
 and 
Talmudicall
 relations, being so
well seen in those studies, that it is questionable, whether his skill, or
my ignorance, be the greater therein.








CHAP. X. Of things deposited in the Chambers, and outward
Courts of the Temple.


§ 1. PRoceed we now to the outward Courts of the Temple,
 whose
Chambers were severally imployed for sundry uses: as for the
laying up of Tithes, First-fruits, Wood, Salt, and other Requisites for
the sacrifices. Of this last a mass was spent in the Temple, seeing no
offering was
 acceptable without it. The best was, 
Iudea
 could well
afford to spare plenty thereof for Gods service, who had bestowed
such store thereof upon it, that there was a place called the
 City of Salt
in the Tribe of 
Iudah.


§ 2. Other rooms were employed, to contain the many 
instruments

used in the Temple. Some of whose names we finde mentioned in
the titles of severall Psalmes, solemnly 
set
 to be sung upon them,
though so many authours so many mindes in expounding their names
and qualities, we will onely insist on what we conceive most pro∣bable.



1
 
Aijeleth
 
Shahar:
 or, 
The hinde of the morning.
 Probably
some early instrument (as the going about of the 
Waites
 in
some places) bringing tydings of the morning, and giving
men notice to rise.


2
 
Alamoth;
 which literally may be rendered
 
Virginales,
 or

Maiden-instruments,
 with high and shrill notes; 
acuta sym∣phonia,
saith Tromellius.


3
 
Gittith;
 A personall instrument, appropriated to the poste∣rity
of
 
Obed-Edom
 the 
Gittite,
 an excellent
 Master of mu∣sick,
thence taking its denomination.


4
 
Ionath Elem, Rechokim.
 By some rendered appellatively,

The dumbe Dove in far places.
 By others conceived an
instrument of sad, and dolefull musick; 
I did mourn as a Dove▪
 saith dying
 
Hezekiah.


5
 
Mahalath;
 which 
Ainsworth
 interpreteth, 
sickness,
 or 
infir∣mity,

and conceiveth it a kind of wind-instrument.


6
 
Mahalah-leannoth.
 The same with the former, but with this
addition, to
 
sing by turnes,
 which is, when alternately one
part answereth another in singing.


7
 
Mutb-labben.
 The 
Chaldee
 interpreteth it, for 
The death of the
Son
 (as if it were some cheerfull instrument made by 
David
 to
comfort himself 
after the death of his
 
child
) whilest others con∣ceive
it a kind of tune, like to that which we call the 
Counter∣tenour.



8
 
Neginah.
 A manuall instrument,
 
Nagan
 being properly to

play with the hand.


9
 
Neginoth,
 a consort of the former.


10
 
Nehiloth:
 being wind-instruments, (
Chalil
 being used for
a
 pipe) as Flutes, Cornets, and Trumpets.


11
 
Sheminitb;
 an Harp, or instrument of eight strings: con∣ceived
(no doubt) very complete in its kind, untill (as
there is daily accession and improvement in artificiall inven∣tions)
an instrument of ten
 strings got the credit from it,
as of more absolute perfection.


12
 
Shoshannim.
 Which amongst flowers is the 
Lily with six leaves,

but amongst instruments, an Harp with so many strings.


13
 
Shushan-Eduth.
 The same with the former, with the
addition of the 
Testimony,
 as used at the witnessing of some
great solemnity.



Expect not here from me a Panegyrick in praise of Musick (either
in it self, or reference to Gods service) though in Scripture appea∣ring
instrumentall to qualifie
 evill, and invite
 good spirits;
heighten devotion both in Men and Angels: seeing 
Charity,
 and

Melody, Loving,
 and 
Singing
 is almost all we finde expressed of
Celestiall happiness. Nor can any truly taxe Musick, as the chil∣dren
their mates in the market place,
 
We have piped, and yee have
not danced; we have mourned, and yee have not lamented:
 seeing such the
sociableness of Musick, it conformes it selfe to all companies,
both in mirth, and mourning, complying to improve that passion,
with which it findes the Auditours most affected. In a word, it is an
invention which might have beseemed a 
Son of Seth,
 to have been
the father thereof: Though better it was, that
 
Cains great-grand∣child

should have the credit first to finde it, then the world the unhap∣piness
longer to have wanted it.


§ 3. In other Chambers the 
standards of all measures
 were care∣fully
kept. Thus we finde the inferiour 
Levites,
 whose office was
to waite on the sons of 
Aaron,
 in severall services; and amongst
other of their employments, they had a superintendency over
 
all
manner of measures and sizes.
 Let none conceive this beneath the cal∣ling
of the 
Levites,
 to be so meanly busied; seeing in all ages
something of sacredness hath been conceived in weights, God him∣self
(
who hath ordered all things in
 
measure, and number, and weight
)
being justly reputed the supreme 
Clarke of the Market;
 for, 
All the


 
weights of the bag are his work.
 And, as God is accounted the first
founder, the 
Levites
 were esteemed the fitrest keepers of measures,
presumed men of much integrity, which willingly would not
falsifie, and deprave the same. Besides, an essentiall part of the
sacrifices consisted in the 
pars quota,
 in the exact quantity of the


meale, oyle &c. in their offerings, and therefore the Levites were
highly concerned to be skilfull in measures, as constantly converstant in
the criticalness thereof.


§ 4. Their measures were of a double nature, either of 
Application,

or of 
Capacity.
 Of the former these the principall.



1 
: 
A fingers
 
breadth,
 which 
in round reckoning.
 (though not
exactly) passed for an 
inch.


2 
, 
Palmus, A
 
span.
 Whereof the 
lesser
 contained
three 
inches;
 the 
bigger
 was the distan
e betwixt the thumbe,
and little finger extended▪


3 
 
A Cubit;
 of the severall kindes whereof largely be∣fore.


4 
 
A Reed;
 used to measure buildings, containing six

Cubits,
 and an 
hand-breadth
 in the length thereof.



Here of purpose (because ignorant of the exact proportion thereof)
we pass by the 
 
Chebel
 (whence our English 
Cable
) being a

Rope,
 or line to measure ground therewith: so that by a Metony∣mie,
sometimes it is taken for the inheritance it self, 
The
 
lines are fallen
to me in pleasant places.


§ 5. 
Measures of capacity
 follow,
 being either to 
mete
 things dry,
liquid, or both. Dry things were measured by



1 The 
Kab
, answering unto (in default of accurate cor∣respondencies,
we must pitch on the English measure
next thereunto) our 
Quart,
 the 
fourth part
 whereof [our
double 
Gill
] of 
Doves dung,
 was at the siege of 
Samaria
 sold
for 
five
 
pieces of silver.


2 
, 
Omer.
 It was the daily
 
Ordinary
 of 
Manna
 for a man, and
contained well-nigh a pottle, or two quarts.


3 
Ephah.
 The just quantity that 
Ruth
 gleaned in a day
Concerning this measure let these following Scriptures be
observed, lest similitude of sound betray us to a great
mistake:



1. 
An Omer is the tenth part of an Ephah.
 Exod. 16. 36.


2 
The Ephah is the tenth part of an Homer.
 Ezek. 45. 11.



It was in fashion shallow, and broad, (so that a
 
woman

might sit in the compass thereof) and contained halfe a
bushell, and a pottle; wherefore 
Boaz
 his bounty con∣curred
with 
Ruth
 her diligence in making so good a days∣work.


4 
, 
Homer;
 that is, 
The lading of Asse,
 being five bushels,
and five gallons. God threatneth in his Prophet, that, 
The
seed of an
 
Homer should yeeld
 but 
an Ephah,
 that is, their grain
should so decrease, they should onely reap 
the tithe
 of what
they had sown. The half of an 
Homer
 was called a
 
Lethec.



Here we wittingly omit the 
 
Seah,
 because unsatisfied in the
content thereof; though surely it must be much more, then what
a learned
 man makes it, stinting it to a gallon, and an half:
for, by that proportion no incredible plenty, or cheapness was pro∣phecied
in 
Samaria,
 when
 
a Seah of fine flour
 should be sold 
for a shekel

(or an English half-crown) which is according to the rate of a 
Mark

the bushell; dear enough of all conscience for poor people to purchase.




§ 6. As for 
Measures
 for 
Liquids,
 we first pitch on an 
Hin,

whereof frequent mention in Scripture (as also of the
 
half,


 
third,
 
fourth,
 and
 
sixt
 part thereof) and contained three Eng∣lish
Quarts. Next it we take notice of the 
Bath,
 being just of the
same capacity with the 
Ephah,
 and the tenth part of an 
Homer,
 as
the Prophet
 himself hath computed it, that is, 
four gallons and an
half.
 By which account the 
Molten sea,
 which held three
 thousand 
Baths,

contained thirteen thousand five hundred gallons.


§ 7. Amongst 
mixt measures
 the 
Cor
 deserveth especiall notice; used both
for



1 Liquid.
 
The Cor of Oyle.


2 Arid. 
,
 
Cors of wheat.



The 
Cor
 was (as may be collected from the
 Prophet) just the
same quantity with the 
Homer
 (as in the best English, 
Bushell,

and 
Strike
 are severall names for the same measure) save that the

Cor
 was common to both, the 
Homer
 appropriated to liquid com∣modities.


§ 8. To measures might be added the 
gage
 of
 
Barrels,
 and

 
Firkins;
 as also all 
Weights
 and 
Coines,
 as 
Gerahs, Half Shekels,
Shekels of the
 
Sanctuary,
 (so called, as some will have it, because the

Standart
 thereof was kept in the Sanctuary, whilest others make it
double to the common 
Shekel) Drams, Pounds, Talents,
 whereof
largely
 heretofore. All which we leave in the 
Levites
 safe custo∣dy,
being confident, that they will very carefully keep them, from
ever coming into the fingers of such covetous wretches, who
would willingly make 
The Ephah small, and the
 
Shekel great, and
falsifie the ballances by deceit;
 especially, if the 
Originals
 of both were but
once in their absolute disposall thereof.


§ 9. There were also 
Books
 kept in the Temple,
 of which the Auto∣graph

of the law
 was most remarkable, by command from 
Moses
 to be pla∣ced

in the
 
side of the Ark of the Covenant,
 that is,
 
by the side
 (as some expound
it) in a coffer by it self made for that purpose. But others conceive the
performance hereof neglected after 
Moses
 his decease (before which time
it could not conveniently be done, 
Deuteronomy
 not being fully finished
till after his death) and this book deposited, not in the 
Holy of Holies
 but
in some outward place amongst the treasures of the Temple: Alledging
in confirmation hereof, how 
Hilkiah
 the 
high Priest,
 sent to seek out and
sum
 up the silver for repairing of Gods house, 
found
 (what in 
Davids



and all good mens valuation is dearer then
 
gold and silver) the
 
book of the
Law,
 hid in some treasury within the verge of the Temple. But proba∣bly
this book was originally placed in the 
Holy of Holies,
 which after∣wards,
when the Temple-service in the Idolatrous days of 
A
az,
 and

Manasseh
 was 
turned upside down,
 might 
fall out
 of the proper position
thereof, into another place.


§ 10. Other books (no doubt) were kept by the Priests (
Scribes,
 wher∣of
many amongst them,
 and 
books
 being 
relatives
) though their Libraries
could not be so numerous in volumes, the 
Art of printing
 not being then
invented. Wherefore, when we read in 
Iob,
 a most ancient authour,
 
Oh
that they were printed in a book!
 the mystery of the 
Press
 is not meant thereby,
but letters written in deep and large characters. And amongst all other
books most likely it is, that, that book of the
 
description of the land into se∣ven
parts by lot,
 as of publick concernment, daily use, and divine instituti∣on,
was preferred in the Temple; like our 
Domes-day
 book in 
England,

which some Criticks will have so called (not because all lands are arraig∣ned
to appear therein as at a 
General Iudgment,
 but) 
quasi domus Dei,
 or 
Gods∣house

book, where the originall thereof, was anciently intrusted.


§ 11. The 
Refectories
 must not be forgotten,
 being roomes, wherein
the Priests had their repast on hallowed food. Amongst all whose fare,
we most admire at the 
Shew-bread;
 that, being shifted but
 once a week
by Gods command, it did not contract corruption, grow hard, and dry,
good onely for the 
Gibeonites
 to cheat the 
Israelites,
 with the
 mouldiness
thereof. This the 
Rabbins
 ascribe to miracle, the same command, which
enjoined it to be set there, preserving it from putrefaction; that nothing
might lose ought of its goodness, which is exactly ordered according
to Gods direction. Thus, as 
Man liveth not by bread alone:
 so bread lasteth
not onely by naturall causes, but
 
by every word which proceedeth out of the
mouth of God.


§ 12. And now (to conclude all fast and firme) there was al∣so
an 
Armory
 in the Temple,
 well provided with weapons, to
guard the Treasure therein. For, seeing it is the priviledge of hea∣ven
alone, that there
 
Theeves cannot break through, and steal;
 the
provident Princes of the 
Iewes
 thought not fit to entrust so much
wealth without Ammunition to defend it, seeing no place so sa∣cred
as to secure it self from sac
iledge. 
David
 provided
 
Speares,
and bucklers, and shields for that purpose,
 as if foreseeing in his Prophe∣ticall
spirit, that in after ages, a distressed Prince [
Ioash
] extracted
from his loines, should, by Gods blessing, and the assistance of
those
 weapons, recover his rightfull throne from the unjust usur∣pation
of [
Athaliah
] an Idolatrous intrudress thereinto.








CHAP. XI. The additionall Utensils of the Temple after
the days of Solomon.


§ 1. MAny other instruments were added to the Temple,
 after

Solomons
 death, by succeeding Kings, as occasion did require.
Amongst which, we must take especiall notice of that Chest,
which in the reign of King 
Iehoash,
 was made by 
Iehoiada
 the high-Priest,
to receive the peoples free-offerings for the repair of the Temple.


§ 2. It may seem strange,
 that the Temple built so substantially at
the first, of the most solid materialls, should in so short a time of an
hundred and fifty years, run so far to ruine, as to need so costly repara∣tion.
But, we must know, it stood without shelter, high on a mount,
exposed to tempests, and in the last seven years of wicked 
Athaliahs
 reign
(gray hairs are multiplyed on men, more by afflictions, then old age)
besides neglect of reparation, did
 meet with despightfull defacing
thereof. 
Iehoash
 therefore resolves to amend the decays therein, as in∣deed
he stood obliged, both in credit, and conscience; for, seeing the
Temple had formely been the nursing-mother to 
Iehoash,
 well might

Iehoash
 be the nursing-father to the Temple; who now did onely

, pay for his feeding and breeding, who six years

 had his preservation, and his education therein.


§ 3. The care of the work,
 was at first committed to the charge of the 
Le∣vites

in generall, though it thrived not under their managing therof, so that
in the twenty third year of the reign of King 
Iehoash, they had not repaired the


 
breaches of the house.
 We can not be so uncharitable, as to conceive, they
embez'led the monies appointed for that purpose, but rather impute
their slow proceedings herein, either to



1 The unhappiness usually attending great undertakings, few
effectually advancing that work, wherein all are equally in∣trusted.
Or else,


2 Being every one 
to receive money of their own
 
acquaintance,
 some car∣nall
indulgence might be used therein to retard the business.


3 Receiving small sums of severall persons, they were insensible
in the taking, and inconsiderable in their laying out.


4 Repairing was out of the 
Levites
 element, having no dexterity
therein; and we know, that Ministers, and Church-wardens
are two distinct employments.



Hereupon the 
Levites
 by King 
Iehoash
 are called, checked, commanded
to forbear farther collection of money, and some other particular persons
deputed for that purpose, who had more care, skill, and success to order
the matter.



§ 4. To this end a chest was devised,
 with an hole
 bored in the
lid thereof, and appointed to receive the free-gifts of those who would
contribute to so pious a work. It was placed very handy, and conve∣nient
for such as went up to sacrifice, to cast in their b
nevolence, being

set
 beside the Altar on the right side
 in the outward-court 
as one came into the
House of the Lord.
 Perchance our Saviour reflected on the position of
this chest so fit for dexterous Benefactours, when advising in giving of
almes, 
Let
 not thy left hand know what thy right doth.
 In this chest were
mens charities cast, and kept till amounting to a great sum, (and then
the breaches of the Temple were perfectly repaired therewith) and
in after-ages, it was called 
Corban,
 which name sometimes signi∣fieth
the
 gift it self, sometimes the vessell receiving it, which
was the pattern (not to say parent) of the 
poor-mens-boxes
 in our
modern Parish-Churches.


§ 5. Here we must not forget that Diall of 
Ahaz
 (in those days,
no doubt, a master-piece of art) whereon the Sun miraculously
went back ten
 degrees, in token that 
Hezekiahs
 life should goe
forward fifteen degrees. Some conceive this Dial, not drawn on
the outside of any wall, or house, but contrived within a winding
stair-case, so that every step thereof bare proportion to the distance
of an houre: but whether this fancy may be reconciled to art, be
it referred to the judicious in dialling. However it was made, we
shall scarce meet with a Dial more ancient in any authour, which
many years after retained the name of 
Ahaz
 the erectour thereof.
But for all this Dial, 
Ahaz
 was one of those who could not 
dis∣cern

 the signes of the times,
 nor perceive 
the day of his visitation;
 how
his kingdome, being past the flourishing Meridian thereof, did draw
near to the night of finall ruin, and destruction.


§ 6. 
Adrichomius
 placeth this Dial on the House of the Lord,
 and
therefore we mention it here amongst the ornaments of the Tem∣ple.
Though, to speak my opinion, on perusall of the text, it ap∣pears
rather set up in some open place in the Kings Palace, so that
sick 
Hezekiah,
 for the farther confirmation of his faith, lying on
his bed, might look on the retrograde motion of the Sun thereon:
though I deny not, but he might receive information thereof from
relation of others. But would
 
Adrichomius
 had acquainted us, whence
he received his intelligence, for what he reports, that 
Ahaz
 made
this Dial of the brazen
 Altar of whole-burnt sacrifices. Indeed

 Scripture tells us, that he took down the twelve brazen oxen
from under the great sea, and it was poor reparation for his
sacriledge, if in lieu thereof he set up a Dial, with figures for
twelve houres, or perchance the twelve signes of the Zodiack there∣upon.
But carnall men conceive, they may safely steale Gods dove,
and stick down a feather in the room thereof.



§ 7. Now besides the originall Utensils of the Temple,
 of the
same foundation with the Temple it self, there were severall re∣cruits
(not of different, but the same fashion with the former)
which succeeding Kings made in stead of those instruments, which
constant use and age had empaired. For, we must not think, that
the Ash-pans, Fire-pans, Snuffers, Caldrons, and Flesh-hooks of
the Temple, were like the bush appearing to
 
Moses,
 always
burning, yet never consumed: or, that the knives used about the
sacrifices, were like the
 clothes of the children of 
Israel
 in the
wilderness, never a whit the worse for wearing, but they did
daily decay, and were duly repaired, especially in the reign of King

 
Iehoash.
 Thus when the soul of a Christian is by faith made the
Temple of the holy Ghost, and fitted with severall graces, the furni∣ture
thereof; the same notwithstanding, because of continuall sin∣ning,
must be constantly repaired by renuing repentance.


§ 8. So much of the right and lawfull issue of holy vessels in the
Temple.
 As for that spurious, and bastard brood of Idolatrous
Altars, and other Utensils principally introduced by King
 
Ahaz
 and

 
Manasseh,
 contrary to Gods express command, and placed in the
house of God, we will not doe them so much honour as once to
mention them in this discourse.






CHAP. XII. The Temple often spoiled of her Treasure
and Ornaments.


§ 1. THe first Temple of God at 
Ierusalem,
 often had the same
hard hap with him that journied thence to 
Iericho,
 even

to fall
 amongst theeves,
 or rather for theeves to fall into it.
Twice was it pillaged by forein foes, and four times by her own friends
before the finall destruction thereof. First, when 
Shishak
 King of 
Egypt

in the reign of 
Rehoboam, took
 away the treasures of the house of the Lord,

This wound, whence so much precious wealth did bleed forth, first
shewed, the Temple with the riches therein to be mortall. 
Shishak

did then but brush the house of God, whilest he swept the house of
the King, whence 
he even took away
 
all.
 Afterwards 
Ioash
 King of 
Israel

in the reign of King 
Amaziah,
 having stormed 
Ierusalem,
 took
 
All the
gold and silver, and the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom,
and returned to Samaria. That were found,
 for, such no doubt was the
providence of the Priests to conceal some wealth from his sight. A
thing not impossible for them to doe, having formerly hid a young
King, and his nurse six
 years invisible, from the jealous eyes of 
Atha∣liah.



And now, seeing idolatrous 
Ioash
 carried away this holy treasure
to 
Samaria,
 let none hereafter conclude the best cause from the best
success, finding the Cherubims of 
Solomons
 setting up, worsted by the
golden Calves of 
Ieroboams
 erection.


§ 2. By the way, it is very remarkable, that the Tabernacle,
 which
lasted four hundred and thirty years before the Temple was begun,
was never plundered, or robbed, or spoiled of its goods. Yet the 
Iews

in that age were as sinfull, and their enemies as spightfull, 
Moabites, Mi∣dianites,
Ammonites, &c.
 who in the interim betwixt the Judges, oppres∣sed
the people of 
Israel,
 though we finde none of them offering any af∣front,
or violence to the Utensils of the Tabernacle. As for the 
Philistims,

though they took the Ark by conquest in the field, we know they were
forced with a witness to bring it back again. Whereas the Temple within
less space was by forein Princes often pilled and polled of the ornaments
belonging thereunto. Enquiring into the reason hereof, we meet with
none more probable, then because Divine providence delighteth in pro∣tecting
what is weakest in it self. And seeing the Tabernacle was altoge∣ther
undefensible, and able to make no resistance, consisting onely of thin
boards, slight skins, & slender curtains, God more immediately walled it
about with an awefull respect, which the very enemies thereof bare unto
it. Whereas the Temple, being a strong structure of stone, in a stronger
City, with walls, gates, and bars, visibly intitled it self to fortification,
and therefore God left it to the arme of flesh to defend it, which fre∣quently
failed therein, as nothing can be safe, which hath onely 
infull
men to secure it.


§ 3. But the Temple suffered oftner from her friends,
 then her foes,
frequently spoiling the wealth thereof, insomuch, that in all desperate
consumptions of the State, no gold was found so cordiall to cure it, as
what was taken out of the treasury of the Temple.



1 
Asa brought out silver and
 gold, out of the treasuries of the house of the
Lord,
 and bestowed them on 
Benhadad
 King of 
Syria,
 to purchase
his assistance against 
Baasha
 King of 
Israel.


2 
Iehoash
 to appease the anger of 
Hazael
 King of 
Syria,
 marching
furiously against him, took
 
all the hallowed things, which his Fathers,
and himself had dedicated,
 and sent them as a gift to 
Hazael,
 to stop
his coming up against 
Ierusalem.


3 
Ahaz took the silver and gold
 which was found in the house of the Lord,

and conferred it on 
Tiglath-Pileser,
 to hire his help against the
Kings of 
Syria
 and 
Israel.


4 
Hezekiah cut off
 the gold wherewith he himself had overlaid the doors, and
pillars of the Temple,
 and gave it to pacifie 
Sennacherib
 coming a∣gainst
him.



Not to mention the waste, and havock, wicked
 
Athaliah,
 and 
Manasseh

made, in their idolatrous reigns, of the vessels of the Temple.



§ 4. There want not those,
 who dare to defend the foresaid spoiling
of Gods house to be lawfull, chiefly alleadging absolute necessity (that
bawd
 generall of all illegitimate actions) that, otherwise, in such extremi∣ties,
the kingdome of 
Iudah
 could not be preserved, from forein invasi∣on.
In vain doth 
what may be
 dispute, when 
what must be
 sits Doctour
of the Chaire. It is not onely lawfull, but needfull, to shave the haire,
thereby to save the head. The parting with the fruit, kept the tree alive;
otherwise, if not pacified with such a present, the idolatrous enemies
would undoubtedly have demolished the Temple, and totally rooted
out Gods service therein.


§ 5. But what ever politick palliations may be pleaded for the con∣trary,

such sacriledge was unavouchable in it self, and those pretended
extremities to justifie it, were onely created; either by mens infidelity,
not beleeving Gods power; or their impatience, not atten∣ding
Gods pleasure, to defend his own glory, in his own due time,
by his own means. Yea, Heaven by the finall success protested against
such proceedings, and the treasure taken out of the Temple, and given to
Pagans, rather presently declined, then finally diverted the imminent
danger. Thus 
Ahaz
 took away a portion out of the house of the Lord, and gave
it to the King of Assyria, but he helped him not.
 Likewise when
 
Hezekiah
 pre∣sented

Sennacherib
 with the wealth of the Temple to buy his favour, his
bribes proved ineffectull, who having received the present, was not
pleased to understand the language thereof, but nevertheless in the next

 verse invaded 
Iudah.
 As for the instance of 
Asa,
 God directly by the
mouth of his Prophet reproved him for his fact, in relying rather on the
King of 
Syria,
 then divine assistance. In a word, though some were
good men that did it, they were no whit the better for the doing it.
For, though it be Christian policy, and Christs
 precept, 
that men make to
themselves friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness;
 yet, goods rightly conse∣crated
to the righteous God, come not under that appellation: and such
holy things are unjustly 
degraded,
 which having once been advanced
to the dignity of a 
free-will-offering
 to God, are afterward set back, to be∣come
a 
peace-offering
 to man.


§ 6. Indeed some hold,
 that under the Gospell the sin of sacriledge
cannot be committed. If so, it is either because nothing under the
Gospell hath been given to Gods service; or, because God hath solemn∣ly
disclaimed the acceptance of any such donations; which, when and
where it was done, will be hardly produced. If this their position be true,
we have cause, first, to rejoyce in regard that God and his members are
now adays growen so rich, that they need not addition of humane gra∣tuities
to be bestowed upon them. Secondly, we may congratulate the
felicity of ours above former ages, being not in a capacity of committing
the sin of sacriledge, to which those were subject, who lived before the
time of our Saviour. Lastly, we may silently smile, to see how Satan is


defeated, having quite lost one of his an
ient baites, and old temptati∣ons;
men now adays being secured from this sin, and put past a possi∣bility
to be guilty thereof. But, before we goe thus far, let us first be sure,
we goe on a good ground, otherwise it is the highest sacriledge, to steal
away sacriledge it self, and to deny that (which formerly was a grie∣vous)
in our days to be any transgression.


§ 7. To come now to the finall, and fatall dissolution of this Temple,
with the dissipation, at least wise transportation of all the Utensils
thereof.



Three gradations herein may be observed.

Here we will not observe the eleventh year of wicked kings, climacte∣ricall

when the measure of their sins is made up. Rather we will take notice,
how God, twice as it were in mercy, clipt the treasures of the Temple
with the 
cisers,
 and (neither working repentance) the third time in
justice shaved all away, with the 
hired
 
razor
 of 
Babylon.
 And it is my
opinion, that though the outward Courts, and chambers of the Tem∣ple
had formerly been frequently plundred, yet the 
Holy,
 and 
Holy of
Holies
 remained entire, and untouched, till all was destroyed at the ca∣ptivity
of

TEMPLE, REBUILT BY

CHAP. I. The mean preparations for building this Temple.


§ 1. 
T
He seventy years of the 
Babylonish
 captivity expi∣red,
God moved the spirit of 
Cyrus
 (whose name
the Prophet
 mentioneth two hundred years be∣fore
his birth) not onely by his
 proclamation
to permit Gods people, to return to their native
Countrey, and thereby to encourage others to
contribute necessaries unto them; but also restored the vessels of 
Solomons

making, and furnished them with provisions out of his own Exchequer,
for the erection of a second Temple, which came after the former, not moe
years in time, then degrees in magnificence. A thing no whit strange,
if the disparity betwixt the builders be seriously considered.


§ 2. First,
 
Solomon
 was an absolute Prince, full of wealth and power,
in his peaceable Countrey, where no 
dog durst bark against him
 (save two

 or three whapping curs toward the end of his reign) whilest the buil∣ders
of this second Temple were but raw captives, newly returned to
their native land, where they met with much disturbance, and con∣stant
opposition from their enemies. Wherefore, no such (almost mi∣raculous)
silence observed at the second Temple, like that in the first,
wherein
 
no tool of iron was heard,
 it being probable, here was knocking of
hammers, and (certain) here was clashing of malicious foes agains
 the
faithfull 
Israelites.


§ 3. Secondly,
 
Solomon
 (though alternately) employed 
seven score
 
and
ten thousand hewers and burden-bearers,
 besides 
three thousand three hundred over∣seers

at the building of his Temple; whereas the totall sum, and whole
company of this 
Remnant,
 or rather, 
Reversion
 of the 
Iews,
 with 
their


servants
 
and maids,
 exceeded not fifty thousand, not amounting to a full
third of the former number. As few the men: so were they ill furni∣shed
with all kinde of cattell. And whereas 
Camels
 had been necessary
creatures to be used by them, for bearing of burdens at this structure, so
meanly were they provided therewith, that
 
Iob
 a private man, had six
times (and after his restoration 
twelve
 times) more 
Camels,
 then all the
whole nation of the 
Iews
 had in their possession, when returning from
captivity.


§ 4. Thirdly,
 
Solomon
 had (besides other vast in-comes, and a 
bank

provided by 
David
 his Father) the 
gold of Ophir
 swimming unto him in
the 
ships
 
of Tarshish,
 making their trienniall returns. Whereas no such

golden fleet
 arrived to the building of this second 
Temple.
 As for 
silver,
 in

Solomons
 time it was
 
in Ierusalem as stones in abundance;
 but, in 
Zorobabels

time, 
silver
 was as 
silver
 in scarcity, and esteem, and the 
exchange
 of all
coin ran very high in valuation. And, whereas the cost expended by

Solomon
 on his Temple amounted to many thousands of
 
Talents,
 unto
which are added 
ten
 
thousand drams of gold
 (onely as a supernumerary
fraction, or odde sum above the entire Talents) the free-will-offering
to the second Temple is not at all computed by 
Talents,
 which would
have disgraced their poor provisions, but (to stick to our 
new translation
)
is onely summed up by
 
drams
 (as the silver not by 
Talents,
 but 
pounds
)
for the greater grace and credit of their contribution, so small in it self,
but large (no doubt) in proportion unto their poor estates.


§ 5. Lastly,
 here was not (as in the making of the Tabernacle) any

Bezaleel,
 or 
Aholiab, filled with the
 
Spirit of God in all manner of workmanship;

no 
Hiram
 (as at the building of the Temple)
 
filled with wisedome, and un∣derstanding,
and cunning to work all works in brass;
 no extraordinary artificer
specified by name, employed therein. Yet, probably, they entertained
the best workmen that age did afford, their purses or credit could pro∣cure,
to polish, and adorn the building. And therefore the ingenuous

 
Romanists
 acknowledge a gross errour in their 
vulgar Latine,
 where they
read
 
ordines de lapidibus impolitis tres, three rows of unpolished stone,
 which
should be 
polished stone.
 For, 
 
Eben Gelal
 in the originall, is a stone

turned, rolled,
 and 
tossed
 about, to smooth, and levigate every side there∣of,
and by
 
Iosephus
 is rendred 
,
 of 
sha∣ved,
hewed
 or 
carved stone.
 However, our last translation (following 
Tre∣mellius

therein) reades it GREAT STONES, as if the state consisted,
rather in their bigness, then beauty; amplitude, then art bestowed up∣on
them.


§ 6. Timber they fetched from
 mount 
Libanus
 (the magazeen of
Cedars) brought thence in ships to 
Ioppa,
 and thence conveyed by land∣carriages
to 
Ierusalem.
 But, we may be assured, that 
Solomon
 long agoe
had flitted the cream of the choicest trees in that mountain, this second
generation being lesser, lower, and fewer, then those before them. Yea,


in process of time, 
Cedars
 were so rarified in 
Libanus,
 that
 modern
travellers saw but four and twenty in their passage over this mountain,
and heard but of a few moe (and they all in one place) extant there at
this day.


§ 7. Some will object,
 all these defects were eminently supplyed by
the favour of 
Cyrus,
 who in his 
Charta Magna
 for the building of the
Temple, had privided, that 
the expences be
 
given out of the Kings house;
 and
water may sooner be wanting at the well-head, then they lack accom∣modations,
who commanded the coffers of so mighty a Monarch. But,
such must take notice of the great space of ground, betwixt 
Ierusalem
 and

Babylon;
 and the bounty of Kings (especially at so great a distance)
maketh more noise in the mouths of the reporters, then it brings profit
into the hands of the receivers. So that all things considered, whilest 
So∣lomons

Temple, like the eldest son, and heir, went away with the solid
inheritance of a world of wealth; this latter, like the younger brother,
was contented with a poor pension of the peoples bounty allotted unto
it, especially at the inconsiderable beginning thereof.


§ 8. Wherefore at the foundation of this Temple,
 the old men
 wept
at the laying thereof, who could call to minde the greatness, and gallan∣try
of the former. How great was the griefe of our first parents after
their expulsion ou
 of paradise, when comparing their present with
their primitive condition, and what was lost, with what was left unto
them? Enough to drown them in despair, if not supported with certain
expectation of the 
promised Seed.


§ 9. But the youngsters,
 being moe in number, and greater in
strength, shouted for joy, conceiving the foundations newly laid a
matchless fabrick for magnificence, having never seen better, nor other
in that place. Thus, such as have been bred in the 
dark,
 when first
brought into the 
twilight,
 admire at the incomparable lustre thereof.
But, what saith our proverbe? 
Better children weep, then old folk:
 and it
had been happy, if here (by a transposition of their passions) whilest
the 
young folk
 sorrowed, the 
old men
 had rejoyced: the former 
thinking

themselves to have just occasion of mirth, the latter 
knowing
 they had too
much reason for mourning.


§ 10. But, what saith the Prophet,
 in reference to this mean fabrick?

Who hath despised the day of small things?
 God, who is 
all in all,
 delights to
improve such things, as are next to 
nothing.
 He that loved the 
Iews
 best,
who were
 
the fewest of all people;
 who made 
Gedeon
 a Judge, who was
the
 
least in his Fathers house; Saul
 a King, whose family was the
 
least of
all in his Tribe▪ Paul
 a preacher, the
 
least of the Apostles;
 who delighted in

 
little Benjamin their ruler,
 the 
little hill of Hermon,
 the
 
lowliness of his hand∣maiden;

who multiplyeth 
mustard-seed the
 
least of all grains
 into a 
tree,
 did
cherish and hatch this weak building under the wings of his protection,
bringing it from feeble beginnings; by faint proceedings, to full per∣fection.








CHAP. II. The dimensions of the Temple, and the foundations thereof laid.


§ 1. BE it premised for an undeniable truth,
 that this Temple fell
short of 
Solomons
 in the dimensions thereof. Which plainly
appears, first, by the question the Prophet propoundeth;
 
Who
is le
t among you, that saw this house in her first glory? and how doe you see it now?
Is it not in your eies, in comparison of it, as nothing?
 Secondly, by the tears the
old men
 shed, when the
 foundation thereof was laid, whilest they
beheld the meanness of the one with their eyes, and recollected the
magnificence of the other in their memories.


§ 2. But here we meet with (almost) an inextricable difficulty.

For, notwithstanding the premises so plain to the contrary, the dimen∣sions
of 
Cyrus
 his Temple appear larger then those of 
Solomons,
 if the en∣suing
parable be seriously perused.


1 King. 6. 2.
 
And the house which King Solomon built
for the Lord, the length thereof was threescore
cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,
and the height thereof thirty cubits.
Ezra 6. 3.
 
Let the foundations thereof be strongly
laid, the height thereof threescore
cubits, and the breadth thereof three∣score
cubits.

Behold here, how 
Cyrus
 his Temple was 
thirty Cubits
 higher (just as
high again) and 
forty cubits
 broader (thrice as broad) as 
Solomons.
 And,
although the length of this second Temple is not expressed, yet an ordi∣nary
judgement will infer by the symmetrie of building, that the length
thereof must needs be much greater, to manage such a breadth in any
due proportion of Architecture. This so strong an evidence to the con∣trary,
would almost have perswaded one to beleeve, that their old men
were either deceived with their dim eyes, or mistaken in their fraile
memories, and that this Temple was greater then the former, did not
the infallible testimonies of the
 Prophets so peremptorily avouch the
comparative smalness thereof, in respect of 
Solomons.


§ 3. Many are the solutions,
 which the learned produce in satis∣faction
of this difficulty. But, first, as for their conjecture, that 
Zorobabel,

at the building of this Temple, purposely abated of those dimensions
assigned by 
Cyrus
 (as too great for him to compass) contenting him∣self
with a less scantling, but more proportionable to the weak power
of his people: I can in no wise concur with them therein. For, in such
de
alcation of measures by 
Cyrus
 allotted, he shewed little courtship to
his master the Emperour, (in distrusting the performance of his pro∣mises)
and less religion to 
the Lord his God,
 in not beleeving, that he,
who miraculously 
had stirred up the spirit of Cyrus
 to appoint, would
also vigorously inable him (or his successours) to effect the aforesaid

assignment,
 in building of his Temple.



§ 4. Some suspect a mistake of numbers in 
Cyrus
 his 
Grant,
 which
notwithstanding will very hardly be admitted. For, seeing the laws of
the 
Medes
 and 
Persians
 could
 
never be altered,
 they were highly concerned
to be accurate, and exact, in their entering, and inrolling all 
Deeds on
Record.
 O
hers justly make a difference in the measures, and whilest

Solomons
 were sufficiently known to have been of the
 
first measure,
 they
conceive 
Cyrus
 his cubits to be common ones, but half as large as the
former. And thus this second Temple, though sixty cubits high, was
for the main body thereof, but just even with 
Solomons
 Temple. Mean time
it came far short of 
Solomons
 in this respect, because 
Solomons
 had amost
beautifull 
Porch,
 in nature of a 
Tower-steeple,
 one hundred and twenty
cubits high (that was double the body of the Temple) whilest no such
aspiring building graced the second Temple, being all of one uniforme
height.


§ 5. This difficulty in the height thus satisfied,
 by the difference of

cubits,
 let none be troubled at the breadth of this second Temple, tripling
that of 
Solomons,
 seeing here 
breadth
 is taken (as elsewhere in Scripture)
for the 
full extent of a thing on every side.
 Thus in the
 
Revelation,
 Saint 
Iohn

speaking of the numberless army of 
Gog
 and 
Magog,
 describes them to

goe upon the breadth of the earth,
 that is, on the whole space of the surface
thereof. Nor is the Hebrew 
 
Rekbo
 (which properly signifieth 
his
breadth,
 and is used. 
1 King. 6. 2.
) used in 
Ezra,
 but the 
Chaldee
 
 which
(as
 
Ribera
 observeth) importeth the expansion, or spreading of a
thing, 
quaquaversum,
 on every side. On which consideration, it is judi∣ciously
rendered by 
Tremellius,
 not 
latitudine,
 but 
amplitudine ejus,
 not the

breadth,
 but the largeness thereof. So that 
Cyrus
 gave order, that the
bigness of this Temple (length and breadth put together) should not
exceed threescore cubits (perchance forty in length, and twenty in
breadth) and so, both when first founded, and when fully finished, it
came far short of the dimensions of 
Solomons.






CHAP. III. After many obstructions, finished at last.


§ 1. NOw went the building hopefully on,
 probable in some com∣petent
time to come to perfection; when the 
Samaritans
 (the
envious enemies of 
Israel
) first by fraud, then force, endevour
to obstruct their proceedings. First, they tender
 their service to be
fellow-builders with the 
Iews,
 (claiming a joynt-interest in their Tem∣ple,
as serving the same God) which by 
Zorobabel,
 and the Elders of 
Israel

was wisely refused, as knowing, such seeming helpers would prove
reall hinderers. Thus, when
 
Satan transformes himself into an Angel of light,



as pretending to sing 
Gloria in excelsis,
 with the rest of those heavenly
Spirits, it is onely out of design to disturbe their harmony, and (if pos∣sible)
to put that celestiall Quire out of 
une.


§ 2. Their first project failing,
 the 
Samaritanes
 accuse the City of 
Ie∣rusalem

in the Court of 
Artaxerxes
 King of 
Persia,
 to have been formerly
a
 
rebellious city,
 referring themselves to the Court-rolls for the proof there∣of.
See what it is to be a 
Rebell on record,
 their posterity may fare the
worse for it, many years after. Indeed, it cannot be denied, but that

Zedekiah
 King in 
Ierusalem,
 though 
sworn by God
 to the contrary,
 
rebelled
against King Nebuchadnezzar,
 so that this suggestion of the 
Samaritans,
 had
too much of truth, though more of malice therein. For, hence they in∣ferred,
were the place rebuilt, the people would return to their former
stubbornness, whereby, in process of time, the 
Persian Monarchy
 would be
deprived of all command, and
 revenue 
on this side the river
 of 
Iordan.


§ 3. Power,
 and Profit are the two 
apples
 of Princes 
eyes,
 woundable
with the least touch thereof. No wonder therefore if upon the premises,
a Prohibition was presently from 
Artaxerxes
 sent, and served upon the

Iews,
 commanding them to desist from building till farther order
should be
 given them. Thus the work ceased till the second of 
Darius.

Mean time private palaces in 
Ierusalem
 were finished, and garnished
with
 
ceiled work,
 whilest Gods Temple lay waste. Did not those priva
e
houses blush at their own bravery, as serving-men may be justly asha∣med,
to see themselves finer then their Masters?


§ 4. Then arose 
Haggai,
 and 
Zachary,
 and
 encouraged the people
to build again. What, must the Pulpit be obeyed before the Throne?

 
In the word of a King there is power,
 but is there more in the mouth of a
Prophet? Oh! a greater then 
Artaxerxes
 was here, these Prophets being
warranted by divine inspiration. On goes the Temple afresh, whilest
the enemies of 
Israel
 seek in vain to hinder it the second time. For, upon
search, the originall grant of 
Cyrus
 is produced from amongst the Re∣cords
of the
 
Medes,
 in pursuance whereof, 
Darius
 did not onely give
leave, and liberty to the 
Iews
 to build their Temple, with a penalty on
such as refused it, but also enjoyned 
Tatnai,
 
Shethar-Boznai,
 and others
beyond the river (which sided with the 
Samaritans
) to contribute all
necessaries towards the finishing, and furnishing thereof. No doubt
the 
Iews
 (formerly refusing their persons) accepted their purses to
build with, as knowing, though the men were false, their money might
be made faithfull towards the farthering of the work.


§ 5. As for the many chronologicall differences,
 wherewith the
building of this Temple is encumbred, we utterly decline them as alien
from our subject. 
He that medleth
 (saith
 
Solomon) with strife belonging not
to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the eares.
 Chronology (all know) is a
surly, churlish Cur, and hath bit many a mans fingers, who have cause∣lesly
medled therewith. Blame me not therefore, if willing to keep


mine own hands whole. Onely I will adde, that such are much trou∣bled,
who apply to this Temple those words of the 
Iews
 to our Savi∣our,


Forty and six years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in
three days?
 So that all their endevours can not conform those numbers
to 
Zorobabels
 Temple, which had not so many years spent in the erection
thereof. Wherefore for the main they plead, that 
malice hath a wide mouth,

and loves to outlash in her relations. So that the 
Iews
 stood not exact∣ly
on the 
particulars
 of years, whilest the 
totall sum
 of their intent was to
cast a greater odium on Christ, by widening the disproportion between

so many
 years, and 
so few
 days. Yea, seeing at the same time they wilfully
mistook the meaning of our Saviours words, no wonder if withall
they corrupted the computation of the building of the Temple, adding
moe years thereunto, then were in the true account thereof.


§ 6. But be the years moe or less,
 at last after many stops, stays; demurs,
delays; suspensions, relaxations; desertions, resumptions thereof, the
building was compleated, and a solemn sacrifice at the dedication there∣of,
but far inferiour to 
Solomons,
 on the same occasion.


1 King. 8. 63.
 
And Solomon offered a sacrifice
of peace-offerings, which he offered
unto the Lord, two and twenty
thousand oxen, and an hundred
and twenty thousand sheep.
Ezra 6. 17.
 
And they offered at the dedication of this house
of God, an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams,
four hundred lambes; and for a sin-offering for all
Israel twelve hee-goats, according to the number
of the Tribes of Israel.

See here a great fall, but the second sacrifice was suitable to their small
substance: of a little they gave a little to that God, who, where there is

 
first a willing minde, accepteth it according to that a man hath, and not according
to that a man hath not.
 However, we must congratulate the hopefull men∣tion
of the twelve Tribes of 
Israel.
 Welcome happy name, and number,
well met in holy writ, seeing so long since last we parted from you,
some hundred years agoe, when 
Elias
 offered his sacrifice on mount

 
Carmell.
 A strong presumption, that some of each Tribe were now pre∣sent,
at the finishing of this Temple, whereof largely before.


§ 7. This Temple was afterwards miserably defaced,
 and profaned
by wicked 
Antiochus,
 untill some years after, 
Iudas Maccabeus
 cleansed the
Sanctuary, repaired the breaches of the Temple, renewed the gates and
chambers about it, and deckt the
 forefront thereof with crowns of
gold. He ordained also in the moneth 
Casleu
 an
 annuall festivall 
by the
space of eight days to be kept with mirth and gladness.
 Some will say, this was
but a ceremonious supererogation of 
Maccabeus,
 in making such an or∣dinance;
seeing, neither 
Hezekiah,
 when purging the Temple from the
profanation of 
Ahaz;
 nor 
Iosiah,
 cleansing it from the idolatrous pol∣lutions
of 
Manasses
 and 
Ammon,
 instituted any such yearly solemnity in
memoriall thereof. But, let such know, that under 
Antiochus
 there was
not onely a suspension, and interdiction of the Temple from pious uses,
but a totall alienation thereof from piety, and diversion to profaneness:


and by 
Maccabeus
 the old Altar was not (as by 
Hezekiah,
 and 
Iosiah
) re∣conciled
to Gods service, but a
 new one erected (hence perchance the
feast was called 
Encaenia,
 or the 
Renewing
) in the place thereof▪ And what,
if in this particular point 
Maccabeus
 was more pious then either 
Hezeki∣ah,

or 
Iosiah,
 let not his memory fare the worse, for endevouring the
better to preserve Gods favours in the memories of others.


§ 8. Just (no doubt) were the considerations moving 
Maccabeus
 to
make this annuall festivall,
 seeing our Saviour in the Gospell
 graced
this feast of the dedication with his presence. Although it appears not in
Scripture, that Christ went up purposely to 
Ierusalem
 for the observation
thereof (as he did to the Passeover, which was of divine appointment)
but there might be a casuall coincidence of this feast, and his presence at

Ierusaem.
 However, seeing Christ with his company adorned a
 
marriage∣feast

at 
Cana
 in 
Galilee,
 being a meeting of meer civil concernment, founded
on no divine command, but onely the commendable custome of the
Countrey, no wonder if he honoured the feast of 
Dedication
 with his
person, wherein the Temple was at first in some sort remarried to the
proper use thereof, from which by the profaneness of persecutours it had
formerly been divorced.


§ 9. Here I must not omit the 
Rhemists
 note,
 
Christ
 (say they) 
vouch∣safed
to honour, and keep that feast instituted by Iudas Maccabeus, Lib. 1 cap. 4.
and now Hereticks vouchsafe not to pray, and sacrifice for the dead,
 
used and appro∣ved
by him.
 But, Christ his presence at this feast of 
Maccabeus
 his institu∣tion,
doth no more oblige us to an universall observation of all the
actions of 
Maccabeus,
 without farther examination of them, how well
they agree with Gods word; then his 
eating of bread
 in the house, and
at the invitation of 
Simon the
 
Pharisee,
 engageth us to avouch all the opi∣nions,
or practise all the traditions, which the said 
Simon
 might erroni∣ously
maintain.






CHAP. IV. Of the Utensils in Solomons, wanting in this Temple.


§ 1. AS for bulk of fabrick,
 and beauty of frame: so also for varie∣ty,
and richness of furniture, this Temple fell short of 
Solo∣mons.

Indeed, great was divine providence in preserving the
Utensils of the Temple, during the captivity in 
Babylon.
 Though 
Bel∣shazzar


 drank in the holy vessels, yet his sacrilegious 
swallow
 was not so

wide,
 as to devoure the metall thereof. These remained in the treasury,
and were afterwards restored to the 
Iews
 at their return, even vessels of
gold and silver, to the full number of
 
five thousand and four hundred.
 And
yet notwithstanding the restitution of them, this 
widow-Temple,
 as I may



erm it, fell in beauty short of the 
Virgin-Temple,
 wanting many eminent
ornaments which were found in 
Solomons.


§ 2. First, it is probable,
 that the stately
 scaffold of brass, with the
Kings
 pillar (which some conceive set thereupon) in nature of a roy∣all
throne, was not in the second Temple; so glorious a Sphere being
needless, when there was no Sun to shine therein. Certainly this wan∣ted



1 The two fair pillars of 
Iachin
 and 
Boaz▪
 broken in pieces by 
Ne∣buchadnezzar,

to make them the more portable to 
Babylon,
 other∣wise
such mountains of massie brass, were unmanageable, till
par
elled into many fragments, past possibility of being rejointed
together, whilest all the lesser vessels were preserved whole and
entire. Thus, greatness oft-times exposeth eminent persons to
their own destruction, whilest poverty carrieth its own protecti∣on,
and inferiour people are preserved by their meanness.


2 The great
 
Molten Sea,
 which being guilty of the same crime (its
own overgreatness) suffered the same execution with the 
brasen
pillars.


3 The fire from heaven, which, as in the
 
Tabernacle,
 so in 
Solomons

Temple
 
came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offerings, and
the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the house.
 No spark of this fire
appeared in the second Temple.


4 The 
Pot of
 
Manna,
 spilt, broken, or lost by some accident un∣expressed
in Scripture.


5 The
 
Rod of Aaron which budded,
 but now was withered away (by
some casualty unrecorded) during the cap
ivity of 
Babylon.


6 The 
Ar
e of the Covenant.
 Not, that we give any heed to 
Ieremy
 his
Apocryphall
 hiding thereof in mount 
N
o;
 but, wheresover
it was, it was not in the second Temple.


7 The 
t
o tables of the
 
Law
 written by Gods own finger, and put
formerly into the 
Arke of the Covenant.



Here for the main we may observe, that the 
Holy of 
olies
 in this second
Temple, was left altogether empty, and unfurnished. Such avoidance
of the Utensils thereof being purposely made to make room for the
coming of our Saviour the true 
High-priest,
 who with his gracious pre∣sence
 
filleth all in all.


§ 3. As for the 
Oracle,
 if it were present in this Temple in substance,
it was absent in effect, because dumbe, and speechless, as
 
Iosephus
 both
ingenuously 
, and conscienciously rendereth a reason thereof;
affirming that the stones therein ceased to send forth their wonted splen∣dour
(by which formerly answers were returned) two hundred years
befo
e he wrote his book, 
God being angry 
ith his people for their pre
ari
ati∣on
from his law.
 And thus this second Temple was, 
s in her struc
ure, so
in her ornaments much 
 to that first of 
Solomo
 
.



§ 4. All these defects notwithstanding,
 in one eminent respect this
Temple equalled, yea excelled 
Solomons;
 according to the
 Prophets pre∣diction,

The glory of this latter house shall be greater then of the former, saith the
Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, 
aith the Lord of hosts;
 so that
in a mysticall respect, the pavement of this, was higher then the roof of
the other. For, hereon our Saviour, when a child, was presented to
the Priests; when a youth, disputed with the Doctours; when a man,
wrought many miracles, preached many Sermons; teaching with∣in,
and tempted without the Temple, on a pinnacle thereof. In a
word, 
Solomons
 Temple, like Mans originall creation in purity,
and perfection, was most glorious in it self: this latter, like our
state of regeneration, which, though full of faults, failings, wants, weak∣nesses,
in comparison of the former, yet outstrips it in Gods gra
ious ac∣ceptance
thereof, crowning it with perseverance here, and happiness
hereafter.


§ 5. So much for the Temple it self,
 which also was guarded with
Courts attending the same. Witness 
Nehemiah
 reporting, how, at the

feast of Tabernacles,
 the people, to testifie their joy, 
made themselves booths,
 or

arbours, in the
 
Courts of the house of God.
 But, whereas 
Ez
a
 mentioneth the

 
street of the house of God,
 (whither all the people repaired, being about
to reforme their strange marriages) I take this to be no part, or parcell
of the structure of the Temple, but some fair street in 
Ierusalem,
 leading
thereunto: as 
Temple-gate,
 and 
street
 in 
Bristol,
 so termed, because in
passage to the fair Church called the 
Temple
 therein.


§ 6. Let not the Reader here expect from me, a draught of 
Zorobabels

Temple.
 For, besides that already I have dipped my fingers deep enough
in 
holy mortar,
 (when describing 
Solomons
 Temple) we have nothing out
of 
Scripture,
 for the particular fashion thereof. To frame it therefore ac∣cording
to conjecturall fancies, would be as much offensive to any con∣sciencious
writer, as little satisfactory to the judicious Reader thereof.
Onely in lieu of 
Zorobabels
 we present here the 
Herodian Temple,
 and all
the Courts thereof (the same in all essentials with 
Zorobabels
) as 
Herod

rebuilt it, although the story thereof be incumbred with many impro∣babilities,
which we come now to relate.






CHAP. V. Herod (saith Josephus) plucked down, and 
 built
Zorobabels Temple.


§ 1. IT is strange,
 how the worst of Tyrants sometimes stumble on
eminent actions, doing such works as might beseem be
ter men
to be the authours thereof. Either, out of the 
love of variety,
 that being


long wearied with a constant course of wickedness, they adventure on
some commendable deeds, meerly for recreation. Or else, onely 
se de∣fendendo,
for their own security,
 to fence themselves against the too just as∣sault
of peoples tongues, hoping in vain, by one good, to make amends
for many evill deeds they have committed. Some such consideration
put 
Herod the King
 upon the building of the Temple, who (as
 
Iosephus

reports) plucked down 
Zorobabels
 Temple to the ground, and erected a
new one in the room thereof, of greater art, and larger dimensions.


§ 2. But some
 Authors of very good account, are very loth to give
credence hereunto, utterly denying 
Herod
 to have 
built,
 and 
lanched a new
vessell of a Temple,
 although allowing him, to have 
carined, new rigged,
 and
repaired the old, and especially the south-porch thereof. They conceive
this third Temple meerly modelled, and made by the fancy of 
Iosephus,
 as
which never had other then paper-wals, inke-mortar, and quil-timber in
his book-description thereof. Yea are bold to call it 
commentum, figmentum;
fabulam,
 and in downright terms 
mendacium,
 the 
flat lie
 of 
Iosephus.


§ 3. For mine own part,
 after very much reluctancy, I am at last con∣tented
to credit 
Iosephus
 herein, though willingly I could have wished,
that some other ancient Authour of his own age had avouched the same,
that so 
in the mouth of two witnesses this
 
truth might have been established.
 For, this
is that same 
Iosephus
 whom the great
 
Scaliger
 charactereth 
Diligentissimum


 
omnium Scriptorum, cujus fides & eruditio in omnibus elucet.

And, although we come not just up to this so high a commendation of
him, yet we will not suspect him of falshood in such passages, wherein he
dissenteth not from Scripture.


§ 4. For,
 first herein he himself could not be deceived in a matter no∣toriously
known, some being alive who could remember 
Herods
 buil∣ding
thereof. And 
Iosephus
 himself had often personally officiated in this
Temple, in his Priestly function. Nor, would he deceive others by such
a report; for, 
cui bono,
 what could he gain thereby? Nothing could be
gotten by flattering the dust, or ghost of 
Herod;
 especially none of his
linage (when 
Iosephus
 wrote) being in power, or place to reward him.
How can we then in charity conceive, that he did 
transgress without a cause?

Seeing there were so many of his own countreymen, living in all lands,
ready to confute so lowd a lie, if avouched by him.


§ 5. Secondly,
 the words of the Disciples to our Saviour,
 
Master,
see what stones, and what buildings are here,
 must in probability relate to
some new, sp
cious, eye-pleasing fabrick. And, if any should say, that
the Disciples, being poor fisher-men, and untravelled into forein parts,
might be priviledged to wonder at a fabrick, not so admirable in it self;
let such know, we collect the magnificence of this Temple, not so
much from their admiration, as from Christ his concession; who
(though reproving the Apostles carnall affections) alloweth the stateli∣ness
thereof in that sharp 
return,
 
Seest thou
 




these great buildings?
 Now, this could not well agree with 
Zorobabels

Temple, being little curious when new, & almost contemptible when old
(if standing in Christs time, weather-beaten after four hundred years
continuance) and therefore undoubtedly relates to the 
Herodian
 Tem∣ple,
as then in the prime, and perfection thereof.


§ 6. Adde hereunto,
 that 
Herod
 his wholly taking down, and re∣building
this Temple, is embraced, and beleeved, by most ancient, and
learned writers,
 
Hegesippus,
 Saint 
Hierome,
 
Rupertus,
 and many other
Christian Authours.
 And that some Talmudists acknowledge

Herods
 Temple, a learned Critick hath sufficiently cleared the same.
Yea, which is much materiall (even by the confession of such
 as lately
have opposed it) 
mille quingentis annis nemo vocavit in dubium, nemo non credidit;

for fifteen hundred years (since 
Iosephus
 wrote it) none ever doubted,
or questioned the truth thereof.






CHAP. VI. Objections to the contrary answered.


§ 1. HAving thus brought our beliefe (not over forward in it self)
to 
answer the spur,
 in what 
Iosephus
 reports, we confess not∣withstanding,
many shrewd objections may be alleadged
to the contrary, which we shall endevour to satisfie in order, as fol∣loweth.


§ 2. 
Ob.
 It is utterly improbable,
 that God who refused 
Davids
 tender to
build him a Temple, meerly because he was a 
man
 
of bloud,
 would ac∣cept
of such a Tyrant as 
Herod
 was, for the same purpose. Who had
murthered 
Hircanus
 his patron, 
Ioseph
 his own uncle, 
Aristobulus
 his bro∣ther-in-law,

Mariamme
 his wife, 
Aristobulus
 the younger, 
Alexander,
 and

Antipater
 his sons. In a word, unlikely it is, his service should be employ∣ed
in building the 
Temple of God,
 who endevoured to destroy the
 
God of
that Temple.


§ 3. 
Ans.
 Gods ways are in the deep, past mans finding, or fathoming
out: who, to shew the fulness of his power, and freedome of his
pleasure, useth variety in his own working. That shall be sometimes a
bar to one, which otherwhiles shall be no hinderance to another. Who
knowes not, but 
Cyrus
 was a cruell man, the manager of mighty wars,
who came to a wofull and violent death? Witness, when
 
Tomyris

the 
Scythian
 Queen, having cut off his head, and put it into a vessell of
bloud, 
Satia te
 (saith she) 
sanguine quem semper sitisti, Cloy thy self with bloud
which thou hast always thirsted after.
 And yet God accepted of the service
of 
Cyrus,
 not onely to be a benefactour unto, but founder of his Temple,
the
 
expences thereof being given out of his own house.
 Why then might not
the same God make use of 
Herod,
 for the rebuilding of his Temple,
when in continuance of time, much run into dilapidations?



§ 4. 
Ob.
 The Temple extant in our Saviours time, was forty six years in
building, as the
 
Iews
 did avouch; now, this cannot be applied to 
He∣rods

Temple, who reigned in all but thirty seven years; it must there∣fore
belong to 
Zorobabels,
 the building whereof was so long suspended,
through the frequent opposition of their enemies.


§ 5. 
Ans.
 It cannot well be applyed to 
Zorobabels,
 but exactly fits 
Herods

Temple; for 
Zorobabels
 it falls out too large, which makes expositours
take refuge at severall shifts, as we have formerly
 observed. It is ade∣quate
unto 
Herods
 Temple, the Greek being 
, the first 
Aorist
passive,
 that is, 
it hath been in building.
 For, from the time that the first
foundation was laid by 
Herod,
 untill the present instant of the 
Iews
 their
speech, the sum of forty six years was exactly compleated, all which
time (though the main of the fabrick was finished in the first eight
years, and an half) workmen were constantly employed in trimming,
polishing, and perfecting the out-buildings thereof.


§ 6. 
Ob.
 The Prophet
 
Haggai
 foretold, that the glory of the second
Temple should be greater then the first, which was accordingly accom∣plished
in the coming of our Saviour, gracing it with his
 presence,
and preaching therein. Now, if the Temple extant in our Saviours
time, were not the same numericall, individuall Temple, which 
Zoro∣babel

built, but another new one of 
Herod
 his erection, the Prophesie of

Haggai
 took no effect, and missed of the due performance thereof.


§ 7. 
Ans.
 
Haggai
 his prophesie found the full accomplishment thereof,
in our Saviours preaching in 
Herods
 Temple, which was no distinct,
but in all essentialls the self same with 
Zorobabels.
 The 
holy riddle
 in the

Revelation
 is very hard to be understood, how the 
beast
 
was the eight, and
yet one of the seven.
 But here it is obvious to any apprehension, that this was
the 
third,
 and yet the 
second Temple,
 set up in the same place of the for∣mer.


§ 8. 
Ob. Zorobabels,
 or the 
second Temple
 may as properly be termed the

first,
 and avouched the same with 
Solomons,
 as this third of 
Herods
 building
may be called the 
second
 Temple, and maintained the same with 
Zoroba∣bels.

For, it was erected on the same Area, or 
floor,
 and had, though less
limbs (smaller dimensions) the self same vitals, all the essentiall Utensils
of the first Temple, restored unto it.


§ 9. 
Ans.
 Not so, for, not a foot of stone, or inch of timber used in 
Solo∣mons,

was found in 
Zorobabels,
 which being all utterly destroyed, new
materials were fetched from mount
 
Lebanon.
 Whereas no doubt 
He∣rod

made use of whatsoever was firm, sound, and undecayed in 
Zoro∣babels

Temple. Besides, there was an interstitium, or distance of seven∣ty
years, between the destruction of 
Solomons,
 and erection of 
Zorobabels

Temple; whereas here no vacancy at all, the service, and sacrifices to
God being continued without any interruption. As therefore that man,
who, out of a desperate consumption, by Gods blessing, physick, and


good diet, recovers new flesh, remains still the same man: so 
Zoroba∣bels

Temple, acquiring by 
Herods
 bounty more beauty, and bigness,
continued the same Temple, Gods unintermitted service (the life and
soul thereof) preserving the 
individuity,
 or 
oneness
 of this Temple
with the former.


§ 10. 
Iosephus
 himself elsewhere confesseth (as learned
 
Grotius
 doth
observe) that the Temple was never but twice demolished,
 first by 
Ne∣buchadnezzar,

and finally by the 
Romans.


§ 11. Understand him (to reconcile him to himself) never but twice
demolished in anger from enemies,
 whereas 
Herod destruebat animo re∣struendi,

destroyed it with intent to rebuild it. As the Chirurgion, who, not
out of cruelty, but pity, breaks an ill set bone, with full intent to set it
better. Hence it was, that this third Temple, in some sense, is always
accounted, reputed, and esteemed by the Jewish Rabbins, the same
with the second.






CHAP. VII. Generall observables in Herods building.


§ 1. THus satisfied for the main,
 that 
Herod
 rebuilt 
Zorobabels

Temple, come we to some memorable observables therein,
gathered out of 
Iosephus,
 whose single band if the Reader
shall refuse to accept, we can tender him no better, yea, no other securi∣rity.
It is not therefore expected, that all which 
Iosephus
 relates, should
be credited in the full latitude thereof, it is enough if the judicious Rea∣der
(with
 Saint 
Paul
 in another case concerning the reports of the

Corinthians
) doth 
partly beleeve it.


§ 2. First, to satisfie, and content the 
Iews
 (half suspecting his
power, or pleasure to rebuild the Temple) he plucked not down
the old Temple, till all necessaries for the new one were perfectly
provided, and brought in place, ready to be set up, lest otherwise be∣tween
two Temples, none at all should be left. Such as take down one
Church, before fully furnished for the setting up of a new, make a dan∣gerous
breach for profaneness, and Atheisme to enter in thereat. No such

regnum
 for Satan, as in the 
interregnum
 between two religions.


§ 3. As for the dimensions of 
Herods
 Temple in relation to 
Solomons,

the ensuing parallel thus presents them unto us,

1 King. 6. 2.
 
And the house which King Solomon built for
the Lord, the length thereof was threescore cu∣bits,
and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and
the height thereof thirty cubits—[after the first

 measure] the porch therein was an
 hundred
and twenty cubits high.
Iosephus Anti. Iud. lib. 15. cap. 14.
 
Her
d removed the old foundations, and
laying new ones, built the Temple an hundred
cubits long, so many and twenty more, in height;
as for the breadth (omitted by Flavi
 Ios
phus)
Ben-Gori
n addeth, it was an hundred cu∣bits.

Not that the whole body of 
Herods
 Temple was an hundred and twe
ty


cubits high, but onely the middle thereof, as 
Iosephus
 confesse
h, the
sides round about being lower. Thus whilest 
Solomons
 Temple was
builded long ways, with the porch, or to wer at the east end, 
Herods
 ap∣pears
more round, with a tower in the middle thereof.


§ 4. Now,
 though the length, and breadth of 
Herods
 Temple exceeds

Solomons,
 (as they make it) yet certainly, no
 cubits of the 
first measure,

but common ones are meant by 
Iosephus,
 as may appear by the vast pro∣portion
of firme stones employed in this building, being 
twenty five cubits
long, eight high, and twelve broad.
 Oh! with what art, or engines were they
brought hither? If the stones on 
Sarisbury
 plain, in a levell and flat Coun∣trey,
and not above twenty miles from the sea, are recounted amongst
the wonders of 
England,
 for their conveyance thither (though the biggest
of them called 
Corse stones
 are far
 less) I say, if they be beheld with such
admiration, that judicious men resolve them not reall, but factitious
stones, of grit cemented with some unctuous matter, how can we con∣ceive
that these solid stones (four of them being the ful length of the Tem∣ple)
were managed hither, farther off from the sea, over a mountainous
Countrey? However, that great, and goodly stones were here, the

 
 and 
 in the Disciples observation,
 doth sufficient∣ly
prove.


§ 5. The 
Holy of Holies
 had the inside thereof made onely by the
Priests (others not presuming to come on the ground) whereof a thou∣sand
were found very cunning in building.
 Now, although Saint 
Paul

was a Pharisee, and a
 
tent-maker
 (the principles of that sect annexing
some trade to their profession) it is strange, so many Priests, though
skilfull in the 
Mathematicall,
 should be so dexterous in the 
manual
 part
thereof. The pinnacles of the Temple (saith 
Iosephus
) were made so
sharp, that a bird could not sit on them, to prevent the defiling thereof.
Wherefore when the Devill set our Saviour on
 a 
pinnacle of the Temple,

(where no doubt his feet stood fast without any miracle, which the
Devill could not, and Christ would not causlesly work, as presumption
against the will of his Father) we understand thereby, not such a sharp

pinnacle,
 but some 
bartlement, wing,
 or 
brink,
 of building,
higher then the
rest of the fabrick.


§ 6. It was finished (of all the days of the year) on 
Herods
 birth-day,

and therefore (saith 
Iosephus
) the joy was the greater, two such eminent
causes thereof meeting together. In very good time no doubt. Indeed
the memories of 
Philip
 and 
Iacob;
 or, of 
Simon & Iude,
 have been anciently
celebrated on the same day, being paires of pious persons well agreeing a∣mongst
themselves. But,
 
What communion hath light with darkness?
 Hea∣ven,
with hell; 
God
 with 
Herod,
 that they should be coupled together,
in the same solemnity? However, the finishing of the Temple on 
He∣rods
birth-day,
 was a better deed then what his grand-child 
Herod 

did many years after, on his
 
birth-day,
 beheading 
Iohn
 the 
B
ptist.
 The


same authour reports they had it by tradition, that it never rained on the
day-time, but onely by night, during the building of the Temple,
that so the labour of the workmen might not be interrupted.


§ 7. But a more improbable passage falls from the pen of 
Iosephus,


 when he reports, that the Temple when finished, sunk down twenty
cubits in the foundation, which the skilfull in Architecture will hiss at as
an untruth. For,



1 Strange that all parts thereof (as if by mutuall consent) should at
once equally sink directly down, such an even, and eminent
proportion; the same weight above meeting with just the same
weakness beneath, and no more in one place, then another. And
grant, the walls all agreed to sink together, it is much,
the beams were not broken with the sudden subsidency of the
building.


2 Such a sinking fabrick would have frighted the Priests from offi∣ciating
therein, and death hanging over their heads disturbed
their devotion.


3 The same authour reports, that the 
Holy of Holies
 in 
Herods
 Tem∣ple
was just twenty cubits high. If so, then by the sinking of this
fabrick, it was wholly swallowed in the earth, turned into a cel∣lar,
so that the High-Priest, in Scripture phrase, must not 
go up,

but 
go down
 unto it.


4 The Disciples, when gazing on the
 greatness of the stones,
might better have bestowed their wonder, that so firm a fabrick
should stand on so fleeting a foundation.



Wherefore with the sinking of his Temple, 
Iosephus
 his cred it sinkes
twenty cubits in my estimation, enough almost to make one un-believe
whatsoever he hath formerly reported therein.


§ 8. But admit it done,
 not suddenly, but leasurely, and by insensi∣ble
degrees, sinking some cubits more or less, was not the hand of God
more immediately therein? Partly to punish 
Herods
 pride; shewing,
he rather permitted, then approved, such a wretched Tyrant should
build his Temple. Partly, to prognosticate the future ruine of this fa∣brick,
not standing full fourscore years, before it was destroyed. How∣ever,
in a spirituall sense, the true 
Zion,
 and Church of God hath the

 
foundations thereof in the holy mountains—The highest himself shall establish her,
God is in the
 midst of her, she shall not be moved.






CHAP. VIII. Herods Temple many degrees short of Solomons.


§ 1. BUt here we must have an abominable falshood of 
Ioseph Ben∣Gorion,


 posted, and pillored, impudently affirming, that the

Herodian
 Temple was a more gorgeous structure, then that of 
Solomons;



flatly against the Scripture it self, which presenteth 
Solomons
 as a 
None∣such,

or peerless structure, (admitting no equall, much less a superiour)

exceeding
 magnificall, of fame, and of glory throughout all countreys.
 But let us
put the builders, and their buildings into the 
ballance,
 whilest the Rea∣der
is requested to hold the 
beam
 with an unpartiall hand.







1 
Solomon
 was a mighty Monarch, subordi∣nate
to God alone, having many tributa∣ry
Kings homagers
 unto him.


2 He had wealth at will, God promising
there 
should not
 be any amongst the Kings
like unto him all his days;
 and had his ships
from 
Tarshish,
 and 
Ophir,
 bringing him
abundance of treasure.


3 He employed
 an hundred forty three
thousand three hundred for seven years in
the building of the Temple.






1 
Herod
 was a King 
by the Courtesie of
Rome,
 and accountable unto 
Augustus

the Emperour.


2 
Herod
 (whilest 
Solomon
 was a Mer∣chant
royall) was so poor a Pedler, that
he turned the basest of theeves, and (as

Iosephus
 reporteth) robbed the sepulchre
of 
David
 f
r treasure hid therein.


3 
Herod
 used eleven thousand men, and a
thousand carts, eight years and an half,
in the erection of his building.







Whosoever seriously considers the premisses, and remembers the words
of
 
Zalmunna
 to 
Gideon, for as the man is, so is his strength,
 (actions bear pro∣portion
to the power of their actours) will conclude; 
Herod,
 though

urnamed 
the great,
 was too little to match, and far less to surpass 
Solomon

in such undertakings.


§ 2. As for 
Ioseph Ben-Gorion
 extolling the 
Herodian,
 above 
Solomons
 Temple
for sumptuousness, his judgement is 
lighter then vanity it self.
 In al controver∣sies
Gods law provided, that the
 
cause of both parties should come before the Iudges.

But, 
Ioseph Ben-Gorion
 (no news for them who know least to censure
most) never saw either Temple, and yet is bold to pass censure on both.
Indeed the aged Fathers that
 wept, saw two Temples, 
Solomons
 before
the destruction, and 
Zorobabels
 at the foundation thereof. 
Flavius Iosephus

the 
Iew
 saw one (
Zorobabels
 rebuilt by 
Herod
) in his time rased by the

Romans; Ben-Gorion
 beheld no 
pinnacle
 of either being a late authour,
living some hundreds of years since our Saviour. Yea (what the maid
said to Saint 
Peter
)
 
his speech agreeth thereunto,
 discovering himself a more
modern writer, by mentioning the name, and nation of the
 
Franks,
 a
word not appearing in the world till some hundreds of years after our
Saviour. Besides, the book of 
Ben-Gorion
 like 
Geryon
 (the famous mon∣ster
amongst the Poets) consisteth of three bodies confounded into one;
pieces of 
Hegisippus,
 parcels of 
Russinus,
 and patches of his own fancying,
so jumbled together, that little truth, and less certainty can be extracted
from it.


§ 3. Here we must know,
 that such as advance 
Herods
 above 
Solomons

Temple, for the beauty thereof, drive on a dangerous 
Iewish
 design.

Late
 anguis in herba, there is a pad in the straw,
 and invisible mischief lurking
therein. Hoping hereby literally to verifie the Prophesie of 
Haggai,
 of the

glory of the second Temple,
 in that carnall, materiall bravery, which 
Heroa

bestowed upon it, so to frustrate, and defeat the spirituall sense of those
predictions, mystically accomplished in the coming of Christ. Where∣fore,


all Christians are highly concerned to be zealous, to detect and de∣test
an opinion, so destructive to the truth of Scripture, and derogatory
to the glory of God.


§ 4. However,
 we deny not, but that this 
Herodian Temple
 in it self
considered, without relation to 
Solomons,
 was a magnificent structure,
(as
 
Tacitus,
 an heathen, and no friend to the Jewish nation, doth confess;)
and I beleeve that the 
Courts
 on all sides thereof took up a greater com∣pass
and circuit of gronnd, then those of 
Solomons,
 the 
Mount of the house

(narrow in his days) being afterwards much enlarged. Therein we
take principall notice of two eminent braveries. First, the 
Golden
Vine
 ornamentall thereunto, which had clusters thereon as big as
the stature of a man, as if corrivals in greatness to those 
bunches
of
 grapes,
 the spies anciently brought as a sample of the fruitfulness of
the land of 
Canaan:
 This 
Vine Ben-Gorion
 makes of massie gold, whilest
a learned
 authour, out of 
Flavius Iosephus,
 proves it to have been onely
woven of gold threed, which much abateth the price thereof. But,
whilest 
Iews
 gaze with admiration on the cost, and curiosity of this

Golden Vine,
 Christian eyes may better behold another, of more grace, and
glory, often to be seen in the same Temple, even 
Him
 that said,
 
I am the
true Vine, and my Father is the husbandman.


§ 5. The other was that 
Golden
 Eagle,
 set over the entrance of the
Temple, which afterwards proved a 
Bird of prey
 to the poor 
Iews,
 occasi∣oning
a grievous slaughter amongst them. Who conceiving their Tem∣ple
profaned by this Image, brake forth into a mutiny thereupon, where∣in
they were slain in great numbers. Threefold was the offence, the 
Iews

took at the making thereof, because



1 Scandalous, to set up any image in the Temple, as introductory
to Idolatry.


2 Unbeseeming the state of 
Gods house,
 like an Inne to have a sign
hung out of it.


3 The 
Eagle
 being the 
Roman Armes
 minded them of their sub∣jection.



An ungratefull spectacle to the Jewish nation (so constant a pretender
to freedome) to be daily upbraided with their loss of liberty.


§ 6. To conclude, and give 
Herod
 his due, this 
third-second Temple
 (as
I may term it) though far short of 
Solomons,
 may be believed more ma∣gnificent
then 
Zorobabels.
 So that, what 
Hezekiah
 ingenuously confessed of
the Kings of 
Assyria,
 may as justly be affirmed of 
Herod, Of a truth he hath
done great matters.
 Though, who had not rather have one line of 
Iosiahs

Epitaph, written truly on his tombe,
 
The rest of his acts, and his goodness,

then all the popular applause 
Herod
 received, for erecting this magni∣ficent
structure.








CHAP. IX. The Actions of Christ in the Temple.


§ 1. WE have tendered to the view of the reader,
 in our lastmap,
the draught of 
Zorobabels
 Temple as repaired & enlarged
by 
Herod,
 so as the learned, and pious 
Ludovicus
 Capellus

hath presented it, who exactly took his instructions therein, from the pen
of 
Iosephus,
 an eye-witness hereof. Wherefore I justly disingage my self
from all objections against this Map, which are properly chargeable
upon 
Capellus
 his account. I confess, herein I proceed not with that

, and 
, with that boldness and assurance, which I could
desire; because the divisions and dimensions of the Courts, and cham∣bers,
as exhibited in this Temple, rely not (as 
Solomons
) on Gods word,
but onely on humane fallible testimony. Oh it is excellent, when,
with 
Theophilus,
 we may know 
the
 certainty of those things wherein we are
instructed
 out of Scripture it self.


§ 2. Come we now to the actions of our Saviour in the Temple;

having first premised this usefull, yea necessary distinction. What our
English tongue, for want of another proper word, promiscuously cal∣leth

the Temple,
 the originall carefully expresseth by two names, ade∣quate
to two severall parts thereof,





.This properly was the covered part of the
Temple (from 
 to inhabite,
 God peculi∣arly
dwelling there) consisting of the 
P
rch,
Holy,
 and 
Holy of Holies,
 with the chambers
about them. Into this 
Christ
 never came,
(though 
Zachariah
 in his course did, to 
ffer

 incense
) nor by the law (
under which he was
made,
 as not coming to 
destroy,
 but
 
fulfill

it) might he enter thereinto; proper onely
for the Priests to officiate therein. Yet though
not his 
person
 whilest living, his 
power
 when
dying, penetrated this Temple, namely,
when he rent the
 
vaile,
 thereby mystically
opening an entrance into heaven by the merit
of his passion.


.Containing all the verge and com∣pass
of the Courts about the Tem∣ple,
and within the outward 
Sept

thereof. Christ constantly came hi∣ther,

I ever taught
 (saith he) 
in
 the
Temple:
 understand him, that he ne∣ver
wilfully affected 
Conventicles,
 as
ashamed of his doctrine, or willingly
declined the Temple, when affor∣ded
convenient entrance therein∣to.
Otherwise, he taught also on
the
 
Mount,
 in the
 
Ship,
 in 
Syna∣g
gues,

in private 
houses;
 but never
so properly in his center, as when in
the Temple.





This distinction of 
 and 
 holds current, clean through the new
Testament; save that once 
 is taken for the whole circumference
of the Temple, when 
Iudas cast down the pieces of silver
 therein: though
he stayed not long there, as out of his own element, but desperately
made haste, that he might
 
goe unto his own place.


§ 3. This distinction premised,
 we will waite on the Reader into
the Temple. First requesting him to carry competent money, and a


charitable minde along with him. For as we shall enter in at the eastern
gate, (commonly called 
Beautifull
) we shall be sure there to meet with
many creeples, and beggers of all sorts, as proper objects of his liberality.
Here daily lay that
 
lame man,
 on whom Saint 
Peter,
 though moneyless,
bestowed the bestalmes he could give, or the other receive, even the use
of his limbs.


§ 4. But now we come to the memorable passages concerning our
Saviour in the Temple. These were either done on him,
 when an
infant; or by him, when arrived to mans estate. Of the former was
his presentation by his parents to the Priest, and when an
 oblation
for his mother was made, 
a paire of Turtle-doves, and two young Pigeons.


§ 5. Hereat in-springs old 
Si
eon
 into the Temple.
 God always per∣formes
his promises with advantage. He had a revelation that he should
not die before he saw 
Christ,
 who here both saw and felt him. Oh how
he hugges him (though faster by his Faith, then) with his weake armes,
which seem the stronger for the 
Burden,
 as his dim eyes the clearer for
this 
sight!
 Yea, he petitions heaven for a Gaole-delivery,
 
Lord let thy ser∣vant
depart in peace.
 Longer life would be but longer loss, and therefore
fain would he flye 
from Christ in his armes,
 to 
the armes of Christ,
 before his
refined joy were allayed with any worldly woe. Then he addresseth
himself, with bitter-sweets, to 
Christs
 parents, neither frighting nor flat∣tering,
but plainly foretelling them, their 
child should be for the fall and rise
of many in Israel.
 Particularly, he tells 
Mary,
 that a
 
sword should pierce
through her,
 and Christ (though borne) should not die without
the pain of his mother. As if the throws, suffered by other women at the
birth, were reserved for her to endure at the death of her Son.


§ 6. 
Simeon
 is seconded by 
Anna,
 a prophetess of an hundred years old,
(temperance is the best prolonger of the candle of life) and herein she
exceeded 
Simeon.
 He came but
 
into the Temple,
 she
 
departed not from the
Temple,
 but served God therein with fasting and prayer. 
She also spake of
Christ to all that looked for redemption.
 And thus 
Christ
 was 
proclaimed
 in the

Temple
 by two 
Heralds
 of different sexes, whilest his Parents carefully
kept the copies of their severall Proclamations, as trusting them in no
other Cabinet then their own hearts.


§ 7. Now seeing it is said of 
Anna
 (pardon a short digression) that
she 
departed not from the Temple,
 it will be enquired whether any women
were constantly 
Leigers
 to live therein. Were any of the weaker sex (be∣ing
prohibited 
to speak in the Church
) permitted to live in the Temple?
For, as for the nurse of King 
Ioash,
 hid with him in the
 
house of God,

the case was extraordinary, and her clandestine condition nothing per∣tinent
to the present question. In answer whereunto: By 
never departing
thence,
 we understand her 
daily repairing thither.
 It was 
Davids
 wish, 
that he
might
 dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of his life, i. e. that he might have free
access thither upon any occasion.
 Thus the sacrifice, though onely morning, and


ing, is called a 
continuall Burnt-offe
ing.
 And thus 
Anna
 daily frequenting
the Temple, was 
continually there,
 as formerly those persons, who every
day might be found in saint. 
Pauls
 Church at 
walking-houres▪
 might in
some sort be said 
never to depart thence.


§ 8. To return to our Sa
iour,
 who hitherto appeared onely passive
in the Temple, but afterwards acted miraculously therein First, when
found sitting in the middest of the Doctours, both
 
bearing them,
 and

asking them questions.
 He, who himself was 
the
 Word,
 would notwith∣standing

hear,
 before he did 
speak
 and attentively listned to the 
po∣sitions

of those Doctours, before he began his 
opposition
 against them.


§ 9. Arrived at mans estate,
 we first fix our eyes on his
 purging of
the 
Temple,
 from Dove-mongers, Mony-changers, and such as 
old
sheep and oxen therein▪ Had such Merchants, kept themselves in the

 or▪
 
sheep-market, Christ
 had never distu
bed them, who now,
with a 
scourge of small cords, drave them out of the Temple.
 Say not it was
as lawfull to sell as sacrifice cattell therein: the one being the main use
thereof, according to Gods command, the oth
r a notorious abu
 of
the 
Temple,
 turning it by fraudulent bargains into 
a den of the 


§ 10. Saint 
Hierome
 reports,
 that certain fiery
 rayes, or beams, darting
from 
Christ
 eyes, drove out these Merchants from this place. A c
ncei
,
which we dare not presently avouch for fear those 
 
of Christs scourge

flie also in our faces thereupon. For if he whipped out those Merchants,
for setting up their 
ware-houses
 in the Temple, surely he will lend a 
lash
 to
such as adde traditions to the Text. This sure we are (because recorded
in Scripture) that Christ so earnestly pursued this reformation, that 
the

 zeal of his Fathers house did eate him up.
 Understand it, that our Saviour
being truly 
Carneus
 though not 
Carnalis, of a fleshy, though no fleshly constitution,

had his body wearied out with faintness, not able in its performances,
to keep pace with the desires of his mind.


§ 11. After this time,
 many were those hea
enly Sermons; Christ
made in the Temple: which here we forbear to relate Onely we take
notice of that he preached in 
Solomons Porch
 (which afterwards deser∣ved
rather the name of 
Christs-porch, seeing a greater then Solomon 
 here
)
when the people (mysteries are blasphemies to 
) 
took up


 
stones to stone him.
 Some will a
ke, whence had they those stones? It be∣ing
unlikely that any were let to lie loose in so holy a place. But we
may be confident, if there were any to be had above ground▪ their ma∣lice
would finde them out▪ And probably they pl
cked them off from
the pavement: their furious zeal counting it a meritorious act, rathe

to 
end the
 out of the ground, then suffer a supposed blasphemer to
escape▪ Surely such stones would rather have
 spoken in his praise, then
done any thing to his prejudice, especially 
before his 
oure was come.


§ 12. And as he spake woll,
 so he did as well therein.
 
The blind and the
lame came to him in the Temple, and he healed them.
 See here, those with 



might come to him in the Temple, not those with 
Insections:
 the

lame,
 but not the 
leprous
 might enter therein. Thus whilest sufferings
and afflictions do not hinder us, sinfull pollutions do debar our access
to Gods gracious presence.


§ 13. We must not forget,
 that a little before his passion, 
Christ
 the
second time purged the Temple Three
 years since he cast all Merchants
and their appurtenances out of Gods house, which now notwithstanding
that 
ejection,
 had again gotten unlawful 
possession
 therein. Devils he cast out
of men so finally, that 
they entred no more into them;
 but wicked men, once
thrown out of the Temple, recovered their stations therein again. Abu∣ses
in the Church depart not till they are driven, and then go away un∣willingly,

animo revertendi,
 with full intent to embrace the next op∣portunity
to return. What need hath Reformation it self to be frequently
reformed, seeing corruptions will so quickly creep thereinto? Christ,
the second time, cast those vermine out of the Temple.


§ 14. Now,
 just before he took his farewell of his Fathers house, he
beheld the 
Pharisees
 casting their money into the treasury. So that the

 
Widowes mites,
 was the last object (no small credit unto her) which in
the Temple entertained our Saviours eyes on earth, and no doubt long
since hath been rewarded by him in heaven. For presently he departed
to mount 
Olivet,
 and there foretold, yea thence denounced the destructi∣on
of the Temple, which followed not many years after.






CHAP. X. The acts of the Apostles in the Temple.


§ 1. 
CHrist,
 after his ascension, resigned the 
Temple
 to his Apostles,
to supply his absence by their preaching to the people. Here
on the day of 
Pentecost
 Saint 
Peter
 made that memorable Ser∣mon,
wherein he vindicated both himself and company from the asper∣sion
of 
drunkenness,
 avouched the truth of Christs resurrection, & charged
the 
Iews
 so 
 home,
 for shedding his innocent bloud, that by the sharpness
of his reproof (
 
the words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastned by the
masters of the assemblies
) such as heard him 
were pricked in their
 heart; cry∣ing
out to Peter, and to the rest of the Apostles; Men and brethren, what shall we
doe?


§ 2. Here,
 by the peoples equall applications, and addresses to the
rest of the Apostles, it appeareth, that they were all fellow helpers, and
joint Commissioners with Saint 
Peter,
 (all in the 
Iury
 besides the 
Foreman

are not cyphers) though he for order sake, and regularity, to avoid con∣fusion,
was made the mouth for the rest. Yea, such their sobriety and


discretion, though at that instant inabled with the 
gift of tongues,
 that
they onely made use of seasonable silence (such as best know how to
speake, know best when to hold their peace) with their 
tacite suffrages

concurring to the truth of what Saint 
Peter
 delivered: who further gave
his Auditory counsell
 
TO REPENT.


§ 3. But was this well done of him to adde grief to grief?
 What, more re∣pentance
still? Why further 
pain,
 to such as were 
pricked
 to their hearts? Was
this any valour, to beat them with more blows, who already cryed out for

fair quarter, WHAT SHALL WE DOE?
 But know, 
Peter
 herein ad∣vised
them to join to their former 
legall sorrow,
 an 
evangelicall repen∣tance;

such as is attended with desire, hope, & some assurance of Pardon.
He prescribes them the same receipt, he lately took himself; having found
the good fruit thereof, when, on his hearty
 sorrow, he obtained pardon
for denying his Master. No Sermons so soveraign, as those which proceed
from the Ministers
 
comfortable
 experience. Nor did he barely advise them
to repent, but also to
 
be baptized every one of thē, in the name of Iesus Christ &c.


§ 4. See the success of his counsell,
 
about three thousand were added to
the Church that same day.
 O high 
holy-day
 in heaven! This 
Many-Saints∣day

was a festivall of great solemnity therein, where there is
 
joy over one
sinner that repenteth,
 singing on their golden viols, 
Peter and the Apostles have
saved their three thousand.
 His Sermon (as set down) contained not so many

words,
 as it converted 
souls.
 Though surely, what we read in Saint

Luke
 was onely the breviate, sum, and abridgement of his Sermon, see∣ing,

with many
 other words did he tes
ifie and exhort.


§ 5. Many advantages concurred to render his Sermon the more
effectuall. First,
 the suffering of our Saviour was so near in place, and
late in time, that his wounds were (as I may say) still fresh bleeding in
the guilty memories of the people assembled. Secondly, the present 
mi∣racle
of tongues
 bestowed on 
Peter
 and his 
mpanions, did wonderfully
make way for the 
Word
 he delivered. Thirdly, such to whom he spake,
were
 
devout men,
 blindly pious (like Saint 
Paul
 before his conversion)
but desirous of information; zeal not being to be wrought, but
regulated, not to be new gotten, but right guided in them. Last∣ly,
and chiefly, the 
Spirit of God
 invisibly wrought on their souls. Thus
when the
 
door of utterance,
 or the
 
opened mouth of the Minister
 meets with the

 
door of Faith
 or 
entrance,
 in the
 
opened hearts
 of the people, the Word
makes miraculous improvement.


§ 6. And now our Saviour had plentifully performed his promise:

He that beleeveth on me,
 the works that I doe, shall he doe also, and greater
 works
then these shall be doe, for I goe to my Father;
 as then put into a capacity
more effectually to assist them, (as formerly but with his prayers) then au∣thoritatively
with his power. The 
Disciple,
 (by his Masters permission,
yea procurement) proved 
above his Master
 in success. Christ, all his life
long, was angling for a few fishes, but a
 
hundred and twenty,
 whilest



Peter
 comes with his Drag-net, and catcheth about 
three thousand

in one day. Amongst the reasons whereof, consider



1 
Christ
 was properly, not to be the builder, but the 
Foundation
 it
self: and therefore others were more happy in edification.


2 He was to be humbled (as with hunger, thirst, weariness, shame,
and pain, so) with the heavy afflictions of long unprofitable
preaching, because of peoples
 
unbeliefe.


3 During his life, the kingdome of heaven was but
 
at hand,
 which
after his death, and Ascension was 
in hand.
 The 
broad gates of
grace
 being then opened for multitudes to enter, where few by
especiall favour got in before by the 
Wicket.



We have insisted the longer on Saint 
Peters
 Sermon, because it is the be∣ginning
of Ecclesiasticall History after Christs ascension, which, in Gods
due time, we are in some hope to finish by his assistance. And that the
foresaid Sermon was made in the Temple, appears by the passage of
their
 
continuing daily with one accord in the Temple.
 Intimating that they
were formerly assembled in the same place.


§ 7. Pass we by the other acts of the Apostles in the Temple,
 onely
we must not omit
 
Solomons porch
 where they made their aboad. And it
is worth our inquiry where the same was placed.


§ 8. First,
 negatively, it was not that porch of 
Solomons
 (nor any other
afterwards built of the same dimensions on the same floor) mentioned
in the
 
Old Testament;
 because



1 That was a part (being the entrance) of the 
, or 
Covered
Temple:
 Into which, the disciples (being no Priests) might not
enter.


2 That porch had but
 twenty cubits in length, and ten in breadth,
being so small, that it could not contain the disciples, and their
company, being above three thousand persons.


3 That by the 
Septuagint,
 is called 
UIam
 (retaining always the He∣brew
word) not 
, as this Porch is called in the Greek
tongue.



Rather therefore, by this 
Porch,
 we understand, one 
side, square,
 or 
cloister

of the great Court about the 
Temple.


§ 9. Now seeing the same was surrounded with Courts on all sides,
the question is,
 on which side thereof 
Solomons Porch
 was placed. Here
we had been utterly at a loss, but for the seasonable help of
 
Iosephus;
The people
 (saith he) 
perswaded the King [Agrippa
 the younger] 
to repair the
east Porch or Cloister: Now this Cloister was of the outward Temple, standing
over an exceeding deep valley, raised upon a wall of four hundred cubits, which was
made of square white stones of twenty cubits long, and six cubits high a piece, the
work of King Solomon, who first built the Temple.
 Whereby it appears, that
this Porch respected the east, and was on each side of the entrance into
the Temple.



§ 10. But the greatest difficulty remains.
 How came it to be called

Solomons Porch?
 did not he equally build all the first Temple? Why there∣fore
did this Porch (as his darling) beare his name above all the rest?
And (which increaseth the difficulty) seeing all that Temple was razed
by the 
Babylonians
 (following no doubt the cruell counsell of the 
Edo∣mites,

 Down with it, down with it, even to the ground
) how came this cloister,
of the second Temple in 
Christs
 time, to retain the name of 
Solomons?


§ 11. Some conceive this part stood undemolished by the 
Babylonians:
 seeing that curse,
 
there shall not be left
 here one stone upon another, that shall
not be thrown down,
 was denounced against the second Temple, not
against 
Solomons,
 some parcell whereof might be left standing. But un∣der
favour, I conceive, it was particularly called 
Solomons-Porch,.
 because
the very bottome, or floor thereof (being forced ground) was by much
expence made by 
Solomon,
 and gained with great art and industry, from
the
 valley beneath; so that (even when the superstructure thereon was
by the 
Babylonians
 levelled to the earth) the admirable foundation, that
master-piece of art, still remained, preserved the memory, and imparted
the name of 
Solomon,
 the founder thereof, to that Cloister, which in the
second Temple, was erected upon the same.


§ 12. If any demand why the disciples made choice of this Porch,

above any other, to make their residence therein; severall considerations
might move them thereunto:



1 Because formerly handselled with our 
Saviours
 heavenly Sermon
therein.


2 Because of great capacity, conveniently to receive them, without
prejudice to other peoples passage into the Temple.


3 Because it was the first place that offered it self unto them, at their
entrance into the Temple.



Herein they observed some Analogy of 
Christs
 counsell, 
In
 what place so∣ever
yee enter into a house, there abide untill yee depart from that place.
 Thus 
Solo∣mons-porch,

being (as I may say) the first house 
in the house of God,
 into
which the disciples entered; there they fixed themselves, as no starters
and fugitives, but such as would stand to the doctrine they delivered.


§ 13. So much of 
Solomons-porch;
 onely let me adde; that 
Capellus

(herein contrary to other
 learned men) placeth 
Solomons-porch
 on the
south side of the Temple;
 mistaking it, as we believe, with 

or the 
Cloister Royall:
 which out of 
Iosephus
 indeed appears, to have been
largely built and beautified on the south-side of the Temple. However
we would not innovate or alter any thing in our map from the minde
of 
Capellus,
 though here, in our description, we presume to 
nter our dis∣senting
 from his opinion.


§ 14. Pass we by many other intermediate acts of the 
Apostles
 and

Disciples
 in the 
Temple.
 Amongst all which none might lawfully avouch
his entrance so far therein, as 
arnabas,
 being a 
Levite
 by his extraction,


and
 therefore legally priviledged in his approaches to the Altar it self.
Come we now to the last passage of Saint 
Paul
 in the Temple. Last in∣deed
it was likely to prove unto him, and he lose his life therein, on
this occasion.


§ 15. At the instance of some godly people,
 he was perswaded to pu∣rifie
himself: thereby, partly to gain on the affections of the beleeving

Iews,
 as yet zealous for the 
Law;
 partly to confute their falshood, who
traduced him for an 
Antinomian,
 against all ceremonious observances. Here∣upon
he came 
into
 the Temple to signifie the accomplishment of the days of purifi∣cation,
untill that an offering should be offered for him and his companions.
 If any
grudge that after the coming of the 
Gospel,
 so much cost should be bestow∣ed
on the 
Law,
 and sullenly say, with 
Iudas Iscariot, To what purpose is this

 wast?
 Might not the 
Law
 truly answer with our Saviour, in the same case,

 
He did it for my buriall,
 and for the more solemn interment thereof.


§ 16. But Saint 
Pauls
 devotion in performing these 
Obsequies
 was in∣terrupted
by the people,
 who accused him for defiling the Temple, 
ha∣ving

 seen Trophimus, and Ephesian, with him in the City, whom they supposed he had
brought into the Temple.
 Malicious jealousie never makes good Logician,
so strange are the inferences thereof. In vain might Saint 
Paul
 deny the
consequence of their syllogisme, whilest they were ready to prove it by
an 
inartificiall argument,
 from the 
Authority,
 or 
prevalency
 rather of a popular
uproare,
 
Some cryed one thing, some another,
 and those, no doubt, that knew
least railed loudest, and 
no certainty could be known for the tumult,
 the many-headed
multitude speaking a Language, whereof none can be an in∣terpreter,
to understand them, which understand not themselves.


§ 17. 
Suppositive
 was the offence of Saint 
Paul,
 (onely on their bare
surmise) but 
positive
 must be his punishment, drawing him out of the
Temple, whom certainly they had killed, had not the seasonable inter∣posing
of the Captain, rescued him from them. Who hence conveyed
him safe into the
 
Castle,
 no doubt, of 
Antonia
 hard by, and not the
Castle on 
Mount Sion,
 built out of the ruines of the Palace of 
David,
 though
formerly (following the authority of others) we made that place the
Theater of Saint 
Pauls
 future actions on this occasion.






CHAP. XI. Of the vast wealth of the second Temple.


§ 1. WE have cause to conceive, that the 
Corban
 or Treasury of the
second Temple was about our Saviours time,
 welnigh as
well lined with wealth, as in the reign of 
Solomon,
 flowing from three
principall springs,



1 Meer 
Gentiles.


2 Proselytes.


3 Native 
Iews.



The first of these were very bountifull to the Temple, and constantly






§ 4. Native 
Iews
 were the last,
 and best benefactours to the Temple,
especially if all contributed thereunto in proportion to the poor widow

who cast in two
 mites being all her substance.
 Now, had one been present when
the Scribes and Pharisees cast in their offerings into the treasury, it had
been pleasant to behold the conflict, betwixt their covetousness, and
vainglory, and how the latter prevailed in them. For, though they 
were

 covetous,
 yet when people beheld them, they were content to part with
their money, or rather to let it out for the interest of popular applause▪
But, besides free-will-offerings at any time, that Gods service might not
be lest arbitrary, the 
Iews
 were injoyned thrice a year
 at the solemn festi∣valls
with their men children (when able, saith the Rabbih, led in their
Fathers hands, to climbe up the mountain whereon the Temple was
built) to appear before God; where none, who hoped to return with
their hearts ful of joy, came with their hands empty of money For seeing
the 
Iews
 held their estates of no 
mean Lord,
 but all by tenure in 
capi
e
 from
the God of Heaven, these were the three solemn payments of their 
head
rent
 to their high 
Land lord.
 Besides these in the days of our Saviour, vast
were the sums which were advanced to the treasury, by that gainfull Di∣vinity
current amongst the people, though stamped onely with Pharisai∣call
traditions, of which, this one that followeth, was the most re∣markable.


§ 5. It plainly appears,
 that all children, if of ability, should maintain
their parents, if by age or accident grown weak and impotent to subsist

 of themselves, according to Gods command, 
Honour
 thy father and mother
Qamp;c.
 Notwithstanding which obligation, the Scribes and Pharisees did
preach, & teach, that in case any children were pleased to compound with

 
Corban,
 &c to pay a round sum proportionable to their estates, unto pious
uses, thereby they were disingaged in conscie
de, from making any far∣ther
provision for their poor parents▪ Going on this ground, that one debt
was to be but once satisfied, and if they paid it in to the service of God
the grand-father to all mankinde, thereby they were discharged from
duty to their immediate, and subordinate parents.


§ 6. This 
commutation-money
 (as I may term it) amounted to a 
Nem
∣scit

of revenue,
 but withall made a dearth of dutifull children in the land,
who counted it the more frugall way, once for all to fine to the Temple,
then to pay the constant rent of daily relief to their parents. But can an

Acquittance
 of 
humane, 
adition,
 be valid, against a debt of 
Specialty▪
 by

Gods command?
 Oh! had the hole in the cover of 
Corban
 been a 
mouth

to 
speak,
 as well as to take in, how zealously would it have protested a∣gainst
such proceedings? And we may conceive this one cause of hasten∣ing
the wofull ruine of the Temples wealth, such ill gotten money poi∣soning
the 
Corban,
 making it suddenly swell, and then break in pieces,
when swept away by the Romans, which we come now to relate.








CHAP. XII. The finall abolition of the Utensils of the second Temple.


§ 1. GReat houses commonly crack before they fall,
 to give the dwel∣lers
therein notice to depart. Thus before the Temple was fi∣nally
ruined, and her vessels taken away, two grand warnings were gi∣ven
the 
Iews,
 seasonably to amend, and prevent farther mischief. The
first in that famous year wherein 
Tully
 and 
Mark Antony
 were Consuls,
some sixty years before our Saviours birth, when
 
Pompey
 the great, ha∣ving
taken the City and Temple, entred the 
Holy of Holies
 with some of
his souldiers, the floor whereof had formerly felt no other feet, but those
of the high Priests, and those but once a year. Here he saw mysterious
ornaments, understanding (not the meaning but) the matter thereof to
be pure gold; a shroud bait to tempt his hungry souldiers to sacriledge,
besides two thousand talents of silver in the treasury of the Temple. On
all which he onely feasted his, and his officers eies, whilest their hands
did fast, not diminishing the least mite thereof, in veneration of that deity
to whom they did belong; Onely he took on him to restore 
Hircanus
 to
be high Priest, a presage that the Jewish Priesthood would shortly fall
down, which already did so shake, that the high Priest needed to take a

Presentation, ad corroborandum,
 from the hands of 
Pompey
 a Pagan Patron.


§ 2. Secondly,
 when 
Crassus
 that rich churl, and 
Roman
 Generall mar∣ching
with his Army into 
Syria,
 and through 
Ierusalem,
 flayed, what

Pompey
 did not fleece, spoiling the Temple to the value of eight thousand
talents. Indeed,
 
Eleazar
 keeper of the holy treasures, gave, or rather pay∣ed
to 
Crassus
 a wedge of gold weighing three hundred pounds, to ran∣some
the rest from his rapine. But the golden wedge did but widen the
covet ousness of 
Crassus,
 and like a break-fast did inable him to encoun∣ter
a dinner with a greater appetite; so that, notwithstanding his oath
to the contrary, he added sacriledge to his perjury. But seeing theeves give
whatever they take not away, we have rather cause to comend his boun∣ty,
that the golden table, candlesticks, and other ornaments escaped his
fingers; except, they were either hid from him by the carefull providence
of others, or left by him out of his own politick covetousnes, like nest-egs
to encourage others again to lay up more wealth in the same place. And
no doubt he hoped, though now he had mowed down the Temples trea∣sure
to the bare roots, shortly, when grown up again, to return to the

after-share
 thereof; but all in vain, for, marching with his Army into

Parthia,
 there 
his money perished with him,
 losing the 
principle
 of his
stoln wealth, and paying his own life for 
interest.
 Thus, those who on a
sudden grow rather foggy, then fat, by feeding on sacrilegious morsels,
do pin
 away by degrees, and die at last of incurable consumptions.


§ 3. Here we cannot but take notice,
 how profoundly shallow


the Scribes and Pharisees were, in that their superstitious Criticisme, and
leaden distinction, how he that 
swore by the Temple,
 was left at liberty,
whilest he that 
swore by the
 gold of the Temple,
 was bound up and
concluded in conscience to the performance of his oath. Whereas our Sa∣viour
demonstrateth, that 
the Temple was greater then the gold,
 as the

sanctifier
 thereof. Besides, in common sense, he should seem faster tyed,
whose faith by oath was staked down to the Temple, as to a fixt, firme,
stable structure, then he whose truth was tyed onely to the gold thereof,
a more fading, flitting, moveable matter, as appears by 
Crassus
 and others
carying so much of it away with him into forein countreys. But indeed
(as our Saviour teacheth) the main obliging power of those oaths, con∣sisted
in the presence of God, before whom they were made, who alone
is immoveable and immutable, whereas in process of time, the Temple
it self, as well as the gold thereof, came to destruction.


§ 4. 
For,
 Vespasian
 and 
Titus his son, Roman
 Emperours, 
Anno Dom. 72.

razed the Temple, and utterly confounded all the Utensils thereof. In∣deed
they were first carried in triumph to 
Rome,
 but what afterward be∣came
of them is altogether unknown. It is no sin to conceive that their
property was altered; and they either converted to coin, or turned to plate
for the use of the Emperour, or his favorites. Sure none are known to re∣main
in 
specie
 at this day: and one may wonder, that no impudent 
Relick∣monger

hath produced a golden feather of a 
Cherubims
 wing, or a 
knop,
flower, bowle,
 or 
almond
 of the 
seven-branched candle-stick,
 having pretended
since Christs time, to improbabilities of as high a nature. Strange that no
Pope hath gotten a piece of 
Aarons
 Mitre, or 
breast-plate,
 to grace his
wardrobe, or a parcell of the 
manuscript-commandements
 written by
Gods finger, to adorn his 
Vatican.
 But divine providence hath utterly ra∣zed
all foundation for superstition to build upon, in the totall abolition
of these holy ornaments. And if those reasonable 
Witnesses
 of Gods truth,
were by his permission 
overcome, and killed by the Beast, when they had finished
their
 testimony,
 no wonder if these sensless and inanimate types, having

served their generation,
 the truth being come, were finally extinguished▪
Nor have I ought else to observe of those holy Utensils, save that all were
made of pure gold, and yet the Apostle is bold to tearm them, and all
other legall ceremonies
 
beggerly elements,
 so debasing them in compari∣son
of Christ, the authour of grace, and giver of eternall life.

To the Right Honourable
FRANCIS
LORD RVSSELL,
Son to the Right Honourable
WILLIAM
EARL OF BEDFORD.


MY LORD,


P
Erusing this passage in the beginning of Saint

Lukes 
Gospell,
—To
 write unto thee in
order, most excellent Theophilus, that
thou mightest know the certainty of those
things, 
, wherein thou hast
been 
catechised, or,
 instructed: 
it furnished me with some
observables, very conducible to my present purpose;




1 
Though
 God
 alone be good, 
yet man in some sense
may be
 most excellent.


2 
Even in that age, wherein
 they had
 all things
common, 
Nobility remained
 severall, 
as appro∣priated
to some principall persons.



3 No diminution to the dignity of a Noble man, to
be cat
chised, 
, in the Principles of Re∣ligion.


4 Dedicating of Books of Noble persons is an anci∣ent
practise, 
 Scripture precedents.


5 
 not patronage
for his book (the 
Word of God
 being the
 sword of

the 
 to defend it)
but intended the instruction of 
Theophilus
 therein.



The 
 the tex
, encourg
d me, 
ing to
put forth a Treatise to publick view, to make choice of an ho∣nourable
Patron, and hope I have found a 
Theophilus
 in
your Lordship, whom I see to be 
young,
 know to be 
Noble,

and beleeve to 
e relig
ous. The 
composure
 therefore of
this ensuing bo
 (the issue by Gods 
blessing of 
 own in∣dustry)
this alone I humbly 
 to 
 Honour to pro∣tect
the same. As for the matter thereof, being wholly Scri∣pture,
I heartily 
dedicate
 your Honour thereto, to be in∣structed
therewith.


And now, my Lord, may I request you to t
ke a serious
survey of your own extraction, to be unto you a forcible motive
unto vertue. To instance onely in your deceased Ancestors (as
cut of the reach of flattery) 
John
 your Atavus by his wise∣dome,
and valour (the fortunate Generall against the Rebels
in the West) founded under God the Nobility of your fami∣ly.

Francis
 your Abavus (whose 
Hall
 seemed a 
Court, Clo∣set,

a 
Chappell,
 and 
Gate-house,
 an 
Hospitall
) shined as a
light with his piety in those darker days. 
William
 your Pro∣avus,
to whom agreed the character of 
Sergius Paulus,
 
A
prudent man, and Deputy of the Countrey,
 and that an


Island too (though not 
Cyprus,
 yet) 
Ireland
; of whose abi∣lities 
Queen Elizabeth
 was well assured, when choosing him Pilot of that leaking Land; then toffed with the violent tem∣pest of Rebellion. Francis your 
, whose death I would epithete 
Untimely
 (not onely for the behoof of his own fa∣mily, but benefit of the whole nation) did not the same autho∣rity, which reproved Saint 
Peter
 for calling that 
common
, which he had cleansed, forbid me to term any thing 
untimely
 which his Providence hath appointed.


Now, my 
Lord,
 upon a review of this your pedegree, I will
not be so Pedantick to minde you of a Grammar-instance,
to make it true construction in your Honours practise, 
Mag∣norum
haudquaquam indignus avorum;
 but in Scripture-phrase
I request you to
 
Look to the rock whence you are
hewn, and the hole of the pit whence you are digged;

and doe nothing unworthy of that honourable parentage,
whence you are derived.


Far be it from your Honour to be listed among those noble
men, of whom it may be said in a 
sad sense,
 that they are 
very
highly descended,
 as being 
come down many degrees
 from
the worth, and virtues of their noble Progenitors.


To conclude then with 
Theophilus,
 with whom I began.
It is observable of him, that though styled 
most excellent
 by
Saint 
Luke
 in his Gospell, yet in the 
Book
 of the Acts (which
was written many years after) he calls him onely
 
Theophi∣lus,

without any honourable addition. What? Had Saint

Luke
 in process of time less civility, or 
Theophilus
 (with
more age) less Nobility? Surely neither, but Saint 
Luke

may be presumed, purposely to wave his titles, out of compli∣ance
to the temper of 
Theophilus,
 who in his reduced age


grew weary of worldly pompe, more pleased to have the truth
of honour fixed within him, then hear the titles thereof fast∣ned
upon him: according to the Analogie of the Apostles
pre
ept, 
Let him that hath honour, be as if he had it not.

Thus, the longer your Lordship shall live, the less you will
delight in outward state, and daily discover the vanity there∣of;
especially in your old age, your soul will grow sensible, that
nothing can satisfie it, which is less then Grace, or Glory, or
God himself. To whose protection you are committed, by the
daily prayer of him, who is


Your Honours
most humble servant
THO. FULLER.

Here followeth the Map of Mount Libanus.


















THE
DESCRIPTION
OF
MOVNT LIBANVS
and the adjacent Countreys. The fourth Book.




CHAP. I.


§ 1. 
S
O much for the 
Iewel, Palestine
 it self. Now
for the 
Case
 thereof, namely the neighbour∣ing
Countreys which surrounded it. One∣ly
herein the 
Simile
 holds not, because 
Cases

serve, as to compass, so to preserve and de∣fend
the Jewell; whereas these bordering
nations were sworn enemies to oppose and
destroy the land and people of 
Palestine.
 The most quiet neighbour

Iudea
 had, was the 
Midland sea
 on the west side thereof, which though
sometimes (as the Psalmist observes) 
it would rage horribly,
 yet generally
it was more peaceable and serviceable then the Pagans, which bounded
them on all other quarters: as namely,



1 In 
Syria,
 on the north, 
Giblites, Arvadites, Aramites,
 &c.


2 In 
Arabia,
 on the east, and south-east 
Ammonites, Moabites, Ismaelites,
Midianites.


3 In 
Egypt,
 and the wilderness of the south, 
Edomites, Amalekites,
Egyptians,
 &c.




So that the 
Iews,
 to finde faithfull friends must not look about them,
but above them, even to heaven whence all their safety was derived.



§ 2. For the present we are to describe mount 
Libanus
 or 
Lebanon

with the parts of 
Syria
 confining thereunto. A mountain which some
will have so named from Frankincense, (
 in Greek) whereof
great plenty groweth there. Yet seeing it is usuall for Parents to give
names to their children, not children to their Parents, more probable
it is that Frankincense is called 
 from this mountain, breeding
store thereof, then that the mountain should be named 
Libanus
 from
Frankincense growing therein.


§ 3. But whilst humane writers are best pleased with this Greek
extraction of 
Libanus,
 more conformable to Scripture is the Hebrew
Etymology thereof from 
Whiteness:
 because the faithfull snow forsakes
not the top of this mountain (no not when persecuted by the Sun in the
dog-days) but remains there all the year long. A pleasant sight, at the
same time to have Winter on the top, and Sommer at the bottome of
one and the same mountain. Excellent the use of this snow in these hot
climats the Prophet
 mentioning it, as most welcome and precious,

Will a man leave the snow in Lebanon,
 wherewith the 
Tyrians
 and neighbour∣ing
nations used to allay and mixe their wines: so making the Torrid
and Frozen 
Zone
 to meet in the Temperate, more healthfull for their
Constitutions.


§ 4. 
Lebanon
 was a place so pleasant, that an Epicure therein might feed
all his senses to a surfeit.




1 
Sight.
 The 
pouse saith of
 Christ, 
His countenance is as Lebanon,

where most delightfull is the prospect, with high hills, humble
dales, sweet rivers, shady groves. No wonder then if 
Ptolemy

placeth 
Paradise
 a City hereabouts, where what Poets can fan∣cy,
Nature hath performed.


2 
Smell.
 Such the fragrancy of flowers, Gummes, and Spices
thereon, perfuming the aire round about.
 
His smell is as the smell of
Lebanon.


3 
Hearing.
 For besides the melody wrabled forth by the sweet
Choristers of the wood, pleasant it was to listen to the com∣plaints
which the Rivers murmuring made against the Rocks,
for wronging them in obstructing their channels: whose com∣plaints
therein, were so far from finding pity in mens hearts,
that they onely lulled their heads the sooner and faster as
eep.


4 
Taste, & Touch.
 Such the most delicious fruits and liquors this
mountain affords. 
Vinum C.O.S. The sent thereof shall be as the
 wine
of Lebanon. Galen
 also reporteth that yearly in mount 
Libanus

husbandmen used to sing, 
God raineth hony,
 at which time they
spread hides on the ground,
 and from the boughs of trees shook
into them the hony dropt from heaven (called there∣fore

mel roscidum & aereum
) filling pots and pitchers with the
same.





No wonder then that 
Moses
 made it his earnest request to take this
place in his way, to heaven: I
 
pray thee let me goe over and see the good land,
which is beyond Iordan, that goodly mountain and Lebanon.
 As if his soul more
conveniently might 
take his rise
 from the top thereof to eternall blisse,
and be the better provided to entertain endless happiness, when first he
had sipt some drops of the same in delightfull 
Lebanon,
 the temporall type
thereof.


§ 5. It will perchance be objected against the fertility of this place,
that the Prophet
 foretelleth, 
Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be
turned into a fruitfull field?
 Where its future conversion into fruitfulness
seemingly implies the present barrenness thereof. But here we must
distinguish betwixt 
field
 and 
forest
 fruitfulness. The former is compo∣sed
of the concurrence of art and industry with nature; the latter onely
takes what nature tenders, without any toile to improve the same,
wherein 
Libanus
 already did exceed. But now the Prophet foretells (be∣sides
this wild and native) an elaborate and artificiall fertility likely to
befall this mountain, namely in the speedy and universall alteration of
things in 
Israel,
 when champian fields for fear should be forsaken, and
husbandmen for their security retire with their tillage to mount 
Le∣banon.

Thus much for this fair and fruitfull place full of goodly trees,
wild and tame beasts in abundance; and yet when measured by an
infinite majesty,
 
Lebanon is not sufficient for him to burn, nor all the beasts there∣of
of sufficient for a burnt offering.


§ 6. Having largely praised this place (enough to set all the neigh∣bouring
Princes at variance about the propriety thereof) it is
now high time to inquire to whom the right thereof did belong. Here
we finde an undoubted evidence, that the same by a double title per∣teined
to the land and people of 
Israel.


1 As a fence to the vineyard. 2 As a Common to a City.
As a fence to a vineyard. So the Prophet in his Parable
 
And be
fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof.
 Now although this fen∣cing
principally refers to Gods protection over the 
Iews,
 yet is it not un∣appliable
to the naturall posture of their countrey, hem'd in with mount

Libanus
 on the north. Secondly, if we conceive all 
Iudea
 under the no∣tion
of a great city, 
Lebanon
 was a Common
 assigned thereunto, 
and ALL
LEBANON towards the Sunrising.
 And though probably the neighbouring
Tribes 
Asher, Naphtali,
 and 
Dan
 did reap the most benefit thereby, yet all
the rest are presumed to have a right both in the herbage for their pro∣fit,
and wild beasts for their pleasure. However, either with or without
the leave of 
Israel,
 the
 
Hivites
 (and
 
Archites,
 whose city 
Archa
 is by 
Ptole∣my

placed hereabouts) made bold to share with them in the
commodities of this mountain. Here grew the goodly Cedars, of whose
severall kindes, (some bearing fruit without flowers, others bringing
flowers without fruit) manner of growing, having streight and clean


bodies to the top, and there a tuft of boughs and leaves, (where should
the haire be but on the head?) naturall qualities or supernaturall rather,
(because said to be free from corruption, and therefore used to make

the statues of the Gods
) the Philosopher
 will give the best account, to
whose reports we remit the Reader.


§ 7. Forget we not that humane writers make a division of the
mountain, calling the northern ledge thereof 
Libanus,
 the southern 
Anti∣Libanus

whereas the Scriptures taking no notice of this distinction, ex∣press
both under the generall name of 
Libanus.


§ 8. And now to climbe this mountain, behold it every where scat∣tered
with 
Solomons
 workmen, some bearing of burdens, (Better to car∣ry
the meanest materiall to the Temple of God, then carve the most cu∣rious
pieces for the tower of 
Babel
) some hewing of stones, all busied,
either with their hands as labourers, or eyes as overseers. No hole left
for idleness to peep in at, but presently she was perceived and punished.
I hope without offence, one may wish them 
God speed,
 the rather be∣cause

 he 
that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees, was known to bring it to
an excellent work, but now they break down all the work thereof with axes and
hammers.


§ 9. It is now high time that leaving the generall description of 
Li∣banus

we come to survay the severall places on, or near thereunto. In the
southwest side thereof near 
Zidon,
 and the sea, lay the land of 
Cabul,

which 
Solomon
 gave to 
Hiram King of Tyre
 for the cost and charge he was
at in building the Temple. Hereby it appears that this territory (though
lying in
 
Galilee
 was no part of the 
Land of Canaan,
 it being above the
power of the Kings of 
Israel,
 to alienate any parcell thereof. But though
it was unlawfull 
to take the childrens bread, and cast it unto dogs,
 yet the crust
and parings thereof might be given them: to which this Land of 
Cabul

may well be compared, being so course and base a Countrey, that it little
contented King 
Hiram,
 who therefore called it
 
Cabul,
 that is 
dirty,
 or 
displea∣sing.

It may seem strange that 
Solomon,
 who in other things consulted
with his honour and magnificence and 
to whom God gave a large heart,

should herein have so narrow a hand, as not to give 
Hiram
 a friend and
forein Prince full consideration, who so freely had furnished him
with all necessaries for his building. But



1 Haply 
Solomon
 beheld 
Hiram
 as a Homager unto him, holding
the kingdome of 
Tyre
 from the Crown of 
Israel.
 And if so, then
all he did was but his duty, and fully rewarded in 
Solomons
 favou∣rable
acceptance thereof.


2 
Solomon
 might conceive 
Hirams
 expences sufficiently satisfied in
allowing his men such a vast
 proportion of yearly provision:
so these cities were given him not in compensation of the charge,
but as an overplus and meer gratuity. For which 
Hiram
 ought
to be thankfull because so good, not displeased because no better.



3 Most probable it is, that absolute need, and no other reason,
made 
Solomon
 fall short, in satisfying 
Hirams
 expectation. His
treasure being much exhausted (excess will begger wealth it self)
by his sumptuous structures. The same necessitous principles,
which caused his intolerable taxes on his own people, might
also make him (against his own will, and generous disposition)
faile in rewarding the full deserts of 
Hiram.




It is some contentment unto us, that though we know not the seve∣rall
names, yet the
 Scripture acquaints us with the exact number of the
cities in 
Cabul-land:
 being twenty in all, as in our Map, we have recko∣ned
them accordingly.


§ 10. But here some will be very much startled, that this land of

Cabul
 should so lately receive this denomination from 
Hirams
 displea∣sure,
whereas we finde it so called four hundred years before in the book
of 
Ioshua,
 where the borders of the Tribe of 
Asher,
 are thus assigned:
they 
goe out to
 Cabul on the left hand.
 To satisfie which seeming difficul∣ty,
we must know, that though the book of 
Ioshua
 contains matter of
far more ancient date,
 yet it was written by 
holy-men of God
 after the days
of 
David,
 and probably in the reign of 
Solomon.
 This appears because in

Ioshua
 mention is made of the book of 
Iasher,
 wherein the standing still
of the Sun and Moon was recorded, and that book of 
Iasher
 was pen∣ned
after 
Davids
 reign, because therein 
Davids
 acts were also Chro∣nicled.


§ 11. Mount 
Libanus
 is overspread with the
 
buildings of Solomon,

whereof some may be conceived the fragments made out of the Rem∣nants
and Reversions of the stone and timber left of what was provi∣ded
for the Temple. Yea probably some were platformes and modells
to heighten and improve the skill and knowledge of his builders. True
it is, in the making of the Tabernacle, every 
Tenon, board, hook
 and 
socket

were 
Iure Divino,
 both by precept and precedent, according to the
 
pat∣tern
in the Mount:
 but it was not so in the building of the Temple. There∣in,
God gave 
Solomon
 a 
large heart,
 and furnished him with 
Hiram
 a
skilfull workman: but as for all particular proportions, they were left
at large for their wisdomes to contrive. It may therefore with much
likelyhood be conceived, that to better their knowledge in Architecture
for the Temple some slight buildings in 
Libanon
 were erected, which
afterwards might serve 
Solomon
 for privacy, and pleasure, retirement, and
recreation. And seeing 
Solomon
 took his naturall history 
from the Cedar
that growes in Lebanon, to the Moss on the wall,
 haply he might study in some
of these buildings, where 
Cedars,
 and other simples were presented unto
him, being best able to comment on Natures works when he saw the
text before his eyes. Of these buildings in 
Libanus
 that tower 
which

looks towards Damascus
 was the principal, to which the Nose of the Spouse
in the 
Canticles
 is compared, for the whiteness, uniformity, and pro∣portionable


largeness thereof, whereby the generousness and animosity
of the Church is intimated. The
 
Philosopher
 telleth us that a tower-fashi∣oned
Nose (round and blunt at the top) is a signe of magnanimity.


§ 12. From this tower we may take the Prospect of all the adjacent
countrey: wherein we take no notice of the division of 
Syria
 according to
humane writers, but confine our selves to Scripture expressions.

Dan
 cannot be conceived [formally] to name cities, being as yet in the
body of his great Grandfather) but the eastermost fountain of 
Iordan,

anciently called 
Dan.
 And surely springs the issue of nature, are seni∣ours
to all cities the result of Art. Here 
Abraham
 overtook them, and with
three hnndred and odde men conqueredand pursued them (being nu∣merous
and flushed with former victorys) to
 
Hobah which is on the left side
of Damascus.
 Thus that army which is but a handfull of men, managed by
Gods hand, will work wonders. Hereby 
Lot
 recovered his liberty,
the 
King of Sodome
 his subjects, they their goods; the Auxiliaries of


Aner,
 
Eshcol
 and 
Mamre,
 received their pay out of the spoile, 
Melchisedec

had the tithes, 
Abraham
 the honour, and God the glory of the victory.


§ 13. 
Aram-Maachah,
 lay southeast of 
Aram-beth-Rehoh,
 the
 King
thereof appeared very active (though bringing into the field but a
thousand
 men) in the battell against King 
David.
 It seems 
Ioab
 the
politick Generall reputed these 
Syrians
 valiant, who took the
 choicest
men of 
Israel
 under his own conduct to oppose them, consigning the
refuse under 
Abishai
 against the
 
Ammnoites,
 presuming they would fly
of 
course,
 if the other were worsted: as indeed it came to pass. Appen∣dants
to this 
Aram-Maachah
 were



1 
Geshur:
 hereof 
Talmai
 the King; and 
Maachah
 his daughter was
maried to 
David,
 and mother to 
Absalom.
 No wonder then if the
child proved a cross to his Father, begotten on a heathen woman
contrary to Gods command. And here 
Absalom
 (changing his
climate, not conditions) staid
 three years, clouded with his
Fathers displeasure for murdering his brother 
Amnon.


2 
Ishtoh,
 which contributed twelve
 thousand men in the generall
engagement of the 
Syrians
 against King 
David.


3 
The land of Tob:
 that is, the 
good-land
 (or
 
Goth-land
 if you please)


so called from the goodness thereof. Though all the good we
know of it is this, that it afforded a safe refuge to
 
Iephthah,
 when
persecuted by his brethren, who hence was solemnely fetched
to be Judge of 
Israel.




Adrichomius,
 and other Authours here make the Land of
 
Uz
 where

Iob
 dwelt. I cannot blame any place to be desirous of so pious a man to
be an inhabitant therein. But both 
Iobs
 friends and foes forbid the situ∣ation
of 
the land of Uz
 here abouts. His foes the 
Sabeans,
 his friends 
Eli∣phaz

the 
Temanite
 &c. who are known to live far south of this place, of
whom properly in the description of 
Edom.


14. 
Aram
 of 
Damascus
 succeeds lying northeast of 
Aram-Maachah,

watered with the rivers of 
Abanah
 and 
Pharphar.
 This 
Abanah
 in humane
writers is called 
Chrysoroas
 or 
golden-streame
 from the yellowness of his
banks and water. Otherwise, as little gold is to be found in his chanell,
as at the 
golden grove
 in 
Caermarthen-shire,
 or at the 
golden-vale
 in 
Hereford∣shire.

However 
Abanah
 and 
Pharphar
 were highly beholden to
 
Naaman,

who preferred them 
before all the waters of Israel;
 as possibly they might
equall, yea exceed them in some outward respects. But what if the
water in the Cistern chance to be clearer then that in the Font? Know it
is divine institution, which puts the difference betwixt them, leaving
the one a plain Element, and making the other a soveraigne Sa∣crament.
This river 
Chrysoroas
 running northward is afterwards swal∣lowed
up in the sandy ground, and there is the visible end thereof. So
that 
Solomons
 rule, 
All rivers run into the
 Sea,
 must admit of an exception
or exposition, namely either openly or secretly, as no doubt this river
hath an underground recourse to the Ocean.


§ 15. Coming near to 
Damascus
 we finde the place where Saint

Paul
 was cast down to the ground, as he went with a Commission
from the high Priest to persecute the Saints of 
Damascus.
 Now seeing

Damascus
 was not in 
Iudea,
 if any demand why 
Paul
 should straggle so
far from his own Countrey, hear his own answer, 
Being exceedingly
 mad
against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities:
 and it is reason enough
for the actions of blind zeale, that they are the actions of blind zeale.
Besides, it seems the high Priests at 
Ierusalem
 had a kind of Ecclesiasticall
jurisdiction over the 
Iews
 in all places. Some seeming contradiction,
but on serious thoughts easily reconciled, appears in the history of Saint

Pauls
 travells.

Acts 9.7.
 
The men also which journeyed with
him stood amazed, hearing a voice, but
seeing no man.
Acts 22.9.
 
Moreover they that were with me saw indeed a
light, and were afraid, but heard not the voice of him
that spak
 unto me.


For, two things considerable in this vi
ion.




1 The generals thereof communicated to his fellow-travellers, that
they might attest the truth of this miraculous accident. No seem∣ing
fancy but really acted. Hereupon they heard confusedly that


there was a sound, but heard not distinctly what that sound was,
and were admitted to see a light, but did not discover the person
of 
Iesus
 appearing.


2 The particulars thereof imparted to 
Paul
 alone (as calculated
onely for his conversion) whose eares and eyes plainly heard
and saw the voice and apparition.




Hence Saint 
Paul
 was conducted to the city of 
Damascus,
 whither we
follow after him.


§ 16. 
Damascus
 is by some conceived to have been founded by 
Eliezer
Abrahams Steward,
 onely because he is styled
 
Eliezer of Damascus:
 But if
so, then signall was the piety of 
Eliezer
 who preferred rather to live a
servant in 
Abrahams
 good family, then to rule as a Lord in a great city of
his own building. Various was the success and fortune of 
Damascus
 un∣der
severall Lords, and we will onely instance in such as are mentioned
in Scripture.




1 It was inhabited by the 
Syrians,
 and accounted the Metropolis
of the Countrey.


2 It was probably conquered by 
David,
 when he put
 garisons
into 
Aram of Damascus.


3 In the days of 
Solomon
 it was possessed by 
Rezin
 a fugitive 
Syrian,

who being made a King thereof,
 was a professed enemy to 
Israel.


4 It was won by 
Ieroboam
 the second, King of 
Israel,
 who is said to
have restored
 
Damascus.


5 It was recovered again by the 
Syrians,
 and 
Rezin
 in the days of

Ahaz
 was
 King thereof.


6 It was taken by 
Tiglath-Peleser
 King of 
Assyria,
 who carried all
the inhabitants thereof away captive.




In the new Testament we finde it in subjection to the 
Roman Empe∣rour,

under whom
 
Aretas
 was King, a persecuter of Saint 
Paul.


§ 17. Wonder not that the 
Roman Emperours
 ruling over the world,
should suffer some Kings to reign under them: which was their con∣stant
practise, and whereby they received no small benefit. For first,
hereby they kept their people in more willing obedience, when they
saw their former government not wholly altered, but some shadow
thereof still remaining in their Kings continued amongst them. Se∣condly,
when any distastfull project was set on foot, the Emperours used
these Kings to promote it: so casting the odium upon them, which
themselves declined, while such
 Kings (usually by their immediate de∣pendence)
durst not displease, but doe whatsoever the Emperours en∣joined
them. Thirdly, it conduced to the state of their Empire to have
Kings homagers thereunto. It is but a 
Farme
 (though of never so great
revenues) and not reputed a 
Manor,
 which hath not some free-holders
holding of it, and owing 
suit and service
 unto it. Semblably it was part
of the Imperiall glory amongst the 
Romans
 to have even Kings to hold


their Scepters and Crowns, by deputation under it, as 
Herod
 in 
Iudea,
Deiotarus
 in 
Galatia,
 our 
Lucius
 in 
Britain,
 and this 
Aretas
 King of 
Da∣mascus.


§ 18. Under him Saint 
Paul
 had a miraculous deliverance, though
both Prince and people plotted his destruction, and
 
watched the gates
day and night that they might kill him.
 But what saith the Psalmist? 
Except

the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain,
 either to keep out those
whom he will have in, or to keep in those whom he will have out. All
the wall shall be one open gate to those, whom divine providence will
have to escape, as here to Saint 
Paul,
 being let down over the wall by a
rope in a basket.


§ 19. Amongst the publick buildings of 
Damascus,
 the house of

Rimmon
 was most remarkable; It troubled the tender Conscience of
converted 
Naaman,
 when his Master went up to worship there,
 that he had so
often bowed to that Idoll: so an excellent
 Critick proves the words to
be read, relating not to his future but former actions. Wherefore the
Prophets answer, 
Goe in peace,
 is not a toleration of his Idolatry for the
time to come, but an absolution from his former faults, upon 
Naamans

free confession and serious sorrow for the same. They shew also
in this city the house or rather hole wherein
 
Ananias
 (Saint 
Pauls
 ghost∣ly-
father) dwelt or lurked, being a Cellar under ground, to which pil∣grimes
descend by many staires, who have so filled the walls thereof by

 writing their names therein, that Reader there is no room left to re∣gister
thy name if going thither.


§ 20. Modern 
Damascus
 is a beautifull city. The first, 
Damask-rose

had its root here, and name hence. So all 
Damask
 silk, Linen, poul∣der
and plumbes called 
Damascens.
 Two things at this day are most re∣markeable
amongst the inhabitants: There are no Lawyers amongst
them, no Advocates or Sollicitors of causes, no compacts being made
for future performance, but 
Weigh
 and 
Pay,
 all bargains being driven
with ready money. Secondly, Physicians here are paid no fee, except
the patient recover his health. And now I perceive that 
Mahomet
 was a
politick man, who entered but once into 
Damascus,
 and perceiving the
pleasures thereof, would never return again, for fear (forsooth) lest he
should be bewitched with the delightfulness thereof, and hindred from
the great work he had in hand. I indeed perceive that so pleasant a sub∣ject
hath too long retarded my pen, almost forgetfull to goe forward
in our description, we therefore leave it and proceed.


§ 21. 
Aram-Zobah
 lay north-east of 
Aram-Damascus. Hadadezar
 or

Hadarezar
 was King thereof, so glorious a Prince, that his servants wore
shields of gold in war, as if they intended to dazle their enemies eyes
with the splendor of their armes; but all in vain. For the best swords
of steel will command the bravest shield of gold: and 
David
 at 
Elam,

got an absolute conquest of him, killing
 
Shobach
 his Captain, as for∣merly


he had
 defeated him and stript him of much rich spoile. As for
those golden shields, they fell not to the shares of any private persons,
but were treasured up by 
David
 for the building of the Temple, where
this glorious Plate shined in its proper sphear; and where Riot, and
Luxury abused by man, was converted into well grounded bounty,
as bestowed on Gods service. Here 
David
 houghed the horses of 
Hada∣dezar,

and onely reserved an hundred
 chariots of them as a Trophee
of triumph to be used for state at publick solemnities.


§ 22. Some will censure this as an improvident and unpolitick act,
and character 
David
 as more happy to get, then able to use a victory;
not casually letting slip, but wilfully casting 
such a power of horse
 out of
his hand, which managed with a proportionable infantry, might have
given Law to all the east Countrey. Surely it was not done out of a
cowardly suspicion, lest the 
Syrians
 should recover those horses again;
much less out of consciousness of want of horsemanship in the 

to set riders upon them: Rather it was, that 
David
 being privy to the
deceitfulness of mans heart (how hard it was to have much humane
strength, and not to have confidence in it) did it to wean his subjects
from 
the arme of flesh,
 that they might more rely on divine protection.
And he did it, to encourage in them, what properly is called 
Manhood:

that they might not expect victories of equivocall generation begotten
betwixt men and horses, but such atchieved onely by mans prowess,
instrumentall to get, and Gods providence, the principall to give them.
Yea 
David
 might seem to have houghed all the horses in the world, with
that his short, but sharp sentence, 
A
 horse is but a vaine thing to save a
man.


§ 23. It will further be objected, that grant these horses not to be
used in the wars of 
Israel,
 yet what needs this wast to spoile Gods good
creatures? Might they not have been sold for many talents and given to
the poor? It is answered, that 
David
 did it in an holy 
Brave,
 to shew
that the Pagans pride, was 
Israels
 scorn, and that he as much disdained to
gain wealth by the sale, as to get strength by the service of those horses.
Besides, 
David
 herein did follow the precept given to, and pressed and
practised by
 
Ioshua
 in the like case. And indeed multiplying of horses
was
 forbidden the Kings of 
Israel.
 But after 
Davids
 days the Militia
was much altered and managed by horse; by the way, 
Absalom
 was the
first 
Israelite,
 whom we finde riding in a chariot, and how he was blest
is not unknown: Afterwards 
Solomon
 brought many horses out of

Egypt,
 and an Egyptian wife on the back of them, who certainly hin∣dred
more, then the other helped him; and generally the 
Israelites
 were
more prosperous before their use of horses, then ever after; Their suc∣cess
was mounted when they fought on foot, but scarce went on foot
when their armies were mounted on horseback.


§ 24. But to return to 
Aram-Zobath:
 Two prime cities thereof with


four names are mentioned in Scripture,
 
Beta,
 and 
Berothat,
 elsewhere
called 
Tibhah
 and 
Chun.
 Here (not to say that 
Beta
 and 
Tibhah
 by Meta∣thesis
are the same) it is no newes for cities standing in the confines of
severall kingdomes, and the juncture of severall languages to have dou∣ble
names. What the English-man calls 
Glocester
 and 
Worcester,
 the
Welsh-men tearm
 
Caer Loyw
 and 
Caer-Frangon.
 And probably one of
the names of these cities was 
Hebrew
 and the other 
Aramite.
 Both of
them afforded much brass
 to King 
David
 (Gods receiver generall for
that purpose) for the building of the Temple. But 
Zobah
 which gave
the name to this Countrey is generally conceived at this day to be called

Aleppo,
 (though some 
Iews
 inhabiting therein count it anciently the
city of 
Sepharvaim
) from 
Alep
 which signifies
 
milke
 in the Turkish
language; whereof such plenty here, that if 
via lactea
 be to be found
on earth, it is in this place. It is so seated on a navigable stream which
runs into 
Euphrates,
 that here the commodities of the East and West doe
meet. The former from 
Babylon
 by water, the latter by 
Land-caravans

from 
Scanderoon,
 and this city is the golden clasp to couple both sides of
the world together, and we remit the Reader to modern Merchants for
further information thereof.


§ 25. And here standing on the utmost verge of our map we could
wish it of such extent as might represent to the Reader 
Aram-Naharam

or 
Mesopotamia
 (otherwise 
Padan-Aram
) where 
Bethuel
 and 
Laban
 dwelt;

Charran,
 whither 
Abraham
 first removed; 
Caldea
 and 
Ur,
 a city where he
formerly dwelt; 
Babylon
 and 
Nineveh,
 the two Emperesses of the world,
with the rivers which watered and bounded Paradise it self. But alass,
as Prodigalls who have spent their possessions take little delight to see
a survey of the lands they have sold, (the sad remembrancer of their for∣mer
riot and present wretchedness) so small comfort can accrew un∣to
us by the curious enquiry into the ancient place of Paradise, having
long since in our first Parents forfeited all our right and title thereunto.
But the main matter forbidding our Pens progress any further, is be∣cause,
as 
Shimei
 confined by 
Solomon
 to 
Ierusalem
 suffered justly as an offen∣der
for gadding to
 
Gath:
 so 
Palestine
 with the neighbouring countreys
being the proper subject of our discourse, we shall be taken trespassers,
if found wandering beyond the bounds thereof. However I hope
without offence my hand may point further then my feet may follow,
and tell the Reader that the fore-named places lie northeast of the city
of 
Aleppo.


§ 26. The land of 
Hamah
 lay west of 
Aram-Zobah,
 anciently inha∣bited
by the 
Hamathites,
 descended from the eleventh and youngest Son
of 
Canaan
 the Son of 
Cham,
 of whom largely before. In the days of 
David
Toi
 was King of this Countrey, who being at war with 
Hadadezar,
 and
hearing how the 
Israelites
 had defeated him, sent
 
Ioram
 his Son to King

David
 with presents in his hand and complements in his mouth,


to congratulate his victory. Long after 
Salmaneser
 subdued this coun∣trey
and extinguished the royall race; witness that brag: 
Where is the
King of Hamath
 and of Arpad?
 Though that proud question admits of
an answer; namely, 
they were even there, where their sins set them:
 seeing it was
not so much the 
Assyrian
 valour, as the 
Syrian
 wickedness which cast these
Kings out of their countrey. 
Riblah
 was a prime city in this land,
where 
Nebuchadnezzar
 caused the eyes of
 
Zedekiah
 to be bored out.
Some conceive this done in the land of 
Nephtali,
 others with more like∣lihood
in this place, and we (see Reader our carefulness to please all
if possible in this captious age) mention it in both. Yet because this

Riblah
 was many miles nearer to 
Babylon,
 and further from 
Ierusalem,
 it
is more probable to be the place, as more for 
Nebuchadnezzars
 ease and

Zedekiahs
 anguish: it adding to the conquerours state to fetch the cap∣tive
furthest from his own countrey.


§ 27. 
Hamah
 the city which gave the name to this countrey, was af∣terwards
called 
Antiochia.
 Seven and twenty cities are said to be of the
same name. For severall 
Antiochuses
 being successively Kings of 
Syria,

stocked their dominions with many cities after their names, as being
either built, beautified, strengthened or enlarged by them, or their Fa∣vorites.
But it matters not how many younger brethren there be of the
same family, as long as our 
Antioch
 is the heire, and though not in age, in
honour to be preferred before all the rest. Here the professor of the Go∣spell
formerly termed 
Beleevers
 for their faith, sometimes 
Brethren
 for
their love, 
Saints
 for their 
holinesse, Disciples
 for their knowledg, were for
all these first called
 
Christians.
 Probably when many of all nations be∣leeved,
the name 
Christian
 was given them, to bury the difference be∣twixt

Iews
 and 
Gentiles
 (thus 
England
 and 
Scotland
 happily joined in 
great
Britain
) which two names though remaining afterwards, were used
as terms of civill difference, not odious distinction. Had this happened
at 
Rome,
 how would the Tide of 
Tiber
 have swoln above all his bounds
and banks at the conceit that in her city Religion it self was christened?
But this 
Antioch
 hath still more to brag of: The 
Chair of Saint Peter,
 where∣in
he sate Patriarch many years before his removeall to 
Rome:
 and there∣fore
no wonder if 
Antioch
 grudge to give 
Rome
 the superiority. Why
should not that place be the prime, which was the first? Besides, Saint

Peter
 was honoured at 
Antioch,
 murdered at 
Rome.
 And why should
that City receive most credit by him, which used most cruelty unto him?
But let Ecclesiasticall Heralds deduce the pedegree, and martiall the pre∣cedency
of these Churches, we will onely adde, that this Pharisaicall

taking of the upper-hand,
 hath in all ages hindered the 
giving of the right hand
of Christian fellowship.


§ 28. Now surely no malignant quality in this place, but a principle
of perversness in mens hearts was the cause, that so many famous con∣tentions
happened in this city of 
Antioch.
 Here it was, that some 
com∣ming


down from Iudea,
 maintained the necessity of
 circumcision, and the
legall ceremonies, endevouring to set up a religion (like those monsters
in 
Africa,
 begotten betwixt severall kindes, partaking of both, perfect in
neither, but defective in their very redundancy) a 
edley mongrel betwixt
Judaisme and Christianity. This occasioned the calling of the first
great Councell in 
Ierusalem,
 which in fine concluded that this legall Yoke
was not to be laid on the neck of Christians. Here 
Peter
 being guilty
(it is the expression of
 
Erasmus
) of 
superstitious dissimulation,
 with his ex∣ample
(oh the impulsive power of great mens Precedents!) brought

 
Barnabas
 into the same fault: for which Saint 
Paul
 presently and pub∣lickly
reproved him. But we will not widen the wounds in good
mens memories, rather commending to posterity, the holy zeale of
Saint 
Paul
 in seasonable giving, the humble piety of Saint 
Peter
 in pati∣ent
taking so sharp a reproof.


§ 29. But the greatest contention happening here, was that 
Paroxysme

betwixt 
Paul
 and 
Barnabas,
 the one as earnestly refusing, as the other
desiring the company of 
Iohn Mark
 to goe along with them. In which
contest, 
Paul
 is generally conceived to have most reason, 
Ba
nabas
 most
passion on his side, because



1 He saw clearly without carnall relation, whilest 
Barnabas
 beheld

Mark
 his
 sisters son through the spectacles of naturall affection.


2 A reason is rendred by 
Paul
 why 
Markes
 company should be
declined, namely, because he
 departed from them at 
Pamphilia

and deserted the work, none alledged by 
Barnabas
 why the same
should be accepted.


3 
Paul
 immediately departing after this contention is said to
 
be re∣commended
by the brethren to the grace of God,
 which seems to amount
to a generall approbation of his carriage herein. No such pas∣sage
appears of 
Barnabas.


4 After this time Saint 
Paul
 and his acts are celebrated in every
Chapter, whereas 
Barnabas
 sinks here in silence, and his name
mentioned no more in the history of the Scripture.




But we must admire Gods wisdome in mans weakness, sanctifying
this discord to his glory. For whilest 
Paul
 and 
Barnabas
 were newly
converted, and their company needfull for mutuall assistance each to o∣ther,
their persons and affections were united together: but now
grown strong in grace, and able singly to subsist, God suffered this un∣happy
difference to sever them. Whereby the 
Gospell
 encreased, the one
sailing to 
Cyprus,
 the other staying in 
Syria.
 So whereas formerly one
place at the same time did jointly enjoy them; now there became two
Flockes, two shepheards, two vines, two vinedressers, and the division
of Preachers proved the multiplication of preaching.


§ 30. We must not forget how one 
Nicolas
 a Proselyte of this city of

 
Antioch,
 was the last of the seven Deacons, and the first founder of an


heresie (which God professeth himself to
 hate) from him called the

Nicolaitans.
 For this
 
Nicolas
 is reported to have had a beautifull woman
to his wife, and being taxed for being causlesly jealous of her, to vindi∣cate
his innocence, he prostituted her to the embraces of any that would
lie with her; with some other strange opinions he maintained. Those
therefore who so undiscreetly express their detestation of one sin, that
they fall foul on the committing of the contrary, may by a spirituall
proportion be accounted mysticall 
Nicolaitans.


§ 31. There was also belonging to 
Antioch
 (pardon a little digressi∣on)
a delicious suburb called 
Daphne,
 where 
Apollo Daphneus
 was adored.
Now (some three hundred sixty years after Christ) 
Iulian
 the Apostate, the
professed enemy to piety, sacrificed hereto this 
Devill-God,
 who used to be
very talkative in giving of Oracles, but lately was grown very mute. And
being demanded the reason of his suddain silence answered (forsooth)
it was because the body of 
Babylas
 (martyred under 
Decius
 the Empe∣rour)
was buried near his Temple, the vertue whereof stopped his
wind-pipe. Hereupon a conceit was taken that other Martyrs bones
might be found upon triall as terrible to the devill, which gave the

first occasion to the enshrining, worshipping, and circumgestation of
the Reliques of Saints. See how 
Satan
 (much delighted in his apish
Parallels of divine service) was ambitious, that a dominative point
of Antichristianisme should have its originall in the same place where
the name of Christianity first began. But long since 
Antioch
 hath smarted
for this superstition and her other sins; reduced at this day to a petty
village, (standing in the rode betwixt 
Scanderoon
 and 
Aleppo
) and 
Orontes

the river thereof once navigable, (Saint 
Paul
 is said to have
 sailed to

Antioch
) much obstructed with sand, and more profitable for good 
Eeles

there taken, then any other commodity, and the few buildings remain∣ing
miserably ruinous. But seeing silkes, though ragged, may be worn
with the less discredit; the torn and tattered edifices in 
Antioch
 seem no
disgrace, because most of them are made of rich stuffe, even costly mar∣ble
curiously polished.


§ 32. Leaving 
Antioch
 we come to 
Seleucia
 seated on the sea side, a
Port once graced with Saint
 
Pauls
 presence: whence they sailed into

Cyprus
 lying over against it. This Island is so called from 
Cypress
 trees
growing there in abundance, which a great
 Critick conceives to be
that 
Gopher
 wood,
 whereof the Arke of 
Noah
 was made, and boldly af∣firmes
that setting aside the adventitious termination, 
CUPAR
 and

GOPHER
 are effectually the same in Hebrew. Frequent the use of
Cypress-boughs in Funeralls, whereof the
 reason is rendred, because
that tree cut down sprouts no more, as no naturall hope of a dead corps
reviving.
 Coffins also were generally made of Cypress even amongst
the heathen, in memoriall, as
 one will have it, of the deluge, and man∣kinde
buried quick many moneths in the Cypress ark. The distance


of 
Cyprus
 from the continent cannot be great, if it be true what
 
Pliny
 reports,
that whole heards of Deer used to swim over thither (senting, though
not seeing land) the formost like an adventurous Captain valiantly con∣ducting
them; and then in order one so lying on another, that the
leaders hanch was the followers pillow to rest his head upon. Most fruit∣full
was this Island, affording all things both for pleasure and luxury, and
therefore 
Venus
 worshipped for chief Deity therein. The women of this
countrey anciently were very wanton, or as they counted it, very religious,
for having a whore for their Goddess, no wonder if adultery was their

§ 33. Amongst the eminent persons bred in 
Cyprus,
 whilest States∣men
take speciall notice of 
Solon
 the lawgiver, Philosophers of 
Zeno
 the
Stoick, Poets of 
As
tepiades
 first authour of those verses from him so
called, it will be fittest for us to observe
 
Mnason
 an old Disciple; hoste
to Saint 
Paul, Sergius
 Paulus
 deputy of this Island, a prudent man, Saint

Pauls
 Convert; and 
Barnabas
 here born a 
Iew-Levit-Cypriot
 (the first by
nation, the next by family, the last by place of his nativity) and had
therein possessions of considerable value. If any say it was covetous∣ness,
and distrust of divine providence in 
Barnabas
 to be a 
landed
 
Levite,

because that Tribe had no inheritance given them; 
The Lord of Israel was
their
 inheritance:
 Let such know, that constitution was onely tempora∣ry
and locall, to last no longer, then whilest the 
Iews
 continued at home
in a settled Commonwealth, after whose banishment abroad, happy
that 
Le
ite,
 who (when charity of others waxed cold) could warm
himself with his own well gotten goods. But afterwards 
Barnabas
 that

Son of consolation
 (comforting the bowels of the Saints as well by his
works as words, deeds as doctrine) sold
 his possessions; and tendered
the price thereof at the feet of the Apostles. Such practises were sincere∣ly
performed in the primitivetimes, superstitiously imitated with opi∣nion
of merit in after ages, and scornfully derided by too many in our
days, so far from parting with the propriety, that they will not appro∣priate
a part of their goods to good uses. We finde Saint 
Paul,
 preaching
in two cities in 
Cyprus;
 Salamis,
 where there was a Synagogue of the

Iews,
 and 
Paphos
 (where 
Venus
 was worshipped, thence surnamed 
Paphia,

and) where 
Elymas,
 the sorcerer was struck blind, for opposing Saint

Paul.
 We cannot recover 
Paphos
 proportionably into this Map, behold
it therefore peeping in, but excommuned the lines thereof.


§ 34. But to return to the Continent, where we fall on 
Syrophoenicia,

whose mixt name speakes its middle situation betwixt 
Syria
 and 
Phenice,

so that if those two countrys should fall out, no fitter umpire to arbitrate
their difference then 
Syrophoeni
ia,
 participating of, and therefore presu∣med
impartiall to both. Of this
 Countrey was that 
bold begger,
 who
would have no 
saying nay,
 but importunate in the behalf of her daughter,
no whit discouraged with the disadvantage of her person, disaffection


of the disciples, (miserable mediatours interceding for her repulse) deep
silence and afterwards disdainful denial of Christ himself, would not de∣sist
(as if her zeal was heated with the Antiperistasis of the cold comfort
she received) till the violence of her faith had wrested a grant from our
Saviour. The bounds of 
Syrophoenicia
 are variously assigned, the princi∣pall
cities whereof are 
Laodicea,
 different from that, to which Saint 
Iohn

wrote, and whose
 lukewarm temper made health it self sick thereof.


§ 35. Next we finde on the sea the city of 
Gebal
 (in 
Ptolemy
 and 
Strabo
Gabala
) and the Inhabitants therein and thereabouts, termed 
Giblites
 in

 Scripture. These led the 
Van
 in the grand conspiracy against 
Israel,

 Gebal
 and 
Ammon
 and 
Amalek, the Philistims with the inhabitants of Tyre,
Asher also &c.
 But 
Solomon
 taught their hands another lesson, not
to fight against Gods people, but to help to finish his
 Temple. At
the Coronation of 
Tyre
 the Queen-Mart of the world, (so largely de∣scribed
by 
Ezekiel,
 where all neighbouring Cities as in 
Grand-Sergeantry,

held their places, by some speciall attendance about her) the 
Ancients of
Gebal, and the wisemen thereof were her
 calkers,
 to stop the leakes and chinks in
her ships, so cunning were the 
Giblites
 in that imployment. Yet all their
curiosity in this kind, could not keep out the deluge of divine anger,
from entring their own City, which at this day hath drowned 
Gebal
 in
utter destruction.


§ 36. More south the river 
Eleutherus
 arising out of 
Libanus,
 shaped
his course to the sea, so being the northern boundary of 
Phoenicia.
 In this
river, saith reverend
 
Beza,
 was the 
Eunuch
 baptized by 
Philip,
 therein
making an unexcusable mistake. For except the Eunuch in his travell
went (like the Sun on
 
Abaz
 his dial) backwards, it was impossible
for him going to 
Gaza,
 and so into 
Aethiopia
 his own countrey, once to
come near this river, lying far north quite the contrary way. Had 
Beza

(in stead of the Eunuch baptized) placed the Emperour 
Barbarossa

drowned here, it had born better proportion to truth. However from
this learned mans mistake, I collect comfortable confidence of pardon
for my faults committed in this our description. For seeing so strong
legs are prone to stumble, surely the falls of my feeble feet will be freely
forgiven me by the charitable Reader.


§ 37. Near the running of 
Eleutherus
 into the midland sea stood 
An∣taradus,

so called because opposite to 
Aradus (Arvad
 in Scripture) a city
of remarkable antiquity, situation, and subsistence. Well doth 
Strabo

call this an ancient place, seeing it retained its name, more then two
thousand years, from
 
Arvad
 the ninth son of 
Canaan,
 even till after the
time of our Saviour. The city is seated in an Island seven furlongs in
compass, and twenty distant from the Continent, being all a main
 rock
(industry and ingenuity will make wealth grow on a bare stone) wa∣tered
in peace from the main land, in war with an engine (consult with
our
 Author for the forme thereof) which limbeck-like extracted


sweet water out of the brackish Ocean. The citizens of this place
served 
Tyre
 in a double office; by land as souldiers, 
The men of
 Arvad
with thine army were upon the walls round about;
 by water, as failers▪ 
The in∣habitants
of Arvad were thy mariners:
 which sufficiently speaks their dexteri∣ty
in either Element.


§ 38. Next the men of 
Arvad
 the Prophet mentioneth the
 
Gamma∣dims

(the joint naming them probably insinuates the vicinity of their
habitation) which were 
in the Tower of Tyre
 as a garison to defend them.
By 
Gammadims
 some understand 
Pygmies
 of a Cubit-high (equall to the
standard of 
Ehuds
 dagger) because, 
Gamad
 signifies a 
cubit
 in the He∣brew
tongue. But how ill doth this measure agree with martiall men?
except any will say, that as the 
Iebusites,
 in a proud confidence of the na∣turall
strength of mount 
Sion,
 placed the
 
lame and blind
 to man the same:
so the 
Tyrians
 presumed that dwarfes were tall enough to make good
their giant fortifications. More likely is the conjecture of
 
Tremellius,

that the 
Gammadims
 were a people in 
Phoenicia
 inhabiting a part thereof,
which ran out bowed and bended into the sea. And we know that

Ancona
 in 
Italy,
 and
 
Elbow-lane
 in 
London
 receive names from the same
fashion. And seeing 
Cornish-men
 are so called from the forme of their
Countrey, dwelling in a land which by degrees is contracted or nar∣rowed
into the likeness of an horn; why not 
Gammadims Cubit-men

from the similitude of their countrey in the situation thereof? Here to
fortifie his conjecture 
Tremellius
 produceth a place in
 
Pliny
 of 
Gamala
 a
city in 
Phoenicia,
 since swallowed up, where he conceiveth the 
L.
 to be
changed into the 
D.
 that the 
Gammadims
 were inhabitants thereof. How∣ever
for quietness sake, may the Reader be contented, to suffer them to
remain there in our Map, if not as dwellers, onely as sojourners, untill
such time as learned men shall provide a more proper place for them.


§ 39. And now on a suddain we are fallen unawares against our pro∣pounded
order, on 
Phoenicia,
 of the name and nature of which countrey
formerly in the Tribe of 
Asher.
 The chief havens therein were 
Tripolis;

so called, say
 some, because it hath been thrice build; by others, because

 three Cities (
Tyre, Sidon,
 and 
Aradus
) concurred to the building thereof.
Next is the promontory called 
 or 
Gods face,
 which no whit
afrighted the Pirates, and sea-robbers (who had a Castle hard by, called


Castellum praedonum
) from their mischievous cruelty. 
Botrus
 succeeds,
whose name signifieth a 
bunch of grapes,
 either from plenty of wine grow∣ing
there, or because the houses in this compacted city were built in a
cluster, though now become so thin scarce any two of them stand toge∣ther.

Byblus
 the birth-place of 
Philo
 commonly surnamed 
Byblius, Barutis,

anciently a good haven, now decayed. 
Adonius,
 so called from the mini∣on
of 
Venus
 worshipped hereabouts, and 
Licus
 are the chief rivers in this
countrey: (having many other smaller brooks) and 
Climax
 the moun∣tain
of most note, whose figure like that 
figure in Rhetorick
 ascends like
a staire-case by degrees.



§40. 
Coelosyria
 is onely behind, or 
hollow Syria,
 so called because lying
in a concavity betwixt the mountains of 
Libanus
 and 
Antilibanus.
 Though

Ptolemy
 and others stretch the name thereof in a large acception, even
as far as 
Arabia.
 Full it was of fair cities, but none we meet with named
in Scripture, and therefore forbear the further prosecution thereof. One∣ly
to cover the nakedness of our map, we mention four modern villages
under the command of the 
Turkes,
 where, and where
 alone the 
Syriack

tongue is spoken at this day, namely, 
Hatcheeth, Sharri, Blouza,
 and 
Eden.

The last the seat of a Bishop of the 
Maronites
 (who have a poor Patriarch
residing at 
Tripoli
) and the people here against all sense conceive this

Eden
 to be the place of Paradise. Worse errours they maintain in point
of doctrine, concurring with the Greek Church; but in discipline late
reconciled to 
Rome,
 where the 
Pope
 on his own cost gives some of their
children education. Honest harmeless people these 
Maronites
 are, happy
in the ignorance of luxury, and so hospitable that in stead of receiving,
they return thanks to any western Christians which will accept of their
entertainment.


§ 41▪ There remains nothing more in the Map for me to acquaint
the Reader with, save onely that we have set the modern stages or
Innes (we must have all wares in our pack, not knowing what kind of
chapmen we shall light on) betwixt 
Aleppo
 and 
Damascus,
 and so for∣wards
to 
Ierusalem.
 Amongst these 
Canes
 or 
Turkish Innes, Marra
 and 
Cote∣fey

are most beautifull; the latter, little inferiour to the 
old Exchange in
London;
 built by a 
Bashaw
 (ô let not Christians confound, whilest Turkes
found places, for publick use) for the benefit of travellers, being both a
Castell for their protection, and a Colledge for their provision: Where
on the founders cost sufficient food is afforded both them and their cat∣tell.
As for some Christian travellers who
 scorned to feed there∣on,
it seems that either they were not soundly hungry, or were not of
the solid judgment of 
Eliah,
 who surely would have taken meate from
the hands of Turkes, who refused not flesh from the beakes of
 Ravens.


Here the Map of 
Midian, Moab, Ammon, Edom,
 is to be inserted.


















THE DESCRIPTION OF
MIDIAN, MOAB, AMMON,
EDOM. CHAP. 2.


§ 1. 
B
Efore we come to the particular description of
the Countreys, something for satisfaction; why

Midian
 first, and why 
Midian
 and 
Moab
 together.
In giving 
Midian
 the Precedency, we observe se∣niority,
he being extracted from 
Abraham
 the
uncle, by 
Keturah
 his wife, whilest 
Moab
 came
from 
Lot
 the nephew, by his own daughter. As for putting them toge∣ther,
we are loath to confess our poverty, that lack of larger instructions
to furnish forth severall Maps, was any cause of our conjoining them
together. The main motive is not onely the vicinity of their habitation,
but also correspondency of severall atchievements betwixt them, which
makes them often coupled together in Scripture. Thus
 
Hadad King
of Edom smote Midian in the field of Moab.
 The Elders of 
Moab
 and
 the El∣ders
of 
Midian
 were jointly imployed to fetch 
Balaam.
 The
 daughters
of 
Moab
 and the daughters of 
Midian
 enticed the 
Israelites
 to whoredome
and Idolatry.


§ 2. 
Midian
 consisted of two families: one seated southward near the

Red-sea,
 serving the true God, (not so purely but with the mixture of su∣perstitions)
where 
Iethro Moses
 his father-in
law lived, of whom (God
willing) hereafter. The other Idolaters, planted more eastward; the
subject of our present discourse. This distance of place and difference of
Religions gave probability to their opinions, who fancy them two
distinct nations, which is seemingly confirmed, because the former is
called 
Madian
 in the
 new Testament. But though in some cases we con∣fess
that the difference of a letter, may make more then a literall diffe∣rence,
yet here it is not enough to make a reall distinction: seeing He∣brew
words made Greek often suffer greatermutations then of a vowell,

Midian
 into 
Madian.
 Others are startled, because the 
Midianites
 are
 some∣times
termed 
Ishmaelites,
 whereas the latter come from 
Hagar,
 the former


from 
Keturah.
 But it is probable (surely such as reject our conjecture
will substitute a better in the room thereof) that because 
Ishmael
 was
the eldest son of 
Abraham,
 chief of the house, all those eastern people de∣scended
from 
Abraham
 were denominated by the genericall name of

Ishmaelites.


§ 3. It is as difficult precisely to define the bounds, as impossible
compleatly to describe the Countrey of 
Midian.
 For besides the mixture
and conjunction (not to say confusion) of these eastern people, interfe∣ring
amongst themselves in their habitations, the 
Midianites
 especially led
erraticall lives, and therefore had uncertain limits. They dwelt most in
tents, which we may call 
moving towns,
 and 
extempore cities,
 set up in a
few houres, and in fewer taken down and dissolved. Next morning
oft times found them many miles off, from the place where last night
left them. And if we wonder at the wildness of their wandring, and
rudeness of their roving abroad, they will admire as much at the stilness
of our station, and dulness of our constant dwelling in one place. And
no doubt they observed a method in their removalls, as there is a regu∣larity
as well in the motion of the Planets, as of the fixed Stars.


§ 4. For the generall we dare avouch they had 
Reuben
 and 
Gad
 on the
west, 
Moab
 on the south, 
Ammon
 on the north, the 
Ishmaelites
 or 
Hagarens
 on the east.
 Some place them more south, hard by the 
Dead-sea,
 but
therein surely mistake. For when
 
Gideon
 had the 
Midianites
 in chace
out of the land of 
Canaan,
 they betook not themselves southward (and
surely such Foxes when hunted would hast home to their own kennels)
but ran through the Tribe of 
Gad
 full east, to their proper habitations.
But now what a slender account shall we make of the towns and places
in 
Midian?
 But I conceive it better to present the Reader with a map
without cities, or those cities without names, then those names without
truth, or at least wise that truth without certainty, and a fair blank is to
be preferred before a full paper blurred over with falshoods.


§ 5. But first we doe behold those castles; and cities of 
Midian
 all on a
bright fire,
 burnt by 
Eleazer
 and the twelve thousand 
Israelites
 (where∣of
no
 one man slain in the action) wherein they killed all the males of
that countrey and females which had known man. What time also
they did execution on five Kings of 
Midian,
 and 
Balaam
 the false Prophet
their chaplain, who fell by the sword of
 man, though he had escaped
that of the
 Angell. Some may think strange, that the 
Israelites
 having
conquered this countrey possessed not themselves and their heirs thereof.
Let such know, first, that this sandy land was barren it self, whose best
fruitfulness consisted onely in the largeness thereof: Secondly, God in∣tended
an entire territory to his own people, whereas this stragling
Countrey was hardly kept, though easily conquered: Thirdly, the

Midianites
 were of the halfe bloud with the 
Israelites,
 descended from 
A∣braham,

and therefore God would not have them disinherit their kinsmen
of their possessions.



§6. If we goe out of their cities to take free aire in their countrey, see
how thick their tents are spread over the face of the earth. Whereof,
though their coverings might seem course, their courtains (mentioned
by the Prophet
) being both the side walls, and roof of their inward
rooms, were most costly and curious. As the 
Midianites
 were called 
the
children of the east,
 so none more orient in their apparell, and gorgeous ac∣coutrements.
For if their Camels wore
 Collers of gold about their
necks, how rich may their riders be presumed to be in pearles, and pre∣cious
stone?


§ 7. Another great part of their wealth consisted in their cattell, a∣mongst
which we must take speciall notice of their
 
Dromedaries,
 seeing
the most or best of this kind were bredhereabouts. A 
Dromedary
 is a dwarf∣camell,
nature recompensing his smalness in his swiftness, so that he will
travellan hundred miles a day, and continue at that rate with sparing diet
a week together. He hath but one bunch on his back (the Camell having
more) the naturall saddle for his Rider to mount upon, generally more
used for travell then bearing of burdens, and of as much more refined
service above Camells, as Hacknies are above Packhorses. In a word,
as in one respect this beast is the commendable character of perseve∣rance,
not fleet by fits, at the first; but holding out a constant and equall
tenour in travelling: so in another regard, it may pass for the emblem of
hypocrisie, pretending to both symptomes of a clean beast, really chew∣ing
the cud, and seemingly cleaving the hoof, but onely on the out side,
whereas
 within it is wholly fleshly, and entirely round like a platter.


§ 8. Yet all their speed could not save their Masters from the pursuit of

Gideon,
 when such a fatall blow was given to the 
Midianites,
 that the Text

saith, 
They lift up their heads no more.
 Yea, which is memorable scarce, any
part of their body appears afterwards in Scripture, or any mention of

 
Midianites
 (save with relation to the former defeate) which leads us to
this conjecture, that the remains of that nation, which escaped that
dismall overthrow, shrowded themselves under the names of some
neighbouring people, probably of the 
Ishmaelites,
 of whom but a word
or two, and so to 
Moab.


§ 9. Nor need the Reader be afraid to adventure amongst them,
suspecting the 
Ishmaelites,
 like 
Ishmael
 their Father, to be
 wild men, 
Whose
hands were against every man, and every mans hand against them;
 seeing their
fierceness and fury had been well tamed by the 
Reubenites, Gadites,
 and
half Tribe of 
Manasseh
 in that memorable victory, wherein no fewer
then an
 hundred thousand of them were taken captives, and those
Tribes dwelt in their tents even unto the river
 
Euphrates.
 Conceive it
in a cursory condition, onely grazing their cattell 
during the season,
 which
amounted not to a constant and settled habitation.


§ 10. The 
Ishmaelites
 were descended from 
Ishmael,
 otherwhiles cal∣led

Hagarens,
 wherein the difference not great; their former name be∣ing


fetched from their Father, the latter (but one degree further) from

Hagar,
 their grandmother. Of this 
Ishmael
 it was foretold, first that he
should 
dwell
 (as also he did
 
die) in the presence of all his brethren,
 that is, he
should not hide his head in holes, or creep into corners, as afraid of the
force of his neighbours, but should justifie and avouch his Right in o∣pen
habitations, daring and defying all pretenders to his possessions.
Secondly, it is said he should be
 
Onager homo
 or 
a wild-ass-man;
 in which
similitude (the holy Spirit not using casuall but choice comparisons)
surely very much is folded up of the Physiognomy both of him and his
posterity. Wild asses are said to carry a bow in their heels, and to finde
arrows in the sandy ground where they goe, wherein if hunted they doe
bestirre themselves with flinging the gravell behind them, that therewith
they pierce the breasts, yea sometimes
 split the heads of such as pursue
them: as the 
Ishmaelites
 excellent archers laid about them with their ar∣rows
to kill and slay such as opposed them.


§ 11. Large were the bounds alotted to 
Ishmael,
 and divine provi∣dence
which staked them down within certain limits, allowed them a
very long teddar, 
They
 dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is from before Egypt
till as thou goest towards Assyria:
 a spong of ground somewhat nigh a thou∣sand
miles, (perchance not so entire but interrupted with other nations)
and not bearing a proportionable breadth, consisting generally of the

Sandy and stony Arabia,
 so that a 
span
 of 
Isaacs
 was worth a 
stride
 of 
Ishmaels

possession. However, in relation to 
Ishmaels
 posterity that Prophecy,

he shall dwell in the presence of his brethren,
 admits also of this interpretation,
that the land alotted him ranged out so far, that the bounds and borders
thereof abutted on all his kindred, 
Edomites
 and 
Israelites
 his nephews or
brothers sons, 
Moabites
 and 
Ammonites
 his cousins once removed, 
Midia∣nites

descended of his half brother by 
Keturah,
 and 
Egyptians
 his near kins∣men
both by his wife and mother.


§ 12. In this large countrey did dwell the twelve
 sons of 
Ishmael,

which I may call the twelve tribes of the 
Ishmaelites.




1 Nebaioth.


2 Kedar.


3 Adbeel.


4 Mibsam.


5 Mishma.


6 Duma.


7 Massa.


8 Hadar.


9 Temah.


10 Ietur.


11 Naphish.


12 Kedemah.




A learned
 man from the allusion of letters and similtude of sounds
hath found out in 
stony, desert,
 and 
happy Arabia
 some places symbolizing
with these names; and I commend his industry, not daring altogether
to concur with his judgment; conceiving the subject in hand to want
a bottome for any to build with certainty thereupon. Sooner shall Chy∣mists

fixe quick-silver,
 then Geographers place these people in a setled habi∣tation.
Indeed mention is made of some
 
Townes
 and 
Castles
 (no cities)
they had, (perchance some strength to retire to) but generally
 Saint

Hierome
 tells us, they had neither doors nor bolts, but lived in tents in
desert places. Wherefore, as foreiners, for matter of clothes, paint an


Englishman with a pair of sheares in his hand, taxing therein his levity
in following fashions, continuing constant to no kind of apparell; so
we may present the 
Ishmaelites
 (besides a bow at their backs) with a
staffe in their hands, to intimate their ambulatory and ever-moving
condition. Here we may remember how 
Hagar
 being with child with

Ishmael,
 was
 found by the Angell wandering in the wilderness, and as
if the pregnant mothers condition had made an impression on her child
and his posterity, we find their home to be in a constant roving and
wandering in a desert Countrey. Leave we these 
Ishmaelites,
 and come
to men of a milder temper, and more fixed habitations, I mean the

Moabites.


§ 13. 
MOab
 Son and Gran-child of 
Lot,
 was incestuously begotten on
his edest daughter, in his
 drunkenness; after which act, no
more mention of 
Lot
 or what befel him in the history of the
Bible: (drunkenness makes men to forget and to be forgotten, drown∣ing
their memories in neglect and obscurity): onely after this, the new
Testament epithets him
 
Righteous Lot.
 That Spirit of meekness na∣ming
good men, not from the obliquity of some acts, but habituall inte∣grity
of their hearts. Yea, for love to 
Lot
 God granted many great fa∣vours
to the 
Moabites,
 assisting them to conquer the Giants
 
Emims,
 and
peaceably possessing them of their Countrey, with speciall
 command
to the 
Israelites
 not to disturb or molest them in this enjoiment thereof.


§ 14. Yet the 
Moabites
 ill requited 
Israels
 kindness unto them. That

falling out
 which was first begun betwixt the servants, and
 heardsmen,
was afterwards continued and increased betwixt the Sons and posterity
of 
Lot
 and 
Abraham.
 Yea upon all occasions the 
Moabites
 were 
backfriends

to 
Israel;
 witness 
Balak,
 who barked at, and 
Eglon
 who bit them, whom

Israel
 served
 
eighteen years.
 Note by the way, that under the Judges all
the heathen which bordered on 
Israel (Edom
 almost onely excepted, the
cause whereof hereafter)
 
Aramites,
 
Ammonites,
 
Midianites,
 
Philistines

&c. did all successively 
yrannize over 
Israel.
 No shrub growing about
on the banks of 
Canaan
 was so little, but it was big enough for God
thence to gather a Rod to whip his wanton children. Now if it be any
ease to the sick
man, to have his bed, not disease often altered, 
Israel
 had
the favour of exchange of tyrants and variety of oppressors; amongst
whom I dare say the 
Moabites
 were none of the mildest. More might be
said of their malice to the 
Iews,
 but I spare them for good 
Ruth,
 their
Countreywomans sake; who, when all her sister 
Orpha's
 complemen∣tall
Religion came off with a kiss,
 persevered to wait on 
Marah
 her mo∣ther-in-law
(for
 so she desired to be called) into 
the land of Canaan.


§ 15. But because the 
Moabites
 could not be perswaded to 
love, David

was the first who forced them to fear the Kings of 
Israel;
 
Moab is my
washpot,
 that is, one condemned to servile imployments: yea such was



Davids
 absolute command over this countrey, that he
 
measured the Mo∣abites
with a line, casting them down to the ground, even with two lines measured he
to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive.
 At the first sight he may
seem to have killed two, and saved one: A merciless proportion. But
on better consideration it may possibly be, that the preservative might
equal both the destructivelines, though not in number, in measure; as one
overflowing cup may contain as much as two sparingly filled. What
caused this severity in 
David
 against the 
Moabites
 the Scripture is silent,
and I had rather be so too then affirm with the presumptuous 
Rabbins

without warrant, that it was because the King of 
Moab
 had slain 
Davids

Father and Mother,
 whom he had left there for protection whilst 
Saul

persecuted him.


§ 16. If any object, this Act of 
David
 was a breach of Gods
 com∣mand,

Distresse not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battell,
 it is an∣swered,



1 This prohibition was temporary to 
Moses
 conducting the 
Isra∣elites,

that they should not molest 
Moab
 in their passage by his
countrey out of 
Egypt.


2 
Israel
 might not begin with offensive war to provoke them; but
being stricken might strike again, and follow their blow as

David
 did.

Moab
 might be distressed to subjection, not to ejection;
might be brought into obedience, not dispossessed of their coun∣trey.




After the defection of the ten Tribes from the house of 
David, Moab
 re∣mained
tributary to the 
Kings of Israel
 till the death of wicked but vali∣ant

Ahab.
 After which time, 
Moab
 rebelled, and though
 attempted
was never reduced into obedience by the Kings of 
Israel.


§ 17. 
Moab
 had the river 
Arnon
 on the north, the 
Dead-sea
 on the west,

Edom
 on the south, and 
Arabia
 on the east. It contained about a square of
an hundred miles, fit for grazing; and the peoples industry following
Natures guidance to their own profit, principally imployed it to that
use. Yea 
Mesha
 their King is tearmed a
 
sheep-master.
 Husbandry doth no
more eclipse the resplendent beams of Majesty, then the oile in the Lamp
hindreth the bright shining thereof. Guess the greatness of the 
Grist
 by
the 
Toll,
 the multitude of 
Moabs
 flocks from the Tribute he rendered to
the Kings of 
Israel, a
 hundred thousand Lambs, and a hundred thousand Rams
with the wooll.


§ 18. To come now to the particulardescription of 
Moab,
 let it not
be censured for a needless Tautology in this Map, that therein all the
cities of 
Reuben
 are again represented, being done deliberately on a
double consideration.




1 Formerly that land belonged to 
Moab
 before 
Sihon
 King of the

Amorites
 had forcibly wrested it away from them.



2 After the 
Reubenites
 were carried away captive by 
Tiglath-Pileser,

the 
Moabites
 reassumed their ancient possessions, as appears by
the
 Prophets.




As for the particular description of those cities, we remit the Reader
to what formerly hath been written in the Tribe of 
Reuben.


§ 19. In the north-east bound of 
Moab
 towards 
Midian in the border of
Arnon,
 which is in the utmost coasts,
 stood a nameless city, where 
Balak

met 
Balaam,
 standing as it were on his tiptoes on the very last labell of
his land, to reach forth welcome to that false Prophet, who hither rode
in state with his
 two men to attend him, whilst many Ministers of the

Truth
 are forced to be slaves to others, and servants to themselves. But
that these two men of 
Balaam
 were 
Iannes
 and 
Iambres
 the 
gyptian
 en∣chanters,
the 
Chaldee Paraphrase
 shall never perswade me, whilst the
distance of time and place; protest against the possibility thereof. Not
to say that it is likely that the sorcerers, so frequent in the presence of

Pharaoh,
 had long before waited on their Master through the red sea to
another world. Hence 
Balak
 conducted 
Balaam
 to
 
Kiriath-huzoth
 or
the city of streets, which at that time seems to be the Metropolis of

Moab.


§ 20. 
Mizpah
 of 
Moab
 followeth, where the Father and Mother of

David
 reposed themselves whilst their Son was persecuted by 
Saul. Ar

of 
Moab,
 and 
Rabbah
 of 
Moab
 were also places of great note in this land,
and besides these, many other cities of inferiour note. But as many
mean men living obscurely, so that the world takes no notice of them,
if surprized by some unusuall and strange mortality, become remarka∣ble
for their deaths, who were never memorable for their lives: so
some cities of 
Moab,
 whereof no mention in Scripture for any action
done in, or by them, are onely famous in holy writ, for their strange
ruine and destruction, by the Prophet sadly foretold, and therefore cer∣tainly
accomplished. Such are
 
Misgab, Horonaim, Luhith, Baith, Eglaim,
Ber-elim, Holon, Kirioth, Kirherez
 and
 
Madmen.
 The last as I conceive is
note-worthy, not for its own merit, but others mistake. For in the Bi∣bles,
and those numerous, printed 
Anno Dom.
 1625. the verse in 
Ieremy
 is
thus rendered, 
O Maiden the sword shall pursue thee;
 where the Corrector
of the Press conceiving it incongruous to join 
Thee
 a singular pronoune,
with 
Madmen
 (which he mistook for an appellative, no proper name)
ran himself upon that dangerous errour.


§ 21. But 
Kirharasheth
 seems the Metropolis of 
Moab.
 Near to this
three Kings, 
Iehoram
 of 
Iudah, Iehosaphat
 of 
Israel,
 and the nameless King∣deputy
of 
Edom,
 marched on a designe to chastise 
Mesha
 the rebellious
King of 
Moab
 into subjection. But wandring in the wilderness of 
Edom

they encountred a worse enemy, 
Thirst
 it self, wherewith all of them
were ready to saint. But happily it happened that 
Elisha,
 
who powred
water on the hands of Eliah,
 by the same Element seasonably refreshed the


hearts of the distressed armies, respecting 
Iehosaphat
 for his own good∣ness,
the other two Kings for his company. How many generall bene∣fits
doe the very 
Tares
 enjoy, because inseparably mingled with the

Wheat
 in the field of this world? Yea, 
Elisha
 was an instrument to give
them, not onely water, but victory (heavens favours goe commonly
by couples) after this miraculous manner.


§ 22. The 
Moabites
 beholding water miraculously brought in that
place, where never any was seen or known before, and the same at di∣stance
appearing
 red unto them, (guilded with the beames of the Sun)
concluded it to be bloud, and that that 
Paroyall of Armies
 had smitten
one another. Wonder not that their conjecture was so wide and wild,
for well might the Comment be out of the way of Truth, when the
Text was out of the Rode of nature, and the 
Moabites
 on the suddain not
capable to suspect a miracle. Hereupon the word is given,
 
Moab to the
spo
le,
 which in some sense was true, that is, not to 
take
 but 
become the spoile

of others. For the tents they assaulted, being lined with armed men,
quickly overcame them. And it is worth our observing, that this victo∣ry
was bestowed on 
Iehosaphat
 (my eyes are onely on him, on whom
alone the
 looks of 
Elisha
 reflected) just in the morning when the
 
Meat∣offering
was offered,
 as procured by the Propitiatory virtue thereof; all fa∣vours
being conferred in and for the merits of Christ the truth of all
sacrifices.


§ 23. God gave, man used this conquest. Improving their success,
they
 
beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land, cast every man his stone,
and filled it, and stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees.
 This was
contrary to Gods express
 command; but none could better dispense
with the Law, then the lawgiver, who in detestation of the rebellion of

Moab
 against 
Israel
 enjoined this severity. Onely the City of 
Kirharash∣eth

was left, and that they besieged, untill the King of 
Moab
 therein took
and sacrificed his eldest Son,
 who was to succeed him: either out of a
bad imitation of 
Iephthah;
 (and their Idols we know were adored
with sacrifices of men) or to give assurance to the besiegers, that they
were men resolved to endure all extremities, so that they might presume
he that would sacrifice his Son would not spare to spend his souldiers
on any desperate adventure. Hereupon the foresaid three Kings surcea∣sed
their siege: either out of policy, perceiving the same desperate, and
unlikely to prevaile; or out of a royall sympathy, that it was revenge e∣nough
to distress, though not destroy a King or (which is most proba∣ble)
out of a religious horrour (the trembling whereat made their
swords fall out of their hands) as unwilling to provoke the besieged
any further to such impious, and unhumane performances; lest heaven
should arraign them as accessary thereunto, by giving the occasion there∣of:
whatsoever was the cause, home they returned, content with the
spoiling, without the finall conquering of the Countrey.



§ 24. Many are the invectives of the Prophets against 
Moab
 for their
sins. The people thereof are charged 
to have been at ease from their youth, and
setled on their
 less, because not emptied from vessell to vessell,
 neither carried in∣to
captivity (whilest poor 
Israel
 was posted from 
Canaan
 to 
Egypt,
 from

Egypt
 to 
Canaan,
 from 
Canaan
 to 
Babylon,
 from 
Babylon
 to 
Canaan,
 back∣ward,
and forward) God therefore threatneth, because they had not

been emptied from their vessell, to
 break them
 in their vessell, and foretelleth
that 
Moab should be made
 drunk
 (haply alluding to his geniture seeing he
was begotten in a fit of drunkenness) 
and wallow
 in his vomit; and
come to utter destruction. Thus never to be acquainted with any affli∣ction
in youth, is a certain prognostick of finall confusion in old age.
So much for 
Moab,
 leaving it to learned men to dispute, what is intended
by the
 restauration of 
Moab
 foretold in the latter days; as also let them
enquire whether that passage in
 
Daniel,
 that after a generall overthrow,

Edom, Moab &c. should escape,
 must not mystically be meant of the enemies
of the Church, in which sense we may be sure, the devill will have a

Moab,
 as long as God hath any 
Israel
 in the world.


§ 25. 
AMmon
 another base Son of 
Lot,
 had 
Midian
 on the east, 
Moab

on the south, 
Gad
 on the west, and 
Syria
 on the north: a cir∣cular
countrey extending about sixty miles every way. The
ancient inhabitants hereof were the Giants
 
Zamz
mmims.
 These were
conquered and cast out by the 
Ammonites,
 who afterwards dwelt in their
countrey, being a fruitfull land, and too good for these 
Ammonites
 that
bare an inveterate malice to the people of 
Israel,
 manifested in many
particulars.




1 In their oppressing them
 eighteen years till 
Iephthah
 gave them
deliverance.


2 In their cruell conditions (such Ravens and birds of prey first
peck out the eyes) tendered to the men of
 
Iabesh-Gilead.


3 In their barbarous abusing 
Davids
 ambassadours.


4 In ripping
 up the bellies of the women with child in 
Gilead.


5 In their 
Clapping
 
their hands, stamping with their feet, and rejoycing in
their heart
 at the sacking of 
Ierusalem
 by the King of 
Babylon.


6 In their contriving the destruction of
 
Gedaliah,
 and the poor
remnant of the 
Iews
 left behind in the land by the 
Babylonians.


7 In
 retarding the building of the Temple after the 
Iews
 return
from captivity.




And although 
David
 and some other Kings, amongst whom 
Uzziah

most remarkeable, forced the 
Ammonites
 to give them
 gifts; yet we may
justly beleeve the same were presented rather with their hands then
their hearts, bearing a cordiall grudge against 
Israel.


§ 26. 
Rabbah
 was the Metropolis of 
Ammon,
 called in Scripture the

tity of waters,
 because low and plashy in its situation, conducing much


to the strength thereof, rendering all undermining of it uneffectuall. But
perchance it is so termed from the extraordinary populousness thereof,

Waters
 being often used for 
People
 in Scripture phrase, both being at all
times unstable and unconstant, and when they get a head implacable,
neither speaking nor hearing reason; both usefull servants, but intolera∣ble
Masters. Here the 
Iron-bed
 of 
Og
 was preserved for a Relick, being

 nine cubits high and four broad. Now though 
Alexanders
 souldiers
are said to have left shields in 
India,
 far greater then those which they
did or could weare in war, onely to possess posterity with a false opini∣on
that his men were mightier then they were, yet we may presume
this bed of 
Og
 was not unproportionably greater then he necessarily
used for his ordinary repose. No doubt 
Og
 confident of his own strength
certainly concluded, that as he did often lie in health upon that bed, so
he should quietly die on the same, whereas contrary to his expectation
he was slain in the field, and now his bed served him for a 
Cenotaph
 or
empty monument.


§ 27. This 
Rabbah
 was besieged by 
Ioab,
 to revenge 
Hanun
 King of
the 
Ammonites
 his despitefull usage of 
Davids
 Ambassadours. Here 
Uriah

engaged in battell was killed, though not conquered, by the treacherous
retreat of
 his own countreymen. What a deal of doe was here to bring
one innocent man to his grave? 
Davids
 wicked designe, 
Ioabs
 unwor∣thy
compliance, 
Ammons
 open force, 
Israels
 secret fraud, and yet all too
little, had not 
Uriah's
 own credulous simplicity, unspotted loyalty, un∣daunted
courage rather to die then to fly, concurred to hasten his own
destruction. Afterwards 
Ioab
 having brought the city to terms of yeeld∣ing,
politickly sends for 
David
 solemnly to take his place, to decline all
envy from himself, and invest all honour on his Soveraign. Here the
glorious Crown of this kingdome was taken, and set on 
Davids
 head:
and I dare boldly say it became 
David
 better, then him from whom
 it
was taken. But (oh!) what a Bridewell or house of correction was
provided for the people of this place! 
They were
 put under saws, and under har∣rows
of Iron, and under axes of Iron, and made to passe through the brick kilne.
 See
here 
Davids
 patience provoked into fury. And was it not just that they
who would not civilly, like men, use 
Davids
 Ambassadours, should by

Davids
 men be barbarously used, like beasts, in slavish imployments?


§ 28. The most populous part of the Kingdome of 
Ammon
 lay be∣twixt

Aroer
 and 
Minnith,
 containing no fewer then twenty Cities, (so ma∣ny
represented in our Map) and had I found their names in Scripture,
I had imparted them to the Reader. All these
 cities were smote by

Iephthah
 that most valiant Judge of 
Israel.
 For he 
passed over
 to the enemy
to fight with them, other Judges onely expelling them out of 
Israel,
 and
pursuing them to their own countrey. An action of very much prowess
in 
Iephthah
 to rowze those wild beasts in their own den, and no less po∣licy,
preventing the spoiling of his native soil, and translating the 
Seat


of the war
 into the land of a forein so. Here if any demand how the wheat
of 
Minnith
 comes to be reckoned by the
 Prophet, amongst the staple
commodities of the land of 
Iudah,
 wherewith she bartered with 
Tyre,

when 
Minnith
 was
 undoubtedly a city of the 
Ammonites;
 it is answered.
1 This fine wheat might first be denominated from 
Minnith
 as origi∣nally
growing there, though afterwards as good and more of that kind
grew generally in 
Iudea.
 Thus some flowers, and fruits, 
Province-Roses,
Burgamo peares &c.
 are as full and fair in other countreys as in that
place whence they take their name. 2 By 
Minnith-wheat
 may be meant,
wheat winnowed, cleansed, and dressed after the fine and curious
fashion of 
Minnith.
 Thus they are called 
Hungar-dollars,
 which are re∣fined
to the standard of 
Hungarian
 gold, in what place or by what Prince
soever in 
Germany
 they be coined.


§ 29. We must not forget that after the Tribe of 
Gad
 was carried a∣way
captive by 
Tiglath-pileser,
 the 
Ammonites
 seised on and dwelt in the
cities of that Tribe. For which reason so many of them are set down in
this our Map. This caused the complaint of the
 Prophet; 
Hath Israel
no sons? Hath he no heire? Why then doth their King inherit Gad, and his people
dwell in his cities?
 Sure I am that 
Ammon
 double barred with bastardy
and incest, though somewhat allied, could never legally succeed to the
possessions of 
Israel.
 But in such cases, the keenest sword is next to the
kin. Not to say that 
Ammon
 had a title to that kingdome, before that

Sihon
 King of the 
Amorites
 took that land away from them, whereof
largely before in the description of 
Gad.
 If any aske me what became
of the 
Ammonites
 in after ages; I answer with 
David, he
 
passed away, and
loe he was not, yea I
 
sought him, but he could not be found.
 Yea the less there ap∣pears of 
Ammon,
 the more there appears of Gods justice, and di∣vine
truth, foretold by the mouth of
 
Ezekiel, I will cut thee off from the
people, and will cause thee to perish out of the countreys.


§ 30. 
Esau
 eldest Son of 
Isaac
 was 
red and hairy
 at his birth; the one
shewing his irefull nature, the other his hardy constitution. He was
highly beloved of his Father (whilest 
Iacob
 was Gods and his Mothers
darling) chiefly for providing him
 Venison: a consideration beneath
so good a man, and for which 
Isaac
 smarted afterwards, sawcing each
morsell of his Sons venison in his own teares, caused by 
Esaus
 unhap∣py
 matches, and undutifull demeanour. This 
Esau
 is as generally
known in Scripture, by the name of 
Edom
 given him on this occasion.
Coming one day hungry from hunting he sold his birthright to his bro∣ther

Iacob
 for
 red pottage, 
red
 being 
Edom
 in Hebrew. I confess many
flaws may be found in this bargain and sale, as namely,



1 It was no faire but fraudulent dealing for 
Iacob
 to surprize his
brother, taking advantage of his hunger.


2 The contract was not made on a valuable compensation; not to
say it was Simoniacall to sell or buy such heavenly priviledges.



3 The heires of 
Esau,
 (as yet in his loines) concerned therein, but
not consenting thereto, might justly question their Fathers grant
in passing away what by nature was intailed upon them.




Wherefore it is safest to turn all our excusing of 
Iacob
 into our admi∣ring
of Gods wisdome, who makes mens crooked actions to tend in a
streight line to his own glory. And yet we must not forget, that even after

Esau
 had satisfied himself with food, the text saith, 
Thus
 
Esau despised his
birthright.
 It seems thereby, that what his hast and hunger had conveyed
his profaneness did deliberately confirme, and by that his neglect and
contempt, 
he acknowledged a Fine,
 cutting off his heires from any recovery
thereof. Indeed afterwards 
Esau
 made it a main matter of
 quarrell with
his brother, but never a matter of conscience in himself. But enough
hereof: onely I will adde the crossing of the common rule, 
Caveat ven∣ditor,

let here 
the seller beware,
 for God took 
Esau
 at his word, and accor∣dingly deprived him of his birthright.


§ 31. But 
Esau
 set a greater valuation on his 
Blessing,
 wherein be∣ing
prevented by 
Iacob,
 he 
sought it with teares,
 though they were not a

kindely showre of repentance,
 but onely some heate drops of anger and in∣dignation, not so much grieved that he had lost, as vexed that 
Iacob
 had
gotten the 
Blessing.
 At last his importunity got from his Father a 
Blessing

though not 
the blessing,
 the severall clauses whereof we are seriously to
consider, because thereon dependeth the right understanding of the con∣ditions
of the people and countrey of 
Edom,
 which we are now to de∣scribe.


Behold
 thy dwelling shall be the fatnesse of the earth, and
of the dew of heaven from above.


Earth
 is by 
Isaac
 first mentioned because by 
Esau
 most minded. But
oh the difference betwixt the 
dew of heaven
 in
 
Iacobs
 and 
Esau's
 blessing!
In the former it signified Gods favour with an undoubted right unto,
and sanctified use of divine promises, service and Sacraments: whereas
in this blessing of 
Esau, heavenly dew,
 was in effect, but earthly dew, tempo∣rall
terrestriall fertility allowed to this mountainous land of 
Edom,
 whose
lean hils were larded with many fruitfull vallies interposed. Heathen
Authors confesse no less;


Dulce nemus florentis
 Idumes.


The fair grove of flourishing
Idumea.


Quicquid nobile Ponticis nucetis


Foecundis cadit aut jugis
 Idumes.


What ever noble worth destils


On Pontus nut-trees, or what fils


The fruitfull Idumean Hils.


However, divine providence seems to have suited the Countreys to
the conditions of 
Isaacs
 children, giving 
plain-dealing Iacob
 a more low
and levell Land, and fitting the haughty minde of aspiring 
Esau
 with
high-swelling and ambitious mountains, though he who was nearest
to heaven, was farthest from God.



And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt be thy Brothers Servant.


It is observable, that though God in the time of the Judges, made
use of almost all other heathen nations, bordering on the 
Iewes,
 succes∣sively
to oppress that his own people (
Midianites, Ammonites, Moabites,
Philistines
 &c.) Yet he never permitted the 
Edomites
 at any time to Lord
it over 
Israel,
 because (according to 
Isaacs
 Blessing) subjection to 
Iacob,

not soveraignty over him belonged to 
Esau,
 and his posterity. This
prophecy of 
Esau's
 serving 
Iacob
 was fully accomplished in the days of

David,
 
when he put a
 
Garison in Edom, throughout all Edom put he souldiers, and
all they of Edom became Davids servants;
 and so remained tributaries to the
Kings of 
Iudah
 and governed by their deputies for one hundred and
fifty years and upwards.


But it shall come to passe, when thou shalt get the mastery, that
thou shalt breake his yoke from thy neck.


This was fulfilled when the 
Edomites
 rebelling against King
 
Iehoram,

finally recovered their liberty, whilest he (more cruell to kill his bre∣thren
at home, then valiant to conquer his enemies abroad) could ne∣ver
after reduce them into subjection, nor his successors after him.


§ 32. The 
Horims
 first inhabited this Countrey of 
Mount Seir;
 whose
Dukes are reckoned up by
 
Moses,
 of whom Duke 
Anah
 is most remar∣kable
for his first finding out of 
Mules,
 
as he fed his Father Zibions Asses:

A creature (or rather a living beast) which may be called a 
reall fallacy
 in
nature, whose extraction is a conclusion unduely inferred from the
premises of an Hee-asse and a Mare joined together. Yet this is com∣mendable in 
Mules;
 they imitate rather the virtues then vices of their
Sire, and Dam, having in them, the dulness of the Asse, quickened with
the metall of the Mare, and the Mares stubbornness corrected with the
Asses patience. Barren they are (as to whom God never granted the

Charter of increase
) and yet
 
Pliny
 reports (but it is 
Pliny
 who reports it)
that in 
Rome Mules
 are often recorded to beare young ones, but then al∣ways
accounted ominous. Let others dispute whether 
Anah
 was the

Inventour,
 or onely the 
Repertour
 of Mules, the industrious 
Founder,
 or
the casuall 
Finder
 of them: Let them also discuss whether such copula∣tions
be lawfull, for men of set purpose to joine together severall kinds,
which God hath parted asunder; yea they may seem to amount to a
tacite upbraiding of Gods want of wisdome or goodness, in not pro∣viding
sufficient Creatures for mans service, without such 
monstrous ad∣ditionals

in nature. If they be concluded unlawfull, let them argue whe∣ther
the constant use of Mules,
 be not continuing in a known sin; and
yet some good men in Scripture, rather then they would goe on foot,
used to ride on them, though our Saviour
 himself accepted of a plaine
Asse for his own Saddle.


§ 33. These
 
Horims
 were at last conquered and ex
irpated by the

Edomites, who succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead.
 The civill government


of the land of 
Edom
 was sometimes Ducall, sometimes Regall. 
Moses

reckoning up
 eleven 
Edomite Dukes,
 leaveth it doubtfull, whether they
were successively one after another, or went all a brest, as living at the
same time, (which is most probable) and so the land divided into 
Ele∣ven
Dukedomes.
 This is most certain that eight severall Kings reigned in

Edom
 one after another, and all
 
before there reigned any King over the chil∣dren
of Israel.
 Thus the wicked 
as they have their portion in this world;
 so
they quickly come to full age to possess the same, whilest Gods children
are long children, long kept in nonage, and brought up in the 
School of
affliction.
 Now it is recorded in
 Scripture that every 
Edomite
 King had
successively a severall city of his royall residence, namely





Kings


Parentage


Royall-city.






Bela


The son of 
eor


Dimhabah.






Iobab


The son of 
Zerah


Bozrah.






Husham


of the land of 
Temani


Teman.






Hadad


The son of 
Bedad


Avith.






Samla


 


Masr
kah.






Shaut


 


R
hoboth
 by the river.






Baal-banan


The son of 
Achbor


 






Hada


 


Pan.






It is plain those Kings were not by succession, and probably they
were not by election, but onely by strength and power as they could
make their parties, according to 
Isaacs
 prediction,
 
By thy sword shalt thou
live.
 Now this their frequent removall of their royal City was politickly
done.




1 To declare the fulnes and freedome of their power and pleasure,
that they were not confined to follow the footsteps of their pre∣decessours.


2 To disperse and communicate civility and courtship into all
the parts of their kingdome.


3 To honour and adorne the place of their birth, for probably
their native, was their royall city.


4 To cut off from one place the occasion of suspicious greatness;
Politicians having found in their theory, and Princes perchance
felt in their practise the danger thereof.




§ 34. And now we come to the particular description of the Land
of 
Edom
 called also 
Mount-Seir, Dumah,
 and 
Idumea
 in the Scripture.

Mount Seir
 is as much as 
Mons hispidus,
 or 
hirsutus,
 a rough and rug∣ged
mountain. So called some conceive from 
Esau,
 who Satyr-like
had a quickset of hair on his body, though it seems the place was
so
 named long before he came to possesse it as brisling with bushes
and overgrown with wood, in the famous wilderness thereof, name∣ly
of



1 
Teman.
 The inhabitants hereof were, or were accounted (of
themselves or others) very wise. 
Is
 
wisdome no more in Teman?

Yet all their carnall policy could not preserve them from utter
destruction there threatned unto them. 
Eliphaz
 one of
 
Iobs
 friends
was of this Countrey.



2 
Dedan.
 Such as dwelt therein were merchants,
 and did drive a
land trade with 
Tyrus,
 bringing thither 
precious clothes, for chariots;

or, 
in
 chariots.


3 
Edom,
 
. Herein the three Kings wandered and were
distressed for want of water, till 
Elisha
 relieved them.




As for the other two names of this Countrey 
Dumah
 and 
Id
mea,
 for∣merly
largely thereof.


§ 35. 
Edom
 had the Dead-sea and 
Moab
 on the north-east, 
Arabia deserta

on the east, the wilderness of 
Paran
 on the north-west, and the 
Red-sea

on the south-west. A sea not so called from the redness of the water
thereof, (yet I know not how it may appear, when beheld with bloud∣shot
eyes) nor from a King 
Eruthraeus,
 (for what makes a Greek name
so long since in these eastern parts?) but from
 
Edom,
 or 
Rufus
 the red
son of 
Iacob,
 commanding in this countrey, so that 
Red sea
 is all one
with the 
Edomite
 or 
Idumean Sea.
 In Hebrew it is termed 
Iam Suph
 or the

flaggy sea,
 because of the plenty of flags, reeds and weeds found therein,
though of the last never so many, as when the wicked 
Egyptians
 were
drowned therein. 
Ezion-gaber
 is a fair haven of great commerce on this
sea. Here 
Solomon
 had his navy royall, which jointly with the ships of

Hiram,
 brought four hundred and twenty talents of gold from 
Ophir.
 This
it seems was the sum paid 
de claro
 into the Kings Exchequer, otherwise
thirty talents more are mentioned,
 probably expended in defraying the
cost of the voyage. Long after 
Iehosaphat
 joining with 
Ahaziah,
 hence
set forth ships for the same purpose, to the same place, 
but they
 
went not,
for they were broken.
 Why the seas which smiled on 
Solomon,
 should
frown on godly 
Iehosaphat,
 I durst not conjecture (lest my adventuring
in guessing, prove as unsuccessefull as his in sailing) had not
 Scripture
plainly told me, that the winds and the waves forbad the Banes of
matching Gods children with Idolaters in the same designe. Yea the
breath of 
Eliezer
 the Prophet, may be said to have sunk those ships, threa∣tening
their destruction. Thus those shall never reap good harvest,
who plow with an Oxe and an Asse, contrary to Gods flat
 command.
Afterwards, wicked King 
Ahaziah
 requested again of 
Iehosaphat,
 
Let my
servants goe with thy servants in the ships,
 but the other refused, having foundas
bad success with the son at sea, as lately he had had on land with 
Ahab
 his
Father. Besides, 
Iehosaphat
 being sensible how his infant-designe was
strangled in the wombe, and his ships broken at 
Ezion gaber
 in the very
haven, would not renew his voyage, it being a bold defying of divine
power, to water that project from earth, which one plainly sees blasted
from heaven.


§ 36. Other remarkable places in 
Edom
 were, first Mount 
Hor
 (hap∣ly
so called from the 
Horims
 ancient inhabitants thereof) where 
Aaron

put off his clothes the covering of his body, and his
 body the clothes
of his soul, and 
Eleazar
 his son both buried and succeeded him. Thus


though for his disobedience forbidden the entrance of the land of

Canaan,
 yet he came to the selvedge or out-skirt thereof, for hard
by, the Tribe of 
Iudah
 with a narrow spong confined on the king∣dome
of 
Edom.
 2
ly
 
The valley of salt,
 at the south end of the 
Dead
Sea,
 where God twice seasoned the 
Edomites,
 with two sharp and
smart overthrows, when 
Abishai
 killed eighteen thousand, and
afterwards when
 
Amaziah
 killed ten thousand of them in the same
place. 3
ly
 
Zair
 is not far off; where King 
Ioram
 of 
Iudah
 gave
the 
Edomites
 a great blow, though he could not bring them again
into a full subjection. 4
ly
 More south, 
Bozrah
 the metropolis of

Edom.
 The name thereof signifieth a muniment or fortification,
(hence so many of them in these parts) and it was a place of great
strength and renown. The Prophet speaking of Christ returning in
triumph from overcoming his enemies: 
Who is this
 (saith
 he) 
that
cometh from Edom, with red garments from Bozrah?
 But oh the difference
(though the colour be the same) betwixt the 
manner of the die,
 when

Christ
 came 
red
 a sufferer, and 
red
 a conquerour, the latter from 
Boz∣rah,

but the former from 
Ierusalem!


§ 37. Yet 
Bozrah
 carrieth it not so clear to be chiefe in this Coun∣trey,
but that 
Sclah
 is a stiffe corrivall with it for the same honour.
This Hebrew name signifies a 
Rock,
 in which sense it is called 
Petra

in Greek and Latine, (I say not that 
Arabia
 is thence denominated

Petraea
) standing on a steep hill, from the precipice whereof, 
Ama∣ziah

threw ten thousand 
Edomites, and they
 all burst to pieces;
 where∣of
before; a cruell act, yet admitting of a better excuse, then ano∣ther
he committed in this kingdome in adoring the captive 
Idols
 of
Edom,
 and setting them up to be worshipped in 
Iudah:
 Did he think
that as some trees gain more strength by being transplanted; so these
Gods would get new vigour by being removed into another coun∣trey?


Petra
 was by 
Amaziah
 named 
Ioktheel,
 and is called 
Crach
 at
this day, having lately been used for a place, therein to secure the trea∣sure
of the 
Sultan.


§ 38. So much of 
Edom:
 whose ancient antipathy against 
Israel

continued and increased to the last. Witness, 
their standing in the cross
ways to
 cut off them of Iudah which should escape, and shut up the remnant
in the day of affliction.
 God in conclusion was even with them: for
as they 
had cast
 lots upon Ierusalem,
 so at last they drew such 
a blank

for themselves, that notwithstanding their
 
Eagles-nests
 and starry-dwellings
(wherein they placed their confidence) they were brought
to destruction, their high habitations being so far from saving them,
that they onely contributed to make their fall more visible to others,
and dangerous to themselves.


§ 39. East of 
Edom
 lay the Land of 
Uz,
 where 
Iob
 dwelt, so renow∣ned
for his patience, when the devill heaped afflictions upon him, al∣lowing


him no lucid intervalls. Onely the more deliberately to tor∣ment
him, measured unto him, so much space betwixt his severall stripes,
that 
Iob
 might be distinctly sensible of the smart thereof. Yea this fa∣ther
of confusion observed a methodicall gradation in doing mischief,
that still the hindmost was the heaviest affliction.




1 The
 
Sabeans,
 a people of 
Arabia the happy,
 took away 
his Oxen
when plowing, and Asses when feeding besides them.


2 Fire of hell falling from heaven (of Satans sending, and Gods
suffering)
 consumed his sheep and servants.


3 The 
Chaldeans
 coming in three bands fell on his Camels, and
carried
 them away. If any object that 
Chaldea
 was many miles
hence; it is answered that roving crafty theeves have long strides,
and commonly fox-like, prey farthest from their den. Besides,
probably the 
Chaldeans
 driving a land-trade from 
Arabia
 to 
Baby∣lon

with Spices, being Merchant-pirates, did light on this prize
in their passage.


4 A winde smote 
the four
 corners
 of the house wherein his seven
sons were feasting with their three sisters: Nor will any won∣der
at this wild 
Hericano
 blowing at once from all points of the
Compass, when he remembers that 
Satan
 is styled 
the
 Prince of
the power of the aire.


5 His body became an Hospitall of diseases, equally painfull,
shamefull, loathsome. How quickly is 
Dives
 turned into 
La∣zarus?

as if his heards of cattell were turned into
 boiles, and
flocks of sheep into so many Scabs on his body.


6 His wife persecuted him with her bad
 counsell. When the
physick which should help, traiterously sides with the disease;
Oh the dolefull condition of the Patient!


7 Lastly, his friends proved his greatest enemies. Others onely
despoiled him of his goods, they sought to deprive him of his
goodness. And whereas 
Iob
 was onely passive in his other
losses, (plundered of all his wealth against his will) they ende∣voured
to perswade him voluntarily to resigne and surrender his
innocence and integrity, and to confess himself an hypocrite;
For to this purpose tended their large discourses containing true
Doctrines, but false Uses, as applied in relation to 
Iob.




All these crosses 
Iob
 bare with invincible patience. Insomuch that
some Moderns accounting such patience impossible, have turned it all
into a Parable, denying the historicall, and onely making an Allegori∣call
truth of all his sufferings; dealing worse with 
Iob,
 then the devili∣did,
whose commission extended not to take away his
 life; whereas
these men utterly destroy his beeing, denying such an one ever
to have been in 
Rerum natura.
 See the baseness of our degenerate
days, being so far from following the worthy example of former


Heroes, that mens laziness takes a more compendious way, in stead
of imitating their virtues, practise to abolish their persons. And
yet what clearer demonstration can there be of the historicall truth of

Iob,
 then that his own name, the name of the place of his dwelling
are set down, with the names of his foes, friends, and daughters; and
the whole History as largely recorded in the 
old,
 as briefly repeated
in the 
new
 
Testament?
 On the other side we listen as little to those
who lessen 
Iobs
 sufferings, because he lost nothing with in doors, his
Coin, Jewels, Plate, and houshold-stuffe (presumed in a conside∣rable
equipage to the rest of his substance) remained entire for any
thing we finde to the contrary. But the wealth of that age chiefly
consisted in their stock, so that one may call their cattell their coin,
(Grammarians derive 
Pecunia à pecudibus
) bargains in those days not
being driven with money 
in specie,
 but by bartering of commodities.


§ 40. But Comicall was the end of 
Iob,
 and all things restored
double to him:
 so that it had been better for him to have lost more;
for then he should have had twice as much restored: onely the same
number of children were given him, seven sons and three daughters,
because his former children, 
non amissi, sed praemissi,
 were not foregone,
but gone before. Parents may account on their pious children depar∣ted,
and reckon, not that once they had, but still have them; though not
here, in heaven. Yea in some sort 
Iobs
 children were doubled also, be∣cause
he lived to see his sons sons to the 
fourth
 
generation.
 As for the
friends of 
Iob: Eliphaz
 the 
Temanite
 (of whom formerly) lived in 
Edom:
Bildad
 the 
Shubite
 dwelt hereabouts, as descended from
 
Shuah
 one of

Abrahams
 sons by 
Keturah: Zophar
 the 
Naamathite
 from 
Naamah
 a City after
allotted to 
Iudah,
 on the south of 
Iudea
 bordering in 
Edom
.


§ 41. Here I omit the Countrey of 
Temah
 with some other petty ter∣ritories,
all parcels of 
Arabia deserta.
 Yea the Reader may stand on the
edge of this Map, and there smell the fragrancies of 
Arabia the happy,
 so
called on good reason. 
Misers
 measure Paradise by their profit, 
Epicures

by their pleasure: both met here. And it is hard to say whether the

spices
 or the 
gold
 of the countrey are more renowned. But if heaven
should commence an action against 
Arabia the happy
 for usurping his
priviledge, 
Arabia
 would 
non-sute
 it self, and confess her unhappiness in
the midst of all her felicity. For in default of other fuell they are fain
to burn and dress their meat with Aromaticall wood, which so stupefi∣eth
the senses of the people, that they are forced with
 
Bitumen
 and the
sent of 
Goates
 (where perfumes are too frequent, a stink is a perfume)
to qualifie their suffocating sweetness. Thus no heaven out of heaven,
and no earthly felicity will fall out even measure to content us, but either
too much or too little.


§ 42. It remaineth now that we observe the severall stations of the
children of 
Israel
 coming out of 
Egypt,
 which cross this map in fashion


of a Belt. We begin at mount 
Hor
 their thirty fourth stage in the edge of
the land of 
Edom.
 Hence 
Moses
 sent messengers to request a peaceable
passage through the kingdome of 
Edom,
 but could not obtain it. No
doubt they were jealous of 
Israels
 greatness, and being carnally suspici∣ous
of them (because Power generally performeth promises, no further
then it complies with its profit) conceived it easier to keep, then cast
them out of their countrey. If
 
Iacob
 was frighted with 
Esau's
 coming
to meet him with four hundred men, 
Esau
 was now no less afraid of

Iacob
 accosting him with six hundred thousand men.


§ 43. However, God commanded his people not to force this, but
finde another passage. It was well more ways then one led to 
Canaan,

else 
Israel
 had been at a losse. But wicked men may for a time retard, not
finally obstruct our access to happiness. It is but fetching a compass,
making two steps for one; a little more pains and patience will doe the
deed. 
Israel
 surrounds the land of 
Edom,
 and next sets down at 
Zal∣mona.


§ 44. Here they want water, and fall a muttering, and God sends
them more fire in lieu thereof,
 
Fiery Serpents
 to destroy them. Humble
praying is the onely means to remove; peevish muttering, the ready
way to double our distress. Yet afterwards by the setting up of the 
bra∣zen
Serpent,
 their malady was remedied. Suddain wound, to be hurt
with a touch; and as quick a cure, to be healed with a look! Oh lively
type of our Saviours death! Here is both Christ and his Cross; both
his Person, and the manner of his Passion, he 
must be lifted up. Zalmona

in Hebrew signifieth 
the shadowing of a portraicture;
 probably so named
from the Effigies of the Serpent set up in this place. As for the five fol∣lowing,

 
Phunon, Oboth, Iie-abarim, Dibon-gad,
 and 
Almon-diblathaim,
 we
finde no memorable accident happening at them.


§ 45. These solemn Gests were, as I may say, the 
full points,
 which
distinguished the severall sentences of the Jewish Peregrination. But
besides these there were certain 
Comma's
 or 
Colons,
 I mean intermediate
subordinate Stages, where they did baite, not lodge; or perchance
lodge for a night, not live any time. Thus after 
Iie-abarim,
 their 88
th
.
Stage, they pitched successively in



1 The valley of
 
Zared.


2 By the stream of 
Arnon.


3 At 
Beer.


4 Mattanah.


5 Nahaleel.


6 Bamoth.




Betwixt 
Kadesh-barnea
 and the valley of 
Zared
 the space of time
was
 
thirty and eight years,
 and at 
Beer
 was that famous well, which
the Princes 
digged with their staves
 (Ensignes of authority are not
degraded,
 if sometimes used as instruments of industry) except any


will say, that with their staves they onely pointed out the place, and
gave direction to others. As for the reasons why the 
Israelites
 were
a long time in going so little way, insomuch that that beast
in 
Brasile,
 which in fourteen
 days goes no further then
a man may throw a stone (therefore called
by the Spaniards 
Pigritia
) might o∣vertake
them; the reasons
hereof in the following
Map shall be pre∣sented
us.


Here the Map of the wilderness of 
Paran
 is to be inserted.


















THE WILDERNESS OF
PARAN. CHAP. 3.


§ 1. 
T
He wilderness of
 
Paran
 (wherein a principal
place called 
Phara
 in the days of
 
Ptolemy
) is part
of
 
Arabia the stony,
 hath 
Iudea
 and the 
Mediterra∣nean-sea,

on the north; 
Egypt,
 on the west; the

Red-sea,
 on the south-west and full south; 
Ara∣bia
the desert,
 and therein the kingdome of 
Edom,

on the east. An ocean as (I may say) of sand, whereof it hath incon∣stant
tides, removed in drifts, by the violence of the winds, to the great
danger of travellers; without water, or wood, save a few Anchorite∣palme-trees
scattered here and there, whereof a whole convent seventy
in number, was found at 
Elim,
 therefore signally noted in
 Scripture,
as a remarkable rarity; other wood hath it none, saith the
 Geogra∣pher,
save Thorn and Tamerisk, and of the former sort (I conceive)
that
 bush was, nigh 
Horeb,
 which burnt, and never consumed.


§ 2. Here was 
 
,
 
plenty of Serpents hidden in
the sands,
 whereof the 
Israelites
 had sad experience, when
 stung of them
in their passage. 
Solinus
 calls them 
pennatos Serpentes, winged Serpents,
 affir∣ming
their poison so active, 
ut morsum antè mors quàm dolor insequatur,
 that

death ensues their biting, before any pain felt thereby.
 Say not, that a flying-ser∣pent
is a contradiction, scarce reconcileable with Gods curse on that
creature,
 
upon the belly shalt thou goe,
 seeing in the Leviticall law we finde
the 
Iews
 forbidden to eate
 
all flying-creeping things.
 And though such
Serpents might for a spurt, in a frisk or frolick, make use of their wings,
yet creeping was their certain aud constant travelling, which they trusted
unto.


§ 3. One may admire, to what purpose,
 nature making nothing in
vaine, intended this wild desert, the ground whereof for the generality,
is like salt when it hath lost its savour,
 
which thenceforth is good for nothing.

Except any will say, it was meerly made to be a foile to the transcen∣dent


fruitfulness of 
Iudea,
 and 
Egypt
 on both sides thereof. But, we must
know, that though barren for the main, and distempered with sterility,
yet it had some 
fertile intervalls,
 especially in the skirts, and purlews
thereof, as about Mount 
Horeb,
 where some tolerable herbage, where∣on

 
Moses
 pastured his flock. Yea, some nations, 
Amalekites, Midianites,
Gessurites
 (whose hardy bodies, and fierce souls were fitted for so hun∣gry
and course a countrey) had their habitation in the confines of this
wilderness. But, the main end for which this desert may seem ordain∣ed,
was, that therein God and the 
Israelites
 might for forty years mutually
prove one another. And upon triall, they appeared a peevish, froward,
stubborn people; He, for a long time, patient, long-suffering, slow to
wrath; but at last, sure, and severe in punishing such, as had provoked
his patience, into unquenchable anger.


§ 4. Here some will demand,
 How was it possible, that the 
Israelites

should busie themselves fourty years in passing this wilderness? Had
the Patriarchs, when twice sent to fetch food out of 
Egypt
 into 
Canaan,
 staid
a quarter so long, in crossing this desert, certainly (without other help)
their Father 
Iacob,
 and his family had been famished. An English Gen∣tleman,
some forty years since, departed from 
Cairo
 in the heart of 
Egypt
 
March the fourth,
 mounted on a Camell in the company of the Carvan,
refreshed himself with
 two days rest in his journey, and came safely to

Gaza
 on the entrance of the land of 
Canaan,
 by
 seven a clock on the se∣venteenth
day of the same moneth.


§ 5. It is answered;
 first, the 
Israelites
 went not the
 
nearest way
through the land of the Philistines,
 over the narrow neck of the desert, but
more southward, over the belly or gulfe thereof, where it was of grea∣test
extent. Secondly, their removealls and stations were not arbitrary,
at their own disposall, when, how far, and whither they pleased; but
were ordered by Gods appointment, and the 
pillar
 ushering them; pro∣bably,
staying many moneths (not to say years) in the same place.
Thirdly, they removed not foreright, but with many flexures and in∣dentings,
that their tedious travell, in the indirect motions thereof,
might minde them of their sins, which caused their sufferings.


§ 6. They were 
a crooked
 
generation,
 lost in the laborious labyrinths
of their own fancies, who made not their 
paths straight
 in Gods service,
but 
bent to
 
backsliding
 they did
 
erre in their hearts,
 contrary to God, all

men, and themselves. They would, and would not, and would again;
now sick to stay, now wild to goe on, now mad to return. God there∣fore
fitted their perverse wills with winding ways, so that no Hare,
when hardly put to it by the hounds, and 
running foile,
 makes moe doub∣lings
and redoublings, then they fetcht compass, circuits, turns, and re∣turns
in this their intricate peregrination.


§ 7. The Turkes (who themselves use to sit still on the ground)
wondred at our English men,
 to see them walk up and down, some


few turns in a Cloister. 
If your way
 (said they)
 
lieth to the upper end, why
come yee downwards? if at the nether end, why goe yee back again?
 But with how,
much admiration would they have beheld the 
Israelites,
 passing from

Egypt
 to 
Canaan?
 now going full forward, then moving retrograde;
now advancing in a streight line, then retraiting in the same. Yea
surely, any man would have concluded them not well in their wits,
untill satisfied in the true cause thereof; namely, that God in this their
fourty years wandring, meant to weare out the whole stock of that
faithless generation, 
Caleb
 and 
Ioshua
 onely excepted.


§ 8. See what fourty years can doe,
 lay six hundred
 thousand men
in their graves, and substitute a new generation in their room. It is ob∣served
of Lightning, that sometimes it melteth the sword, and yet brui∣seth
not the scabbard: and the reason commonly rendered, is, because
the steel maketh opposition against it. Thus God miraculously pre∣served
their clothes, and consumed their flesh; their shooes
 waxed
not old, but their feet did; their cases were spared, and persons spilled,
because God therein met with so much resistance against his com∣mands.
Thus the stock of that generation being wholly wasted, no de∣crepit,
or decaied; no impotent, or infirme person entered the promi∣sed
land, but all able and active, in the prime of their strength, fit to
fight, to the greater terrour of their enemies. And in a mysticall sense this
was to shew, that not the old man born 
in the house of bondage,
 but onely
the new regenerate creature shall enter the heavenly 
Canaan.


§ 9. Come we now to describe the 
Israelites
 through this wilder∣ness;

and first of their passage over the Red-sea, when pursued by the

Egyptians.
 Then were they reduced to great extremity. Fight they durst
not, being a multitude of undisciplin'd people, of all ages and sexes, a∣gainst
a regulated army of their enemies; fly they could not, having the
sea before, the 
Egyptians
 behinde, steep
 and unpassable hills on either
side of them. It was well there was nothing above, betwixt them and
heaven, to hinder the access of 
Moses
 his prayers to God in their behalf.
However, for the present, God so ordered it, that the 
Egyptians
 overtook
not the camp of 
Israel,
 being parted with the 
pillar of the cloud,
 the first and
perfect pattern of a 
dark-lantern; dark
 indeed to the 
Egyptians,
 but a 
lan∣tern

to the 
Israelites.
 Then 
Moses,
 by order from heaven, gave the signall
with his rod, a strong
 east-winde blew, and the sea miraculously re∣traited,
standing on heaps on each side of the 
Israelites,
 whilest they passed
through it. Thus, out of danger came safety, the sea 
flanking
 the 
Israelites

on both sides, whose 
rere
 was secured by the pillar, and 
front
 advanced
far off out of danger.


§ 10. Here the importunate cavill of 
Borphyrius
 presseth for admissi∣on,

alledging, that 
Moses
 taking advantage of a low water, unknown to
the 
Egyptians,
 passed the people over thereat. Utterly unlikely, that he,
being a stranger, should be better acquainted with the secret ebbings of


the Red-sea, then the 
Egyptian
-natives, whose countrey bordered on
the shores thereof, beside many other
 improbabilities. But, malice
must carp at the clearest truth, and had rather lose her small credit in
saying 
non-sense,
 then great revenge in bringing nothing against it.


§ 11. True it is,
 they went over at the wrist of the sleeve of the sea,
and crossed it in the shortest place, God making use, not out of any
need, but his own meer pleasure, of the narrowest cut of the sea, for
their more compendious passage. Thus Christ went into heaven from

 
Mount Olivet,
 taking the advantage of the rising ground for his ascent,
not out of necessity, but state, the Lord of nature therein graciously ac∣cepting
of that service, which she dutifully tendred unto him. And
though small and short the Red-sea in this place, it was big and broad
enough to doe the deed, and drown the 
Egyptians.
 Oh! if the least joint
of the little finger of the sea, be so heavy, how weighty are the loines of
the Ocean if let loose! Able in an instant to press all mankind to the pit
of destruction.


§ 12. The 
Egyptians
 follow the chace of the 
Israelites.
 Strange,
 that
they left not off their pursuit, at so miraculous an accident! Such a road
in the sea, out of the road of nature, seemed not to be gone in, but gazed
at with amazement. But they thought; 
good for one, good for a∣nother;

and all objections to the contrary, are answered in three words,

 
God hardened them.
 Yea, such, whom he designeth for destruction, shall
mistake their funeralls for their nuptialls, and dance as merrily to their
graves as if they went to their wedding. God first sent distraction a∣mongst
them, their cripple chariots turned into carts (when their fore∣wheels
were taken away) halt on very heavily. In vain did the wiser

Egyptians
 perswade a retrait, whilest the returning waters swallow all
up in a moment. Mean time the 
Israelites
 march fair on, and recover
the other side, and then in a double Quire of men
 and women, sing
praises unto God for their miraculous deliverance.


§ 13. But this musick was too good to hold long.
 We meet with
a new ditty, and worse notes soon after. Three days they wander with∣out
water; probably sustained for food, with that unleavened bread,
and other provision they brought with them out of 
Egypt.
 See here
sudden vicissitudes:



1 Water they want. Oh great grief!


2 Water appears plenty at 
Marah.
 Oh great joy!


3 This water proves no water, so bitter it could not be drunk.
Grief again, and murmuring.


3 The water is cured. Great joy again.




This cure 
Moses
 effected, casting, by Gods direction, a
 tree into it.
Thus the infusion of the least piece of Christs cross (I mean a true in∣terest
in his passion) will turn our bitterest afflictions in this world, to
become sweet, and pleasant unto us. From this 
Marah,
 they remove to


their next station at 
Elim,
 famous for
 twelve wells of water, and seven∣ty
Palme-trees: as if nature had purposely produced, a 
Well
 for every

Tribe
 to drink of, a 
Palme-tree
 for every eminent Elder in 
Israel
 to lodge
under.


§ 14. From 
Elim
 they removed,
 and incamped by the
 Red-sea. What
meant their going back again? Was it because 
in their
 hearts they turned
back again into Egypt.
 And therefore God in his justice, would vex their
wearied bodies, to fetch a flexure thitherwards? Or rather, was it be∣cause
God would have them take a second view of that sea, that so their
deliverance thereat, might take the firmer, and deeper impression in
their memories? Thus scholars who have once 
con'd
 their 
lesson
 by heart,
are set again at the weeks end to 
get
 it for their 
part.
 Whatsoever was
the cause, sure I am, they were now no nearer to the end of their race,
then at the first starting, and these their last three removealls were but ci∣phers
towards the account of their journey. Wonder I no longer at
Saint 
Paul,
 and his companions in their sea-voyage, when 
they had sailed

 slowly many days, the winde not suffering them,
 finding these 
Israelites
 in their
land-travell after so long time, moved, not promoted, yea, going back∣ward;
and the slowest snaile makes more speed forth-right, then the
swiftest retrograde Cancer.


§ 15. From the Red-sea they advanced to the wilderness
 of 
Sin.
 For
although the wilderness of 
Paran
 passeth for the genericall name of this
whole desert,
 yet it was subdivided into many petite wildernesses, name∣ly
those of 
Shur, Eham, Sin, Kadesh,
 &c.


§ 16. In the wilderness of 
Sin,
 the 
Israelites
 fell a murmuring for food.
Here over night God gave them
 Quailes, (light supper-meat, and easie
of digestion) being onely 
exceedings,
 or a feast for a meale; and next
morning, their ordinary, or constant fare was delivered out unto them,

Manna
 rained from heaven. Some conceive it so called from 
 in 
Chaldee
What?
 (or rather,
 
who?
) from the question made by them at the first
sight thereof. But, how came the 
Israelites,
 newly come out of 
Egypt,
 to
speake the 
Chaldee

language? 
Egypt
 and 
Babylon
 (the one the house of
bondage, the other the land of captivity) though meeting in mischief
against the children of God, being in time and place far asunder? Rather
in 
Hebrew
 it signifieth a 
portion,
 being their daily allowance, or else
 
food
made ready,
 prepared for them without their labour or industry. It was
no 
fragments of frankincense,
 called 
Manna
 by 
Dioscorides
 and 
Galen,
 no

, or 
honey-dew,
 nor any such mimicall drug (being not food, but
physick) called 
Manna
 at this day by the Apothecaries; but a substance
so solid, that it would endure grinding, and pounding, in Mill and
Mortar; yet so friable, that it melted at the rising of the Sun. It fell six
days, and not on the
 seventh; observed, and inforced by some, for the
antiquity, and morality of the 
Sabbath,
 this happening before the giving
of the fourth Commandement on mount 
Sinai.


§ 17. Dim are their eyes who see not Christ typified therein.
 Given
freely of Gods goodness, without any work or merit of man; in a mi∣raculous
manner, at first unknown what it was, or
 whence it came,
for, 
who
 shall declare his generation?
 Equally belonging to all, rich and
poor, sufficient for all:
 white in colour, so clear 
his
 innocence: plea∣sant
like honey, so sweet are 
his
 benefits,
 
O taste and see that the Lord is good:

beaten, and broken, before eaten; [Christ on the Cross:] given onely
in the wilderness, ceasing as soon as they came into the land of promise;
as Sacraments shall expire when we enjoy the substance in heaven.


§ 18. Hence they removed to
 
Rephidim,
 and there fall a murmur∣ing
for water. 
Moses
 at Gods commandement smites the rock, and wa∣ter

 gushed forth. Saint 
Paul
 addeth, 
and the
 
Rock followed them;
 that is,
by a Metonymie, the water issuing thence trailed after them, in all their
removealls. In what state did the 
Israelites
 march, having a pillar of fire
before to usher, and a 
stream of water
 their train-bearer, behind them?
Both bad masters, but then their good servants. This latter (though
little observed) was one cause of the long lingering of the 
Israelites
 in the
wilderness: the pillar conducting them such by-ways, in levels or declivity
of vales in that mountainous countrey, where the water had a conve∣niency
to be derived after them. How many miles doth the artificiall

new river
 make, betwixt 
Ware
 and 
London,
 finding out flats to expedite
the passage thereof? Indeed, God could as easily have made this 
rock∣water

climbe, and clamber mountains, as lacquey at the heels of the

Israelites;
 (though the one was but 
beside,
 the other quite 
against
 nature) but
he would not causelesly multiply miracle on miracle. How the water
of this rock was afterwards suspended, and another at 
Cadesh
 made suc∣cessour
in the room thereof, shall in due time, God willing, be observed.

Rephidim
 by this ill accident of the peoples murmuring, got (no good,
but) two new names, 
Massah
 and 
Meribah, temptation
 and 
chiding.


§ 19. Here the children of 
Israel
 were in war incountred by the 
A∣malekites,

whose countrey lay hereabouts. A base barren land, yet too
good for the owners thereof, living not so much on their own, as on
incursions into their neighbouring countries. Descended from
 
Timnah,

concubine to 
Eliphaz, Esau's
 eldest son: the dregs of whose malice against

Iacob,
 and his posterity, were setled in this nation. Whilest 
Ioshua
 in the
valley undertook them in a pitched field, 
Moses
 in the mount of 
Horeb

assaulted, and battered the gates of heaven with his importunate prayers.
With the rising or falling of whose hands, rose or fell the courage,
and success of the
 
Israelites;
 till at last supported by 
Aaron
 and 
Hur
 they
procure a finall conquest. This 
Amalek
 was the 
first of the nations

that opposed 
Israel,
 and therefore just it was, that on him (first opening
the matrix of malice) as on 
the eldest son of Satan,
 a curse should be entailed,
and his heires for ever; God enjoining his people a truceless war, to
the utter
 extirpation of the 
Amalekites.


§ 20. Hence forward we never meet an 
Amalekite
 in Scripture,
 but
ever doing mischief. Either stealing; (as when they plundered
 
Ziglag,

carrying away the women and children thereof captive) or lying, as the

 messenger that told the tidings of the manner of 
Saul's
 death; or craftily
plotting murder, as
 
Haman
 designing the destruction of the Jewish
nation; or cruelly performing it, as
 
Agag,
 the barbarous, and bloudy
King of the 
Amalekites.
 Now these 
Amalekites,
 after this their first defeat
by 
Ioshua,
 were never after able alone to wage war with 
Israel,
 but listed
themselves as Auxiliaries, with others. Thus under King
 
Eglon,
 they
joined with 
Moab,
 and 
Ammon;
 united themselves to
 
Sisera
 against

Barak;
 confederated with
 
Midian,
 against 
Gideon;
 and after the death
of 
Tola,
 combined with the 
Sidonians
 against 
Israel:
 These 
Adjectives
 one∣ly
appearing in conjunction, and composition with the enemies of
Gods people. Yea, it is observable, that the 
Israelites
 never ingaged a∣gainst

Amalek
 in set-fight, but constantly came off conquerours, as if the
vigour and virtue of 
Moses
 his upheld hands, and the rod therein, had
continued to all posterity. Thus, besides the victories gotten by 
Ehud,
Barak,
 and 
Gideon; Saul
 smote 
Amalek,
 (when contrary to Gods com∣mand,
he
 spared the King, and choicest spoile thereof;) 
David
 sur∣prised
them and regained his captives; and the Tribe of 
Simeon
 made
a succesfull expedition against them, to 
mount Seir,
 in the days of 
He∣zekiah.


§ 21. We must not forget 
hat mount 
Horeb,
 whereon 
Moses
 did
pray, was the place, nigh which formerly, he fed the flocks of 
Iethro

his father-in-law. It is called in Scripture, 
the
 
mountain of God,
 either
because exceeding high, and by an Hebraisme, all things eminent in
their kind, are given to God, (as the 
Cedars of God,
 that is, very tall and lofty

Cedars
) or, because God there miraculously manifested himself in the

 
bush that burned, and consumed not.
 Some hundred years after, 
Elijah
 living
in a cave of this mountain, heard the Lord passing by, neither in fire,
earth-quake, or wind, but in a
 
still small voice.


§ 22. Whilest the 
Israelites
 abode about 
Rephidim, Iethro Moses
 his fa∣ther-in-law,

Prince of 
Midian,
 a countrey lying south-ward from hence
towards the Red-sea, repaired hither to give his son a visit, and congratu∣late
his good success. During his abode there, he observed how 
Moses

wearied himself with working, and the people with waiting, whilest
all causes arising betwixt
 six hundred thousand men, besides women,
(too frequently fruitfull in contentions) were brought before him to
be decided. He that measureth these peoples litigiousness amongst them∣selves,
by their frowardness to God, will less admire, that 
Samsons
 back
was, then that 
Moses
 his brains were not broken, with so great a burden.
Surely his prudence was not so much tryed with the difficulty, as his
patience with the easiness of many triviall matters brought before him.

Iethro
 fairly chideth him for over-burdening himself. Send us such cor∣diall


woundings of a faithfull friend, and keep us from the wounding
cordials of flattering foes.


§ 23. His chiding is seconded with counselling him.
 Thunder
doth more harm then good, if not bringing some soft rain along with
it. He adviseth 
Moses
 to substitute 
under-governers
 (reserving an appeale
in grand causes to himself) charactered with these cardinall vertues,

 
Men of courage, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousnesse. Moses

followed his advice, new modelling the people, appointing officers

over thousands, and hundreds, and fifties, and tens.
 Parallel to the last was
the originall institution of our English
 
Tything-men
 (a word still in use
in the west-countrey) being a superiour appointed to oversee ten men,
with their families belonging unto them.


§ 24. From 
Rephidim
 (alias 
Massah,
 or 
Meribah) Israel
 advanced to
mount 
Sinai;
 where, after much preparatory state (on purpose to make
terrible impressions on the people) of thunder, smoke, and lightning,
the law at last was delivered. Small hope, that this Law would 
give life,

which at the giving thereof, almost proved mortall to the beholders.
If the Judge be thus terrible, when he but beginneth his 
charge,
 what will
he be, when proceeding to pronounce the 
sentence of condemnation
 on ma∣lefactors?
The mountain was railed about with a 
Noli me tangere,
 the
people being commanded to observe a reverentiall distance.


§ 25. Hard it is to understand, who of the people, when, and how
far, were permitted, or prohibited their approach to this mountain. I
conceive the following modell clearest in it self,
 and most consonant to
the text;



1 
Moses,
 by divine command,
 
set bounds
 round about the borders
of Mount 
Sinai;
 either drawing a line, or casting up a bank of
sand, or cancelling, and railing it with posts: though the last least
probable, trees being so scarce, nothing but hunger and horrour
growing hereabouts.


2 When God came down on mount 
Sinai,
 it was death for man
or beast to approach those bounds (as made on the skirt of the
Mount, which they might not touch) untill solemn leave was
given unto them.


3 
When the
 
Trumpet sounded long
 (as a signall, or watch-word for
that purpose) the people might come up to the mount (namely
up the skirts, and lowest verge thereof, so far as the foresaid
bounds gave them leave) and
 hither they advanced under the
conduct of 
Moses.


4 Here the people kept their station, during the promulgation of
the law: attentive eares being permitted, but prying eyes forbid∣den
them. Yea, on pain of death they were to proceed
 no
farther.


5 
Aaron
 by a 
Call of grace
 (as high Priest in reversion) came up


higher haply to the midst of the mountain.


6 Whilest thus the people stood at the bottome of the mount, in
the 
Chamber of presence; Aaron
 in the midst thereof, as in the 
Privy
Chamber; Moses
 on the mount-top (as in the 
Bed Chamber,
 where∣in
Gods glory rested) conversed with the Divine Majesty.




Forget we not, how 
Ioshua
 was disposed, in some unknown distance
in this Mount, where he remained with 
Moses
 fourty days. As for∣merly

Barons
 eldest sons were admitted into the 
House of Lords,
 not to
vote, but view the passages therein: so 
Ioshua Moses
 his 
heire apparant,
 and
successour designed in Divine intention, had a peculiar favour, more
neerly to behold the transactions on Mount 
Sinai.


§ 26. No doubt the 
Israelites,
 at the giving of the Law, made large
promises to observe it, but very ill performed by them. For, during

Moses
 his absence fourty days in the Mount, they solicited 
Aaron to make
them Gods.
 He to decline the imployment, requires the
 ear-rings (not
out of the cabinets, but) from the eares of their 
wives, sons, and daughters.

Hoping, this his motion would make such a generall mutiny in all
their families, it would finally dash the designe. Especially, seeing
golden ornaments were accounted essentiall in those Eastern parts, and
their heads, and hands being without ear-rings, and bracelets, were e∣steemed
more naked, then ours without hats, and gloves. But 
Aaron

herein missed his marke, finding the 
Iews
 superstition above their pride,
or covetousness, who violently 
brake
 
off
 their ear-rings, even such as
were riveted in their skin with long wearing, so that rather they would
fetch away some flesh, then leave any gold behinde them. Of these
Jewells delivered unto him, 
Aaron
 made a molten
 calfe for them to
worship.


§ 27. And why a Calfe?
 could they finde no fitter resemblance of
God, amongst all the creatures? Why not rather the Lordly Lion, to
shew the soveraignty; vast Elephant; the immensity; subtile Serpent,
the wisdome; long-lived Hart, the eternity; swift Eagle, the ubiquity
of God, rather then the silly senseless calfe, 
that eateth Hay?
 But, the shape
mattered not much, for if God be made like any thing he may be made
like any thing. It being as unlawfull to fashion him an 
Angel,
 as a 
worm,

seeing the Commandement
 forbids as well the likeness of things in

heaven above,
 as in 
earth beneath.
 But, probably a Calfe was preferred be∣fore
other formes, because they had learned it from the 
Egyptians
 wor∣shipping
their oxe 
Apis.
 Thus the 
Israelites
 
borrowed,
 not all 
gold,
 and

silver,
 but some 
dross
 from the 
Egyptians,
 whence they fetcht the idola∣trous
formes of their worship.


§ 28. 
Moses
 descends in haste from the mount,
 and beholding
their impiety, in holy zeale brake the two Tables, wherein the Com∣mandements
were written. Then, boldly he seiseth on their Idol, be∣ing
but one against many thousands. Oh! what an army, innocence


and authority carrieth, in a sole person! None durst rescue their calfe,
and it could not rescue it self; yea, could not so much as low, being
now led to be slaughtered. He stamps it to powder, and being now
pulverized, and strawed on the water, 
he
 
made the Israelites to drink thereof.

Say not, this was uncivill, to force men to drink against their will, and
the 
Persians
 in their feasts had more goodness, where
 
none did compell.

For, as a Physitian, he made the people his Patients, take this potion for
their own good. 
Aurum potabile
 (they say) is cordiall, and this draught
would be soveraign for the 
Israelites,
 to teach them, how hereafter they
worshipped that, which went into the draught. For, now, their Gods
made to goe before, are gone behinde them; and, if so minded,
they might meet them next morning in their excrements.


§ 29. The Idol thus abolished,
 the idolatry was not thereby instant∣ly
expiated. The Levites, at Gods summons, and command, with
drawn
 swords, went 
in and out from gate to gate, through the camp,
 and un∣partially
slay every one they meet. Wherein observe, they had no com∣mission
to kill



1 Children, whose judgment was not out of nonage to discern
Idolatry. Besides, God was very tender in preserving the next
generation.


2 Nor women: seeing men alone are mentioned to be slain. And
although 
Levi
 is commended for saying to his mother,
 
I have
not seen her;
 this relates not to their killing of women, but that
they were inexorable, to spare any at their intreaties.


3 Nor men in their tents; How good is it (especially in sad times)
to keep home, and not to be gadding abroad, without great oc∣casion!


4 But onely such, as they met stragling, and strutting in the streets,
whilest the rest within doors, may charitably be conceived, sor∣rowing
for the sin they had committed.




Say not with 
David,
 the sword-devoureth one as well as another.
 For, sure∣ly
Divine providence brought herein the most active offenders to exe∣cution.
And God was so well pleased with this sacrifice of 
Levi's
 offer∣ing,
that hereafter none other Tribe should offer sacrifice unto him.


§ 30. The number of the slain were about
 
three thousand men.
 A
great sum in it self, yet divided amongst six hundred
 thousand, it a∣mounteth
but just to the twentieth part of 
decimation,
 taking but one out
of two hundred, and five out of a thousand. And this was the first mor∣tall
judgement inflicted on the 
Israelites,
 since their coming out of 
Egypt;

for, although formerly they had many times muttered, yet God onely
chid, not kil'd any of them. But, ever after this time, they never mur∣mured,
but it cost some their lives for the same. Thus Divine Justice is
long plucking his arme out of his bosome; but, having once found
the use thereof, never striketh in vain. Yea, ever after God improved


himself to greater numbers, observing generally a gradation in his
judgments, and the 
price of the Market
 rose higher to the latter end thereof.
But 
three thousand
 slain at this time; afterwards 
fourteen
 
thousand and seven
hundred
 upon the rebellion of 
Korah;
 and
 
twenty four thousand
 destroy∣ed
by the plague, about the business of 
Baal-Peor.


§ 31. The modern 
Iews
 are of opinion,
 that all the afflictions which
ever since have, do, or shal befal their nation, are still the just punishments
on them, for this their first act of Idolatry. And the 
Rabbins
 have
 a saying,
that God never inflicts any judgment upon them, but therein is 
an ounce
of his anger on them for their ancestors making the golden
 
Calfe.
 A reverend
friend of mine, conversing at 
Amsterdam
 with a 
Iewish youth
 (very capable
and ingenious for one of that nation) endevoured to make him sensible
of Gods anger upon them, for rejecting and crucifying of Christ; for
which foul fact, he shewed, how the 
Iews
 have lived many hundred
years in miserable banishment. But, the youth would in no wise ac∣knowledge
their sufferings, any effect, or punishment of their murdering
of Christ, but taking his Bible, turned to Gods threatning immediately
after their making of the Calfe, 
Exod. 32. 34. Nevertheless in the day when
I visit, I will visit their sin upon them;
 so interpreting, and applying all the
numerous calamities, which since have befallen them, to relate to no
other cause, then that their first idolatry. Whereas indeed, the arrears of
their idolatry long agoe were satisfied, and this is a new debt of later
date, contracted on themselves by their infidelity.


§ 32. Many moe matters of moment happened during the 
Israelites

abode at mount 
Sinai;
 as instructions delivered to 
Moses,
 for the build∣ing
of the 
Ark,
 by him performed accordingly, (wherof in the next chap∣ter)
the first numbring of the people since their coming out of 
Egypt,

with the giving of the Ceremoniall, and Judiciall law. From mount

Sinai
 they marched by
 
Taberah,
 that is, 
a burning,
 (because there, the fire
of God, till quenched by 
Moses
 his prayer, consumed the hindmost in
the camp, for their murmuring) on to 
Kibroth-Hattaavah.


§ 33. Here the people fell a longingfor meat,
 and loathing
 of 
Manna,

though man could eat no cheaper, Angels no better food. But, oh! thought
they, 
no Manna to variety.
 Always the same in substance, though disguised in
dressing, proved offensive unto them. This makes me suspect the truth,
of what Saint 
Augustine
 out of the 
Rabbins
 reports, that 
Manna
 relished in
every mans mouth, as their fancy affected, so that all flesh, fish, and
fowle were virtually epitomized therein. If so, the 
Iews
 had no
 pretence
to distaste, what tasted as themselves did desire. Except any will say,
they desired to feast their 
eye,
 as well as their 
palat,
 and severall meats, not
diversified in sight, were nauseous unto them. Had not the 
fever
 of their

lust
 put their mouths quite 
out of taste,
 to prefer an 
Egyptian
 Cucumber

before such heavenly repast?


§ 34. Here God gave them flesh with a vengeance,
 sending



Quailes
 now the second time unto them, after a different manner, then
what formerly he had given them at the wilderness of 
Sin.


Then,


1 They
 murmured out of hun∣ger
and necessity, having no∣thing
to eat.


2 Those 
Quales
 lasted but one
 meal.


3. They were safely eaten, and
well digested.


Now, 


1 They murmured out of humour,
and curiosity, because they had
nothing but 
Manna.


2 These 
Quailes
 continued a whole

 moneth.


3 Many 
Israelites
 were slain, whilest
the meat was in their mouths.



The Psalmist addeth, that 
God slew the
 
wealthiest,
 or 
fattest of them:
 the
judgement fell heaviest on men of the primest quality. Which mindeth
me (though barring all uncharitable application) of a strange mortali∣ty
in 
England Anno 1558.
 at the death of Queen 
Mary,
 when a dainty
mouthed disease did rage, which (passing by poor people) fed general∣ly
on
 principall persons, of greatest wealth, and estate. The place
where this execution was done, was called 
Kibroth-Hat-taavah,
 or, 
the grave of lusters.


§ 35.
 Hence they removed to
 
Hazeroth,
 where happned the contest
of
 
Miriam
 and 
Aaron
 against 
Moses,
 because of the 
Ethiopian
 [or 
Cushite

woman] whom he had married. Understand we 
Zipporah
 hereby
(
Moses
 having wife enough of her alone, as appears by her shrewish

 returns) being an 
Ethiopian
 at large, 
Midian
 being part of the 
Asi
tick Cush,

as learned men have cleared beyond opposition. Wherefore we look
on the 
Lady Tarbith,
 as no 
Bride
 of 
Moses,
 but 
Brat
 of 
Iosephus,
 begotten of
his luxurious fancy. True it is, many years since 
Moses
 was married to

Zipporah,
 and yet no wonder, that now they made it new matter for fresh
falling out. For, 
Anger
 can keep an accusation long 
dormant in the deck,
 and

awaken
 it at last, when conceiving it most for its advantage.


§ 36. That 
Miriam
 was most active in this brawle,
 is not onely pro∣bable
from the 
female subject
 thereof, but may certainly be collected from
the first naming of her, [
 
And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses]
 and
the punishment lighting heaviest upon her. For, God making himself
umpire, ended the brawle, cleared 
Moses,
 checked 
Aaron,
 and punished

Miriam
 with seven days leprosie. During which time the Congregation
of 
Israel
 not removing out of regard to her (leprous 
Miriam
 is 
Miriam

still, a good woman for the main; and such, when smarting for their
faults, are not to be cast away, but comforted) respectfully attended her
recovery.


§ 37. Hence they removed to the 
Wilderness of Paran,
 whence spies
were sent to search the land, and whither after forty days they returned,
with medly tydings in their mouths, feeding such as sent them 
with a bit
and a knock;
 great
 
grapes, figs, and pomegranates,
 but withall telling them,
that the rest (whereof these were a sample) must cost bloudy blows,


before they could quietly be gathered. Here we will not defend their
falshoods by a figure pleading a Miosis, when they in respect of the

Anakims,
 were in their own sight as Grashoppers,
 whilest the Cities of the 
Ca∣na
nites

(liers relations like the sea, what they lose in one place, gain in
another) were (by an 
Hyperbole
 bringing both stone and mortar)
 
walled
up to heaven;
 seeing, in down right terms, they with their carnall fear,
flatly belyed both the place, and people therein. Yea, what if their wals
had reached up to heaven? Did not 
Israels help
 come down from thence?
so that the bottome of their comfort, was higher then the battlements of
their enemies buildings. Hereat the people fall a muttering and whilest

Caleb
 and 
Ioshua,
 the onely two 
Tell-troths,
 endevoured to undeceive, and
incourage the people, instead of stilling them, they had been stoned
themselves, if the glorious appearance of God out of the 
Tabernacle
 had
not seasonably
 interposed betwixt their innocence, and the fury of the
multitude.


§ 38. God (as justly he might) took this their affront in high in∣dignity,

especially seeing since their coming out of 
Egypt,
 they had

tempted him now these
 
ten times,
 and this 
decumana tentatio
 as yet the last and
greatest. 
Ten Commandements
 he gave them to observe, and ten temptati∣ons
they already returned him in lieu thereof. Surely God is a just Ac∣countant,
not charging moe faults on their score, then they were guilty
of, but let us reckon up as many murmurings of them as appear in Scri∣pture.
Not to speake of the personall faults of 
Nadab
 and 
Abihu
 offering
with
 
strange fire,
 (conceived drunk at the same time, because immediate∣ly
after, 
wine and strong drink
 are forbidden the Priests when they officiate)
one that
 
blasphemed,
 another 
gathering
 
sticks on the Sabbath;
 we insist on
more generall and solemn Rebellions, out of the stock of the 
publick
infidelity.

Yet not to stand strictly on 
ten,
 perchance, a 
certain
 is put for an 
uncertain

number (
Thou hast changed my wages
 
ten times,
 that is, very often.) Not
that the 
Iews
 tempted God 
under,
 but rather 
over
 that number, their seve∣rall
impieties not being all expressed, as appears by the charge of the Pro∣phet

Amos, In the
 
wilderness forty years, ô house of Israel, you have born the Taber∣nacle
of Moloch, and Chiun your images &c.
 being guilty of more Idolatry,
then is particularly mentioned by 
Moses.


§ 39. The place whence the 
Spies
 were sent,
 and whither they


returned is called in Scripture by three severall names;



1
 
Rithmah,
 as may be collected from the order of their severall
stations. This we conceive the center of the camp, and punctu∣all
place (otherwise but obscure in it self) where the 
Tabernacle

was pitched.


2
 
Kadesh-barnea,
 whither the out skirts of that numerous Camp,
distant some space, might extend.


3 The 
Wilderness of
 
Paran,
 which though the genericall name to
the whole Desert, is here appropriated to a particular part therof.



Thus in 
Asia
 a fourth part of the world, there is the 
lesser Asia
 (now 
Na∣tolia
)
a large Countrey, and therein
 
proper Asia
 a little Province (which
I may call the 
Asia
 of ASIA in 
ASIA
) as here, this 
proper Paran
 in the
midst of the great Wilderness of the same name.


§ 40. God on their disobedience condemned this whole generation
(
Caleb
 and 
Ioshua
 excepted) to death in the Wilderness, forbidding
them farther approach to the land of 
Canaan,
 and enjoining their tedious
return toward the 
Red-sea.
 Notwithstanding whose prohibition, some
outlaw'd of his protection, armed onely with their own stubborness
(as if with their 
gold and silver,
 they had borrowed also part of 
Pharaohs
hardened heart
) without 
Pillar
 to guide, or 
Arke
 to accompany them, ad∣vanced
forward, and became a
 prey to the 
Canaanites,
 and 
Amalekites.
 And
no wonder, if such who in their 
march
 set their 
faces
 against Gods com∣mand,
be found in their 
retrait
 (or flight rather) turning their 
backs
 to∣wards
their enemies. The rest were remanded by Gods order towards
the south, who from 
Rithmah
 their 
fifteenth,
 to 
Kadesh
 their 
thirty third

station, spent well-nigh 
thirty eight
 years, and were spent by the same,
wherein all that generation was consumed.


§ 41. Which 
term of time
 we may fitly call the 
Gulfe of silence,
 nothing
remarkable being stored thereof in Scripture, save onely the rebellion of

 
Korah, Dathan,
 and 
Abiram,
 and that also without any notation of the
particular place whereon it was acted. Yet
 learned men with some
probability conceive, that
 
Makheloth
 the 
two and twentieth
 stage of the

Israelites,
 was the Theater of so sad a Tragedy, because interpreted 
Assem∣blies

in the 
Hebrew
 tongue, the same word which in the 
Originall
 is used,
when those mutineers are said to
 
gather themselves together against Moses.


§ 42. Come we now to 
Kadesh
 in the wilderness of 
Zin
 their 
thirty
third
 resting place,
 where one may rationally hope to finde much refor∣mation
amongst the people, if all things be seriously considered. For,
such as survived of the 
old generation,
 seeing their equalls in age extinguish∣ed
before their eyes, and this the 
last year
 (in their lease of 
forty
) begun,
should probably prove 
older and wiser,
 learning wit from others woe
not to provoke God. And the succeeding generation were concerned
to carry themselves accordingly, being 
Probationers
 upon their 
good beha∣viour,

to be admitted into 
Canaan,
 coming now to the confines thereof.











§ 45. It is observable,
 that since the 
Israelites
 making of the 
Calfe,
 all
their 
mutterings were mortall,
 and cost many their lives: yet onely here at

Kadesh
 none were slain for their disobedience, save 
Moses
 and 
Aaron
 (emi∣nently
worth thousands of others) who here had the sentence of death
pronounced against them (though reprieved for a time) and rende∣red
uncapable of their entering into 
Canaan,
 as if the rest had fared the
better for their punishment, God not willing that the 
chief Magistrate,
chief Minister
 and 
all the people
 should smart at the same time, for the same
offence.


§ 46. Here we take our farewell of the 
Israelites,
 much admiring at
their constant disobedience, notwithstanding their manifold delive∣rances,
so that miracles grown customary with them, were (like 
Manna
)
contemned for their commonness, and the 
Pillar of
 
fire
 going before
them (
What is ever seen, is never seen
) made no more impression on theirs,
then the rising and setting of the 
glorious Sun,
 doth on our thankfulness.
Yea, still they persisted to rebell against God, and (which is remarkable)

lust was their last tempting of him,
 committing carnall and spirituall
 whore∣dome


with the daughters of 
Moa
,
 whereof formerly in the Des
iption

 of 
Reuben.
 Now the old generation began to 
run drogs,
 (very few of
them being left alive, and therefore strange it is, that any of them should
be wanton in their old age (How ill doth green thoughts sui
 with
gray heads?) though probably some of them having 
one foot in the grave,

had an 
Arme
 in those amorous embraces.


§ 47. But whilest we condemn the 
Iews,
 we see not the stubborn∣ness
in our own hearts. A brain-sick opinion hath possessed many

English
 now adays, that they are descended from 
Iewish
 extraction, and
some pretend to derive their pedegree (but out of what 
Heral
s office
 I
know not) from 
Iewish
 parentage. Here a mysticall truth may be
wrapped up in a literall lye: (
Old-Iury
 is a 
street
 of large extent) and too
much of 
Iewish
 bloud, spirits, marrow; fill, move, fraught; our veins,
nerves, bones;
 
pressing
 God under the weight of our sins, who daily

 
loadeth us with his benefits;
 who, besides other favours, in the day-time of
posperity is a 
pillar of a cloud
 to cool, check, and counsell; in the night of
adversity a 
pillar of fire
 to cheer, comfort, and conduct us, and yet neither
effectually works our serious amendment. Thus leaving the tedious
travels of the 
Iews,
 we come to the ready road betwixt 
Egypt
 and 
Can
an,

which may be gone over in far fewer days, then they spent years in their
passage.


§ 48. Some will say,
 if so short a cut betwixt 
Egypt
 and 
Canaan,
 how
can 
Ioseph
 be excused for lack of filiall affection, in not sending so long
time to his Father, to rectifie his mistake, and to 
untorture
 him from the
apprehension of his sons supposed death? Especially, seeing his Fathers
numerous family on small enquiry might easily be found out, even by
the 
signe
 of his different religion from the rest of the Countrey. All that
can be answered is, 
Ioseph
 had some immediate security, and assurance
from God, that his 
dreams
 in due time should take full effect, and there∣fore
attended whilst providence seasonably ripened the same by his own
means: his obedience to God (whose ways he waited on) stopping
his expression of his love to his parent, which flowed forth at last the
more plentifully, for being so long dammed up before.


§ 49. This compendious passage betwixt 
Egypt
 and 
Canaan,
 leaveth
the 
Mediterranean sea
 on the left hand, as also the 
Syrbon-lake,
 formerly
much larger, now daily decreasing, since the inlet thereof into the sea,
hath been choaked up with the sand. More eastward it passeth by the
Mount 
Casius,
 famous for the buriall of the unfortunate 
Pompey the great

therein, by a poor souldier, untill 
Adrian
 the Emperour afterwards be∣stowed
a fair Monument upon him. But neither this Mountain, nor
any other place on this road is mentioned in Scripture, save two 
Innes

thereon of eminent note.


§ 50. Of these that the ancientest wherein the 
ten sons of their Father
Iacob
 lodged in their going down to 
Egypt.
 I say 
the ten sons of one Father.



And therefore 
the same
 is pertinently alledged by them in their purgation
that they 
were no spies,
 because 
all one mans children,
 (which some resem∣blance
in their countenances [probably] might partly evidence) it be∣ing
utterly unlikely, that persons sent on so dangerous discoveries should
all be taken out of one family, (to the finall extirpation thereof, if mis∣carrying
in the designe) whereas generally 
Spies,
 (like a 
Party commanded

out of 
severall troops,
 when sent on 
desperate service
) are chosen out of di∣vers
housholds, (with those which 
Moses
 sent to 
search the land,
 one out
of
 every 
Tribe
) that if 
cut off
 in the 
Action,
 the loss may be the lighter
when divided amongst many families. Here those brethren were, in
their return, troubled with too much money, (
wealth
 hath her distracti∣ons
as well as 
want
) the 
silver in their
 
Sacks,
 which they beheld as a bait
laid there to ens
are them, though all came off joyfully at the last.


§ 51. The other 
Inne
 (on or near this 
road
) was that wherein 
Moses

(coming out of 
Midian
 and compassing the 
Red-sea
) lodged with his
wife and children.
 An 
Inne
 which was likely to have proved his
 
long-home,

and 
Moses
 his 
Embassie
 to 
Pharaoh,
 was almost turned there into an

errand
 unto his own grave, yea the 
messenger
 welnigh dispatched before
the 
message,
 God 
seeking to
 
kill him,
 for neglecting the 
circumcising
 of his
sons. Whether because his 
forty years
 living in 
Midian,
 had made him more
remiss in his Religion, or out of a peaceable compliance to purchase the
quiet of his 
wise,
 whose aversness herein appears by her words and
gesture, at the same time here casting her 
sons foreskin
 at his 
feet,
 yet hitting
him 
in the teeth
 there with, 
Surely a bloudy husband art thou to me.


§ 52. Now to take our farewell of this 
Wilderness,
 as barren as it was,
some people, (besides the 
Amalekites
 formerly spoken of) made a shift
to live therein. (No place so dry with sand, or hard with rockes, but,
if well 
cooked with industry,
 it will make 
mans-meat,
 especially for 
hungry-stomachs.
)
As the 
Madianites,
 where 
Iethro
 was Prince in the 
South-west,
 on
the 
Red-sea,
 the
 
Geshurites,
 and 
Gezrites
 in the 
North-east,
 betwixt 
Egypt

and 
Shur,
 and above all, the 
Kenites,
 who at first lived mixed with the

Amalekites.


§ 53. By 
Kenites
 we understand not that antiquated nation,
 whose
lands God promised to
 
Abraham,
 but a people descended from 
Hobab


 or 
Iethro
 the father-in-law to 
Moses,
 some whereof removed out of this

Wilderness,
 and planted themselves near the Tribe
 of 
Napthali,
 others
continued here, and both 
Colonies of them
 alwaies kept good corresponcie
with the 
Israelites. Saul,
 when sent against the 
Amalekites,
 was very civill
to these 
southern Kenites,
 both warning and wishing them seasonably to

 depart at which time I conceive they 
hitched their Habitations;
 a little
more 
Northward,
 and nearer to 
Iuduh.
 These 
Kenites,
 (though 
Gentiles
 and

strangers
) were kinder to 
David,
 then the 
Keilites, (Iews,
 of his own 
Tribe
)
who though engaged to 
David
 for delivering them from their enemies,
yet ungratefully
 intended to betray him to 
Saul.
 Whereas the 
Kenites,



though bound to 
Saul
 for a late favour received from him, yet protected

Davids
 innocence from 
Sauls
 persecution, their 
Cities
 being one of 
Da∣vids
Topicks,
 or place 
where he haunted,
 and whither he sent part of the
spoile he had taken from the 
Amalekites.


§ 54. Here let 
Balaams
 prophecy be well 
heeded,
 when looking on the

Kenites, Strong
 (saith he) 
is thy dwelling place,
 
and thou puttest thy nest
in A ROCK, nevertheless the Kenites shall be wasted, untill
 [or rather
 
whilst]
Ashur shall carry thee away captive.
 By 
Rock,
 (besides the locall position of
their dwelling) we understand, their confederacy and association with
the 
Iews
 in the true Religion, (being accounted 
Proselytes
) and
sharing with them in the same success, as carried away by
the 
Assyrian
 to 
Babylon,
 and returning again when
the rest of the 
Iews
 were restored, seeing we
finde some 
Kenites
 mentioned after the
captivity, and are (as the text intimates)
conceived to be the same with

abstemious Familie
 of
the 
Rechabites.


Here the draught of the 
Tabernacle
 is to be inserted.

GENERALL OBSERVATIONS
ON THE TABERNACLE. CHAP. IV.


§ 1. 
I
N all peaceable times,
 even from the infancy of man∣kinde,
certain places were set apart for Gods pub∣lick
service. Thus the ancient
 
Patriarchs,
 no sooner

pitched down their tents,
 but they 
reared up an Altar
 for
divine worship. Indeed this laudable custome had
been intermitted, discontinued and suspended during the 
Israelites
 af∣fliction
in 
Egypt,
 making hard shift to serve God with 
safety,
 and 
secrecy

in their own houses, when publick places of adoration were prohibited:
as always in time of persecution, any place which hath the properties
of 
Capacity
 and 
Privacy,
 (to 
hold
 and 
hide
 the people assembled therein)
may serve for that purpose. But no sooner were the 
Israelites
 restored
to their liberty (though as yet but in a barren wilderness) but that God
issued out order for the erection of his 
Tabernacle to place his Name,
 and
fix his peoples devotion therein.


§ 2. The materials of this Tabernacle were taken from the 
Egyptians,

when the 
Israelites,
 at their departure,
 
borrowed of them jewels of silver, and
jewels of gold.
 The text saith (according to the old Translation) that they

 
robbed
 the 
Egyptians:
 as indeed to borrow, with an intent never to pay,
is no better then flat felony. But, although this act of the 
Israelites
 was

robbery, quoad effectum,
 leaving the 
Egyptians
 spoiled and naked; yet it was
none, 
quoad reatum,
 having not onely a Commission, but
 Command
from God for the same. And albeit the 
Egyptians
 are in some sense, then
said, to
 
lend
 to the 
Israelites,
 yet in very deed they did but pay back their
due unto them.


§ 3. See what it is to detain the 
wages of the hireling.
 Many a year had
these 
Israelites,
 and their Fathers toiled, and moiled in 
Egypt,
 and had no∣thing
for their pains but their labour. But now, both the 
Principall,
 and
Consideration for their forbearance thereof, was laid them down in a
lump all together▪ Indeed they are said to have builded 
Treasure
 
Cities
 for

Pharaoh;
 whereas in fine 
Pharaoh
 proved but the 
Treasurer
 and 
Storer
 for
them, carefully keeping their money for them, till it amounted to a
mass, for their greater benefit; which, if formerly payed them by in∣considerable
parcels, might possibly have been spent, as fast as received.


§ 4. Amongst the materials offered for the building of the 
Tahernacle,

all Persons presented things proportionable to their own professions
and conditions. The Princes brought
 
Precious stones,
 rich people 
Gold



and 
Silver,
 the middle sort 
fine Linneu and Brass
 (not an ounce of iron be∣ing
used in all the Fabrick) and the meanest 
Goates haire and Badgers skins.

And as men sent their purses, so the women lent their pains, the wise
hearted amongst them,
 
spinning with their hands, blue, soarlet, and fine linnen

for the 
Tabernacle.


§ 5. Behold here,
 how all advanced Gods work, yet every one con∣tinued
in his own vocation. Blame worthy their 
Pride,
 who 
will be no∣thing,

if they may not 
all be Bezaleels
 at the building of the 
Tabernacle.


 
How shall they preach except they be sent? De jure:
 How can they preach
lawfully and comfortably? though 
de facto,
 they presume to doe it al∣though
but to the small profit of others, and great danger of themselves.


§ 6. But that which most commended the offering of the 
Isr
elites
 in
the sight of God, was their readiness and willingness therein. None
were rated, or taxed to this work, but all flowed freely from them. This
purified poor peoples 
Brass
 into 
refined gold,
 and changed their 
Goats-hair

into 
silk,
 in Gods acceptance thereof. Otherwise, many may be the 
Item's

in mens 
Account,
 and yet all of them amount to just nothing in divine
acceptation, onely for the want of a good 
Imprimis. For if there be FIRST
a
 
willing minde, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not that he hath
not.


§ 7. One main motive which made them more bountifull,
 was to
expiate the late guilt that they had contracted by making 
the Calfe;
 when
off went the
 ear-rings of the women and their children, to that Idola∣trous
use. They were therefore engaged to drown that stain with a
more plentifull stream of gifts to Gods service. Thus, the consideration
how prodigall we have formerly been to sin and Satan, ought to make
us hereafter more liberall in the performance of divine duties:
 
For as
yee have yeelded your members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity, unto iniquity:
even so now yeeld your members servants to righteousness, unto holiness.


§ 8. Yea,
 such was the spring-tyde of the 
Israelites
 bounty herein, that
to prevent the danger of a deluge, bounds were set thereunto, 
Hither
shalt thou come and no further: They brought
 
much more then enough, for the
s
rvice of the work which the Lord had commanded to make.
 Insomuch that 
Moses

issued out a
 Proclamation of restraint, that no more should be brought
to that purpose. Oh the shame! that peoples liberality under the 
Law

should need a 
bridle,
 which needs a 
spur
 under the 
Gospell!


§ 9. Here we may take notice of the 
,
 and contented minde
of 
Moses.
 Had he been posses
ed with the humour of the
 
Horse-leach,
Give, give;
 yea, had he been but pleased to have been the Cistern whilest
the 
children of Israel
 were glad to be the fountain, what a mass of money
might he have advanced for himselfe, and yet have unsuspectedly char∣ged
all on the account of the 
Tabernacle?
 How might he have feasted
his family and friends with the full 
baskets
 of the 
fragments
 left of their
liberality? But 
Moses
 was of the same minde, with his 
great-great-grand∣father


Abraham,
 who would not 
take even from a
 
thred to a shoe-latchet, of
what was not his own,
 that none but God might make him rich. And thus
honest hearts will rather 
cut off their hands,
 then 
licke their own fingers,
 for
their private profit, when intrusted onely as Stewards for the publick
good.


§ 10. It may seem strange,
 that these 
Iews,
 who now were so for∣ward
to serve God, should soon after prove so backward in his worship,
and provoke him so often by their manifold infidelities and rebellions
against God. Many of these bountifull contributors to the 
Tabernacle,

being devoid of true grace, and some of this people slain afterwards for
their disobedience. But herein we may consider:



1 That this building was but 
a worldly Sanctuary,
 as the
 
Apostle
 calleth
it. And therefore no wonder, if men, otherwise given to
 
worldly
lusts,
 were liberall thereunto.


2 Carnall men may take a natural delight in outward visible works,
whilest a confluence of vain-glory and hypocrisie may make the
torrent of their bounty the greater.


3 Such outward performances are easie in comparison of that diffi∣cult
and spirituall master-piece, the mortifying of mens inward
corruptions.



Hence came it to pass, that many that brought 
gold
 to the 
Tabernacle,
 pro∣ved
themselves but 
dross
 afterwards, and fell in the conspiracy of
 
Korah
and his company,
 and other their mutinies made against 
Moses.


§ 11. The Platform of this 
Tabernacle
 was by God delivered to 
Moses
in the Mount;
 With a strict charge, to make all things conformable there∣unto.
And he herein so exactly observed his instructions, without the
least deviation from them, that in the two last chapters of 
Exodus,
 where
the erecting of the 
Tabernacle,
 with the Utensils thereof, is described,
these words are twelve severall times solemnly repeated, 
As the
Lord commanded Moses.
 So dangerous it is to introduce any thing as essen∣tiall
to Gods worship, which is not of divine institution.


§ 12. 
Bazaleel
 is appointed Master-workman,
 one of a prosperous
name, whose parents may be presumed pious, comfortably calling their
child (though born in 
Egypt
 under the 
parching heat
 of persecution) in
the 
shadow of the Lord,
 as his name seems to import. This 
Bazaleel
 was 
one
of all crafts,
 skilfull to
 work in 
gold, silver, brass, precious stones, and timber

(whereas amongst us, 
Gravers in gold
 are utterly at a loss to 
work in wood
)

Gold-smith, Lapidary, Carver, Carpenter,
 never 
Apprentice
 to any, yet 
Master

in all 
Handy-crafts
 to work, and 
Head-crafts
 to contrive by divine inspira∣tion.
And there was
 
given with him Aholiab
 of the Tribe of 
Dan
 (as a 
Se∣condary,

inferiour to the former in skill, not to clash with, but submit to
his judgement) so that, as all the 
fine linnen
 used in the 
Tabernacle,
 was
for the more strength thereof
 
twined
 by divine command: so God
also 
twisted
 two curious 
Artizans
 together (besides many other 
wise hearted


men
) that the building might be the more substantially effected.


§ 13. The 
Tabernacle
 taken in generall consisted of two principall
parts:




1 The 
Court of the Tabernacle,
 being an
 
hundred Cubits long,
 and
 
fifty
broad,
 made with hangings and pillars for side-walls, and without
roof, open at top, parallel to the outward Courts of 
Solomons Temple.


2 The 
covered Tabernacle
 (consisting of the 
Holy,
 and 
Holy of Holies
)
answering to the 
, or 
roofed Temple,
 whose length may be col∣lected
to be thirty yards (accounting a Cubit a yard) because
composed of twenty
 boards, 
standing
 
upwards,
 each a
 
Cubit and
an halfe in breadth
 (so that the breadth of the boards joined together
made the length of the 
Tabernacle
) the height thereof being the
length of the boards, that is ten Cubits, and the breadth thereof
of the same proportion.



This latter alone is presented in our Map, as the proper subject of our
description. It was without windows, admitting no naturall light,
(save what entred in on the east at the door when opened) the defect
whereof was supplied with the constant light from the sevenfold 
Golden
Candlestick.


§ 14. To resume the 
boards
 of the 
Tabernacle;
 we have (as formerly)
their 
length,
 and 
breadth,
 but not 
thickness
 expressed in Scripture. 
Arias
Montanus
 conceives them almost a 
Cubit
 thick, but if so, they had rather
been 
trabes quàm asseres, beams
 then 
boards;
 whilest 
Iosephus
 more proba∣bly
conjectures them 
four fingers
 thick, and we may conclude them so
substantiall, as was consistent with their portableness. They were
 
over∣laid
with gold,
 understand it, they were 
gilt over,
 both because, if covered
with 
gold-plate,
 the same was more subject to discomposure at the dis∣jointing
and removing thereof, and because it is impossible such a mass
of the purest metall should be found with exiles in the wilderness. Each
board had two
 
tenons
 fastned in their silver 
sockets,
 which 
sockets
 some
conceive made 
fitchy,
 or 
picked,
 to be put into the earth; which we rather
beleeve 
flat
 and 
firm,
 standing fast on the surface of the ground, otherwise
no need of silver 
sockets
 if their bravery was all buried in the earth. These
boards had bars also (overlaid with 
gold) in the midst of them,
 (understand it
not perforating their thickness, but) running along their breadth in an
even proportion through 
golden rings
 (as in our draught is described) to
make them the more portable.


§ 15. The inside of the 
Tabernacle
 was covered with curious cour∣tains
embroidered with 
Cherubims,
 and a threefold roof (shewing the

 plentifulness of divine protection over the Church against all dangers)
covered the same. One of 
Goats-hair,
 (spun into cloth) another of 
Rams
skins
 died red, and a third of 
Badgers-skins;
 the latter no doubt had the
fur upon them, the lubricity of the haire thereof being excellent 
gutters
and spouts
 to shoot down the rain thereby.


§ 16. But amongst all the materialls in the 
Tabernacle
 none more fre∣quently
mentioned then 
Shittim-wood,
 though learned men agree not,
what it was, or where it grew. But, leaving them to 
abound in their own
sense,
 we will content our selves with three principall properties of this
wood. First, it was very durable, therefore usually translated in the

Greek
 
, wood 
which never rotteth.
 Secondly, it was portable, very
light for carriage, else the 
Israelites
 coming out of 
Egypt,
 would never
have cumbered themselves, to have brought heavy lumber along, seeing
such 
shittim wood
 was not 
felled
 by them in the way, but
 
found with them,
 as
the text doth observe. Lastly, it was precious, used in the middest of the
most Utensils of the 
Tabernacle: Arke,
 and both the 
Altars,
 typifying there
in the 
humanity of Christ;
 in the 
brazen Altar of burnt offering,
 resembling his

satisfaction
 when Redeemer; and in the 
golden Altar of Incense,
 representing
his 
intercession
 as Mediator; retaining still his [glorified] 
body
 about him
in
 heaven.


§ 17. Many will wonder,
 that this
 
Shittim-wood
 in the middest of
the 
Altar
 for sacrifices (though plated over with 
brass
 on each side) was
never fired with the continuall flames thereupon. Some know to their
sorrow how soon such 
rafters
 or 
joices
 are set on fire, which by the ill
contrivance of the 
Carpenter
 run under those 
hearths
 where constant fires
are kept. But we must know, that on the 
Altar
 the fire came down from
heaven, and onely minded the dispatch of that message on which it was
sent; and as gun-powder (though ill comparing 
fire of heaven,
 and
 
fire
of hell
 together) burnes onely upwards: so this celestiall fire, as in mo∣tion,
so in operation, had its activity upwards towards heaven, whence
it derived the descent thereof.


§ 18. Expect not here an 
enumeration
 (much less an 
exposition
) of all the
Utensils of the 
Tabernacle,
 most of them being formerly touched in 
Solo∣mons

Temple. Onely here a word of the 
Laver,
 and 
Aarons
 solemn 
Ponti∣ficalls,

because of their rare composition. The former was made of the

 
looking-glasses
 of the women, many being much troubled herein, how
so brickle matter when broken could be made usefull, and solidated for
this service. Indeed we have a tradition of one at 
Venice,
 who made glass

malleable,
 but was for his invention rewarded with death by the State
(who knew full well that they must break, if 
glasses
 were not broken)
though this is listned unto as a fable. But, to the difficulty in hand, it is
meerly grounded on a mistake, that all 
Specula
 must needs be 
vitrea,
 that
what renders the reflexion of a face cannot be but of 
glasse.
 Whereas
many other 
resplendent,
 though not 
transparent
 bodies, doe the same, as
polished 
touch, jet, steel,
 and 
brass,
 the purest of the last most probably being
here intended. Surely such 
looking-glasses,
 which severally were so clear,
lost not their lustre by being many of them melted into the 
Laver,
 but
(when polished again) retained their returning of resemblances. But,
whether the Priests (as some will have it) made use thereof to disco∣ver


all soiliness in them before they washed, as also after washing, whe∣ther
the same were sufficiently cleansed, we dare not define.


§ 19. However,
 commendable was the devotion of these women in
bringing their 
glasses
 (dear ornaments in their account) to Gods service.
Oh that men would but part with their superfluous, yea noxious 
glasses

(such as might be spared, not onely without any 
hurt,
 but with much

health
 to their souls, bodies, and estates) to bestow them on 
pious uses!

What monuments to Gods glory, and the good of others, might there∣with
be erected?


§ 20. We must not forget the
 eight ornaments of 
Aaron
 thus rec∣koned
up.
 1. 
Linnen breeches
 next his flesh. 2. A 
Coat
 of fine linnen over
them. 3. Girded with an 
embroidered girdle.
 4. Over which coat and
girdle a 
robe all of blew,
 with 
bells
 and 
Pomegranates.
 5. Upon it the 
Ephod,

on the shoulders whereof two goodly 
Berill stones
 graven with the names
of the Tribes of 
Israel.
 6. In the 
Ephod
 the 
Breast-plate,
 and therein the

Urim
 and 
Thummim.
 7. On his head a 
Mitre.
 8. In the forefront whereof
a 
plate of pure gold
 two fingers broad, wherein was graven 
Holiness to the
Lord.
 Say not, that the 
High-priest
 was sweltred, being built 
so many stories
high
 in his garments; seeing, if 
pride be never a cold,
 when pleasing its own
fancy; 
piety can never be too hot,
 with what it weareth in obedience to Gods
commandement. The Priests hands and feet, when entring into the 
Holy
of Holies,
 were washed and bare, to show the purity, simplicity, and sin∣cerity
of his actions, and conversation, especially in the service of God.


§ 21. In the making of these vestments we frequently meet with four
essentiall ingredients,
 
blew, purple, scarlet,
 and 
fine twined linnen.
 Here
 
Ri∣bera

findes the four elements (though hardly put to it to make them all
out) 
fire
 in the colour of 
scarlet; aire
 of 
blew; earth
 in 
fine linnen,
 because it
coming thence; 
water
 in the colour of 
purple,
 because died with the li∣quour
of a fish from the sea: as if the High-priest was thus presented as

upreme Chaplain to the 
Lord of the Universe.
 Thus though taking in the
whole world, in my minde he leaves out the most materiall mystery in∣tended
therein; for, we may behold the High-priest, when entering the

Holy of Holies,
 representing Christ himself under such coloured clothes
in a double capacity; First, as he stood charged with the guilt of man∣kinde,
when 
The Lord
 
laid on him the iniquity of us all,
 having our
 
scarlet

and 
crimson
 sins imputed unto him. Secondly, as he made satisfaction for
the same with his bloud, 
scarlet, blew,
 and 
purple
 being severall 
sanguine

colours, differing onely in 
degrees,
 and the severall 
setlings
 thereof.


§ 22. What 
Urim
 and 
Thummim
 were (
 in the 
Se∣ptuagint,


 in 
Aquila, doctrina & veritas
 in the Vulgar, 
light

and 
perfection,
 according to the interpretation of the 
Hebrew
) neither 
Iew

nor 
Christian
 can tell; though the former (the blinder the bolder) are as
various, as confident in their conjectures. Some conceive it those very

two words,
 others the name 
Iehovah
 graven in the 
breast-plate,
 others nothing


else but the twelve stones, resplendent with 
light
 and compleated to 
per∣fection

with the Tribes names therein, and other some mysterious mat∣ter,
not of mans making but Gods giving to 
Moses.
 In a word, we shall
never certainly know what 
Urim,
 and 
Thummim
 were, untill (as in the
case of
 
Braz
lla
's
 children) there 
stand up a Priest with Urim and Thummim

to inform us thereof.


§ 23. Nor less is the variance amongst authours, how answers there∣by
were returned to the Priests that consulted it, in behalfe of others, whe∣ther
such designes should be undertaken, or not. Some conceive, that at
such times, the fair, fresh, and orient lustre of the stones therein amoun∣
ed
to the 
a
irmative,
 whilest their dim, dull, and dead colour was inter∣preted

negative.
 Others conceive, that seeing the Tribes names therein
contained all the 
Hebrew
 letters and vowels, such characters discovered
themselves by their sparkling, which concurred to the spelling of a 
grant

or 
deniall,
 as here (imitating the 
Hebrew
 in our 
English
 tongue) is descri∣bed.
Conceive such letters as we here make 
Capita
 appearing extraordi∣narily
radiant on the Priests enquiry. And also to avoid confusion, that
sparkling first in time, which was to be read first in place.

But leaving these difficult trifles (beneath the state of the high-priest, good
onely for 
Acrostick-mongers,
 and 
Anagrammatists
 to pore upon) I conceive
rather, that (because sometimes the answer returned was prolix and en∣cumbered
with numerous and important
 circumstances, troublesome
to be represented in such 
literal curiosities
) it was neither audible to the ear,
nor legible to the eye, but by
 illuminating the understanding of the
High-priest, inabling him to give a satisfactory answer in all particulars,
to the question propounded, whilest consulting the 
Urim
 and 
Thummim

as of divine institution, to invite the Spirit of God upon him.


§ 24. There needs no other argument to be alledged for the freeness,

and forwardness of the 
Israelites
 in building the 
Tabernacle,
 then that the
same was fully finished in few moneths. For they came to the desert of

Sinai
 in the 
third
 
moneth
 after their coming out of 
Egypt,
 and all was ended
before the
 
twentieth day
 of the 
second moneth
 of the 
second year,
 when they
removed from 
Sinai
 to the 
Wilderness of Paran.
 So that not above eleven
moneths were expended on the whole fabrick, whereas 
Solomon
 in buil∣ding
the Temple (though confessed a far more stable, and stately
structure) spend full
 
seven years
 therein.


§ 25. The 
Tabernacle
 thus finished, most methodicall was the march∣ing
and pitching of the Tribes about it; and surely, that God who in his


service enjoined order under the 
Law,
 will not allow confusion under
the 
Gospell.






See we here the 
Le∣vites

of 
Kohath,
 and the

Reubenites,
 near neigh∣bours
on the south of
the 
Tabernacle.
 Here∣upon
it came to pass,
that 
Korah
 the grand∣child
of 
Kohath
 the 
Le∣vite,

conspired against

Moses
 with 
Dathan
 and

Abiram
 the sons of

 
Reuben,
 the vicinity of
their habitation affording them the conveniency of intercourse, and pri∣vacy
together. And thus was the 
Tabernacle
 first put in its posture, sur∣rounded
with the people on every side. Happy method, when in mat∣ters
of religion the Church guides the State by her counsell, whilest
the State guards the Church with her company.


§ 26. This 
Tabernacle
 when first brought into the land of 
Canaan,
 was
set up at 
Gilgat,
 (the 
Ark
 being often parted from it on severall occasions)
thence removed to 
Shiloh
 where it staid a long time, thence to
 
Nob,
 thence
to 
ib
on,
 and thence brought into 
Ierusalem,
 and laid up with the vessels
thereof in the
 
Temple.
 The 
Rabbins
 conceive that during the abode there∣of
at 
Shiloh,
 the 
Tabernacle
 began to 
Templize,
 getting wals (though with∣out
a roof) round about it, chiefly because about that time it is
 
thrice

termed a 
Temple.
 But I rather conceive, that 
Temple
 in those places is taken
in a large acception, in which notion
 
Iosephus
 termeth it 
,
an 
ambulatory,
 or 
portable
 Temple. Or else it is so styled
by way of Prolepsis, and well might 
David (twice
 in the forementioned
places) call the 
Tabernacle
 a 
Temple,
 who endevored to make it so, both in
his 
intention,
 and vast 
preparation
 for the same. But enough of this subject, for
as 
Moses
 by his
 prohibition stopped the bounty of the people bringing
too much to the making of the 
Tabernacle:
 so must we here stint our dis∣course
as swelling too large in the description thereof. Onely I adde, that
though at the first 
free will-offerings
 alone were used, at the making of the

Tabernacle,
 (none being necessitated to contribute thereunto) yet after∣wards
for the maintenance thereof, and the service therein, men were
bound to a certain sum to be paid
 
thrice a year.
 God foreseeing that their
first forwardness would not always continue, but cool by degrees, and
need to be quickned by commands, as men now adays must be legally
rated to repair those Churches which at first so franckly were erected,
and endowed by the liberality and devotion of our Ancestors.


Here the Map of 
Egypt
 is to be inserted.


















THE
DESCRIPTION
OF
EGYPT. CHAP. V.


§ 1.
E
GYPT was by the 
Hebrews
 called 
Mizraim
 (and
by the 
Arabians,
 
Mesre,
 at this day) from
 
Miz∣raim

the second son of 
Cham,
 first inhabitant
thereof. It was anciently called 
, by the
most skilfull of the 
Egyptian
 Priests, as 
Plutarch


 observes, no doubt from 
Cham
 the second
son of Noah: as also it was termed 
Hammois
 (a
name also generall to 
Libya,
 yea to all 
Africk
) being in the same sound
and sense styled the 
Land
 of Ham
 by the Psalmist. It had the Mediter∣ranean
sea on the north, 
Cyrene
 on the west, 
Ethiopia
 (the countrey of Queen

 
Candace
) on the south, the Red-sea on the east, with a smal 
Isthmus
 of land
(not past seventy miles over) betwixt it and the Mediterranean. Many
Princes with as great expence as small success, have oft attempted with
their Pioneers to pierce through this slender neck of ground, so to join the
two seas together, for the greater conveniency of traffick. It seems hea∣ven
blasted their designes, as an incroachment on the divine Preroga∣tive,
it being onely placed in Gods power to give the 
Word of Command
 to
the Ocean, 
Hither shalt thou
 come, but no farther.
 And if it be dishonesty to

 remove Land-markes of mens fixing, how high presumption is it to
alter so ancient and solemn water-bounds of Gods own appointing?


§ 2. The 
Egyptians
 are low in stature,
 of firme and well compacted
bodies, swarthy and tawny complexions. Hereupon 
Abraham
 coming
into 
Egypt
 said to 
Sarah
 his wife, 
Behold NOW, I know that thou art
 a fair
woman to look upon.
 Not that being so many years married, he had hither∣to
lived in ignorance of her beauty, and 
now
 took first notice thereof,
but (as Stars shine brightest in the night) so her fairness was 
now
 more


conspicuous amongst the black faces of the 
Egyptians.
 Their wits anci∣ently
were very subtile and searching, esteemed the first inventers of
Arithmetick, Musick, and by reason of the perpetuall serenity of the
aire, they found out the course of the Sun and Stars, first dividing Time
into Moneths, and Years. 
The wisdome of the
 Egyptians,
 is eminent in
Scripture, much given to Magick, and Divination, yea
 
Iannes
 and 
Iam∣bres

the Inchanters have even to this day some in 
Egypt,
 heires to their
mysterious impieties. As for the wandering Gypsies, which now a
days pretend to the telling of Fortunes, their best cunning generally is the
credulity of others, oft-times not seeing how near their own feet are to
the stocks, and backs to the whipping-post. Yea commonly they are
counterfeites, coming no more from 
Egypt,
 then the dissembling 
Gibeo∣nites

did from a far
 Countrey, and perchance are next neighbours un∣to
us.


§ 3. A most pleasant Countrey 
Egypt
 was,
 and is. For when the holy
Spirit intended to commend the sweet situation of the 
plain of Iordan
 (be∣fore
it was turned for the sins of the people into a stinking lake) he de∣scribeth
it to be 
well watered every where, even as the Garden of the Lord, like
the
 land of Egypt.
 Nor was the profit less then the pleasure thereof, affor∣ding
plenty of the best Wheat, Barly, Rice, and all other grain; insomuch
that this Land was generally 
horreum Romani imperii,
 the Barn or Granary
of the 
Roman
 Empire. Indeed I finde the same title given also to the
Island of 
Sicily.
 And no wonder; for the 
Roman
 Empire being so vast
and expensive an housekeeper, might wel make use of two Barnes for her
provision. However I dare boldly say, that though 
Sicily
 was the nearer,

Egypt
 was the bigger and better Barn, and yeelded greatest store of corn
in time of scarcity.


§ 4. Flax also was a stable commodity of 
Egypt,
 much whereof at this
day is imported and used in 
England.
 Of this the finest linen in the
world was woven. The Harlot could tell the silly young man, she
sought to inveigle, 
I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
works, and fine
 linen of Egypt,
 as commonly the worst of women, get the
best of wares, to please their luxury. As for the making of this linen
cloth, it will hardly be beleeved, what 
Pomponius Mela
 hath reported, that
the ancient 
Egyptians
 used to have their men keep home and spin, while
their women managed their greater businesses abroad. But surely where
the man puts his hand to the spindle, and the woman to the plough, there
the whole family will be ill clad, and worse fed.


§ 5. Horses of the best kind were very plentifull in 
Egypt.
 Those
were a prohibited commodity, forbidden by Gods law to be brought
by great numbers into 
Israel,
 whose King was charged,
 
Not to multiply
horses to himself, nor to cause the people to return into Egypt;
 partly, lest whilest
they went thither to course horses, they should change religions, and
fall into love with 
Egyptian
 Idolatry; partly, lest they should place too


much confidence in the legs of horses; or arme of flesh, whom God
would have immediately to depend on his own protection.


§ 6. Paper most usefull for intercourse, anciently grew in 
Egypt
 alone,

being a sedgy weed on the rivers side, which they divided into thin flakes,
whereinto it naturally parteth, then laying them on a table and moisten∣ing
them with the glutinous water of the River, they pressed them toge∣ther,
and so dried them in the Sun. God foretelling his punishments
on
 
Egypt,
 threatneth that 
The paper reeds of the brooks, by the mouth of the
brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no
more.


§ 7. 
Mummy
 must not be forgotten,
 being mans flesh, at the first em∣balmed
for
 forty days together, and afterward for many years buried,
in that hot and sandy Countrey. Yet all art cannot finally avoid the
curse pronounced on mankind,
 
Dust thou art, and to dust thou must return,

so that if left alone, these corpses of themselves moulder to ashes. O
her∣wise
such cost and curiosity used for their longer preservation, acciden∣tally
occasioneth their speedier destruction; such bodies being taken up
out of their graves, bought and brought into forein Countreys for me∣dicinall
uses. What, is there such a dearth of drugs? such a famine of
Physick in nature, that (as in the
 siege of 
Samaria
) one man must feed
on another? However, whilest some squeamish stomacks make faces
to feed on the dead, perhaps their hard hearts at the same time,
 
Eate up
the living as if they were dead,
 either by fraudulent contracts or forcible
oppressions.


§ 8. But these grand commodities of 
Egypt,
 were also allaied with some
great inconveniencies, many noxious and venimous creatures swarm∣ing
therein. The Prophet
 called it, 
the land from whence come the young and
old Lion, the Viper and the Viper and the fiery-flying Serpent.
 This, though mystically meant
of the Kings of 
Egypt,
 their Lion-like antipathy and cruelty to 
Israel

(styled also 
Serpents
 for their craft; 
flying,
 for the swift marching of their
Armies, winged on horse-backs; 
fiery,
 for the fierceness and heat of their
fury) yet was it also literally true, of plenty of such beasts in 
Egypt,
 where
that moist and hot Countrey was both the pregnant mother to breed,
and tender nurse to feed them in great abundance. Especially in the
western deserts, towards 
Cyrene,
 an hideous, and dismall place: and
therefore the
 Author of the book of 
Tobit,
 fitted it with a meet inhabitant,
banishing thither, and binding there, 
Asmodeus
 the evill spirit, in the ut∣most
parts of 
Egypt.


§ 9. Rain is very rare in this land
 (and that onely in winter) the
windows of heaven here having no casements, and the 
Egyptians
 sup∣plying
the want of rain, by making gutters out of the river of 
Nilus
 into
all their grounds and gardens. God therefore in this respect preferreth
the land of 
Canaan
 before this Countrey,
 
For the land
 (saith he) 
whither
thou goest to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came, where


thou sowedst thy seed, and watered it with thy feet; as a garden of Herbs. But the
land whither thou goest to possess it, is a land of mountains and valleys, and drinketh
water of the rain of heaven.
 Surely as it is more honour to receive a boon
immediately from the hand of a Prince, then in an indirect line, from
him, by his servants; so more peculiar was the favour of God to the

Iews,
 and the familiarity of the 
Iews
 with God, having their land watered
from heaven, whilest the 
Egyptians
 looked not upward as men, but
downwards as beasts, on that moisture which constantly procured the
fruitfulness of their Countrey. But this pleased them best: as carnall
souls had rather be at a certainty of plenty from Nature, then at an un∣certainty
thereof, even from the God of Nature himself. However they
are much mistaken, who have confidently reported that it never raineth
in 
Egypt;
 seeing I have been informed the contrary, by a right worship∣full

 Person, and well accomplished traveller, a great Patron and
bountifull promoter of my present studies; an eye-witness of much
and violent rain at 
Grand-Cairo
 in 
Egypt,
 but such as presaged a great mor∣tality,
which ensued not long after.


§ 10. The River of 
Nile
 is the happy Genius of the 
Egyptian
 soil, called
in Scripture 
Nachal Mitzraim,
 or the 
river of Egypt,
 as a most learned
Authour hath
 observed. Yea from this 
Nachal
 he clearly derived the
name of 
Nilus
 with excellent proportion. For





as

Bahal


Bââl


Beel

is deduced.

And to make the matter more plain, 
Pomponius
 
Mela
 reporteth, that the
fountain of 
Nilus
 is called 
Nachul
 by the 
Ethiopians.
 A river wherein na∣ture
hath observed an even tenour of admirableness, so that the birth,
the life, and the death thereof, I mean the fountain, flowing, and fall of
the river, are equally composed of a concatenation of wonders.



1 Fountain. The particular place thereof being never as yet known
certainly. So that (as the
 
Tares
 in the Gospell, were beheld, not
when sown, but when grown) 
Nilus
 appears even at the first in
a full stream and fair chanell.


2 Flowing: which constantly beginneth with the rising Sun on
the seventeenth of 
Iune,
 swelling by degrees untill it mount
sometimes twenty four Cubits, and that the uttermost (for an∣ciently
sixteen was the highest it attained unto:) and answerable
to the increase of this river is the plenty of scarcity of the follow∣ing
year. Nor doth this overflowing of 
Nile,
 give onely wealth,
but also health to 
Egypt.
 For if five hundred chance to dye in a
day in 
Cairo
 of the plague (a
 mortality not rare in so populous
a place, where the sound keep company with the sick, holding
death fatall, and to avoid it irreligion) not one doth die the day
following.


3 Fall. For at the influx thereof into the sea, the fresh water keeps


together, and contrary to other rivers, changeth the colour of the
salt▪ far
 farther into the sea then the shore from thence can be
discerned.



Nor less wonderfull are the creatures in and about this river, the bird

Trochilus,
 the 
Ichneumon,
 or 
Rat of Nilus;
 the 
Crocodiles
 and 
River-horses,

(though as big as a cow, and proportioned as a
 swine) for all which
we send the Reader for his better information to that modern learned
Philosopher,
 who hath made a just tract thereof. Onely we will adde,
that not moe cures are prescribed for the tooth-ach, then causes by seve∣rall
Authors assigned for the flowing of 
Nilus,
 nor are the one farther
from giving the body ease, then the other the minde satisfaction.


§ 11. With the flowing of the River,
 rose also the Pride of the 
Egypti∣ans,

exceeding all bounds and banks of modesty and moderation, defy∣ing
Nature it self, because (as 
Isocrates
 saith) they had both drought and
moisture in their own dispositions. And such their land is described by
the
 Poet:

Terra suis contenta bonis; non indiga mercis,


Aut Iovis, in solo tanta est fiducia Nilo.


A land content with home-bred ware,


For forein wealth she doth not care,


Or whether heavens do frown or smile,


Her confidence is all in Nile.

Yea so impudent is the 
Egyptian
 arrogance herein, that whereas 
Nilus

makes 
Egypt
 and God made both, they falsly boast
 once and
 again in
the Prophet, 
My river is mine own, and I have made it for my self;
 whereupon
God to clear his own property and right to the creature, threatneth to
shew his judgements on that river,
 
from the tower of Syen even unto the bor∣der
of Ethiopia.


§ 12. 
Nilus
 venteth it self into the Mediterranean sea, with seven
mouths, nothing being more famous in humane poetry and prose then
this septemfluous river. The holy spirit takes notice of the same num∣ber,
threatning utterly to destroy the 
tongue of the Ethiopian Sea, when with
his mighty wind he shall shake his hands over the river, and shall smite it in the seven
streams, and make men go over dry-shod:
 which words admit of severall in∣terpretations.



1 The strength of 
Egypt
 is hereby mystically meant, whose king∣dome
was afterwards destroyed, and the Countrey thereof con∣quered
and subdued to the Persian Monarchy.


2 It probably was literally performed, when 
Nilus
 by ominous ac∣cident
failed to overflow (as in the tenth and eleventh year of

Cleopatra
) and his streams became low, and shallow thereupon.


3. The ancient and originall chanels thereof are now in time ob∣structed,
new conveyances succeeding in their place.



An alteration elsewhere obvious. In the Isle of 
Elie (Englands Egypt
 for
the flatness, moistness, and fruitfulness thereof) how are the old, and
once plentifull streams of
 
Nyne
 and 
Welland
 impoverished, by artificiall
derivations thereof, into the 
Leam,
 the old and new 
Podick,
 and other by∣ditches;


made, to drive mills, to drain meadows; fence fields, bear boats,
and other private conveniences? Rivers having as little certainty to
possess their proper chanels, as men their houses, ancient families being
daily outed by other of later extraction.


§ 13. However,
 though the seven streams of 
Nilus
 pass current in
most mouths, yet they are reckoned up, both over and under that num∣ber,
by authours of excellent credit.



Ortelius
 and 
Maginus,
 in their Maps of 
Egypt,
 make them eleven.


Hondius
 in his Map of 
Europe
 (where 
Nilus
 is brought in by the by) ten.


Ptolemy
 this Countreyman, in his description thereof, nine.


The foresaid 
Hondius,
 in his Map of 
Africa,
 eight.


Herodotus
 (with whom the
 Scripture agreeth) seven.


Gulielmus Tyrius,
 and 
Bellonius,
 four.


M
r
.
 
Sandys,
 but two navigable branches extant in our age.



This various reckoning, exceeding seven, ariseth, because anciently, some
onely counted the grand and solemn 
ostiaries
 of 
Nilus
 (and these, which
they be at this day, let such enquire which are of the 
Commission of Sewers

amongst the 
Egyptians
) whiles others cast all his 
chanelets
 (rather 
cuts

then 
courses
) into the number. Since, they fall short, either choaked
up, or commixed, yet still maintain in mens talk the reputation of 
seven.

For, when a naturall, or noted number is once up in the market, small
occasionall variations thereof, more or less, can never beat it down in
common discourse. Thus, 
Thomas
 is termed 
one of the
 twelve,
 when
there were but eleven, after the self-execution of 
Iudas,
 and before the
election of 
Matthias.
 In a word, the chanels of 
Nilus,
 daily decreased in
number, because (as pinked or slashed clothes have the fewer holes
the longer they are worn) so his streams fret one into another;
especially, the ground being so soft and tender which lyeth betwixt
them.


§ 14. To come now to the particular description of 
Egypt;
 
Nilus

flowing out of 
Ethiopia,
 compassed an Island called the 
Isle of
 Dogs;
 but,
why so named, I know as little, as why those rich meadows lying be∣twixt

London
 and 
Black-wall,
 are called after the same name, though bet∣ter
deserving to be termed the 
Isle of Oxen,
 from the fat cattell feeding
therein. But, seeing no mention of this, or the next Island (which 
Nilus

makes) in Scripture, we pass them by, confining our ensuing discourse
to Gods Word alone; save onely, that we will take leave to survey the
Pyramides, because
 
Iosephus
 (though erroneously) conceiveth them
built by the 
Israelites,
 when here living in bondage.


§ 15. They stand not far from the western bank of the river,
 and are
the younger brethren of the Tower of 
Babel,
 built (but with better suc∣cess,
because finished) on the same consideration, by the 
Egyptian
 Kings,
to
 
make them a name.
 Yet, who erected them, Greeks agree ill with them∣selves,
and worse with the 
Arabian
 authours, so that 
Pliny
 gravely ob∣serves


it a just punishment on the vanity of these 
ounders, that they are
forgotten. Indeed, in the Criticisme of credit, the Artisans cunning
might cry halfes in honour, with the Kings cost in this structure; but,
both the one and the other, are equally buried in silence, so that the most
skilfull 
Egyptian
 Antiquary cannot out of these Hieroglyphicks of
pompe and pride, read the name of either. Whilest the poor midwives,
who contrary to 
Pharaohs
 command preserved the Hebrews children,
are to this day remembred by their names, 
Shiphrah
 and 
Puah.
 Thus
memories founded on the rock of vertue, stand firme, and fast; when
they quickly fall, built on the foundered bottome of affected magnifi∣cence.
Indeed, these Pyramides are of stupendious vastness, and may
be termed 
Arts mountains,
 though mole-hills, yea, but warts, if compa∣red
to those which Nature hath produced. So ridiculous is the unequall
contest in point of bulk, betwixt their severall workmanships, that
Natures pismires may be said to exceed Arts elephants.


§ 16. Some to excuse the pride of these builders,
 resolve their design
on a point of policy, onely to busie their people, to prevent in them
laziness and luxury, (the mother of mutinies) knowing, so rich a soile
would invite them to riot, if out of employment. But (whatever was
their principall project) their secundary end intended such structures
for sepulchers, where the builders bodies lay, not interred, but immured,
with all imaginable cost bestowed upon them. For, the 
Egyptians
 fond∣ly
conceived (Reader, pity them, and praise God that thou are better in∣formed)
that the soul even after death, like a gratefull guest, dwelt in the
body so long, as the same was kept swept and garnished, but finally for∣sook
it, and sought out a new body, if once the corpse were either care∣lesly
neglected, or dispightfully abused; and therefore to wooe the soul
to constant residence in their bodies (at least wise to give it no wilfull
distaste, or cause of alienation) they were so prodigiously expensive, both
in imbalming their dead, and erecting stately places for their monu∣ments.


§ 17. The long lasting of these Pyramids,
 is not the least of admira∣tion
belonging unto them. They were born the first, and doe live the
last, of all the 
seven wonders in the world.
 Strange, that in three thousand
years and upwards, no avaritious Prince was found to destroy them,
to make profit of their Marble, and rich materials; no humorous, or
spightfull Prince offered to overthrow them, meerly to get a greater
name for his peevishness in confounding, then their pride in first
founding them; No Zelote-reformer (whilest 
Egypt
 was Christian)
demolished them under the notion of Pagan monuments. But, survi∣ving
such casualties, strange, that after so long continuance, they have
not fallen like Copy-holds, into the hand of the Grand Signeur (as
Lord of the Manor) for want of repairing. Yea, at the present, they are
rather ancient, then ruinous; and, though weather-beaten in their tops,


have lively looks under a gray head, likely to abide these many years in
the same condition, as being too great for any throat to swallow whole,
and too hard for any teeth to bite asunder.


§ 18. We have been the longer hereon, because 
Iosephus,
 as is afore∣said,
makes the 
Israelites,
 when enslaved in 
Egypt,
 against their wills,
the builders of their Pyramids; others conceive them 
Pharaohs
 maga∣zines;
so called, not, 
 from fire, ascending in a narrowing
shape, but 
 from wheat, as used for granaries, or store-houses,
where corn was deposited: both alike improbable, for



1 They afford no concavity of considerable receit for such pur∣pose.


2 Their form (of all least capable) is useless for such intents, all

the spire
 being to loss.


3 The 
Israelites
 built with
 
b
icks,
 whereas these are made of Marble.



But for farther satisfaction of the Reader herein, I refer him to that
learned
 Traveller, who hath made an excellent tract of his own obser∣vations
herein.


§ 19. However,
 here we may take occasion, to mention the miserable
condition of the 
Israelites
 in 
Egypt,
 during which time, woefull their
slavery, if we consider, the



1 Long continuance thereof, two
 hundred and odde years in the

latitude,
 and fourscore (from the birth of 
Moses
) in the 
Paroxysme

of their bondage.


2 Deep misery, insomuch that their lives
 
were made bitter unto them.


3 Broad extent, none exempted, no, not 
Moses
 and 
Aaron; Get you
unto your
 burthens.
 Say not, that the officers of 
Israel,
 who onely
oversaw the rest, had an easie place of it; for, they
 
were beaten,

because others under them did not their impossible taske: as if
what was wanting in the tale of the peoples 
bricks,
 must be
made up in 
blows
 on their backs, who were set to oversee them.



Onely, to give the 
Egyptians
 their due, they gave the 
Israelites
 their belly
full, (as of work, so) of
 food: which proceeded, not so much from their
pity, as their policy; (Cariers are so mercifull to their horses, meat them
well, to prevent their trying) and the plenty of the land, affording at
cheap prices abundance of provisions.


§ 20. Somewhat north of the aforesaid Pyramids,
 on the same side
of 
Nilus,
 stood the great City of 
Memphis,
 anciently the Metropolis of

Egypt,
 where their Kings kept their Courts, and therefore it is probable
here 
Ioseph
 was bought, and beloved by 
Potiphar,
 here afterwards accused
and imprisoned unjustly, favoured by the jailer, advanced by 
Pharaoh,

whose dreams he expounded: in a word, likely it is, that all those emi∣nent
passages, betwixt him, and his brethren, were transacted in this
City. Some hundred years after, the frequent addresses of 
Moses
 and

Aaron
 to another 
Pharaoh,
 in the behalf of the 
Israelites,
 were performed


in the same place; and here, or hereabouts the ten 
Egyptian
 plagues were
first inflicted, in manner and order ensuing.



1 All the water (formerly the merciless executioner of the Jewish
infants) was for seven days turned into bloud,
 whereby the fish
dyed, and the river stank, 
so that the
 Egyptians could not drink of the
water thereof.
 Water, which otherwise in it self, was most sweet and
delicious, witness the answer of 
Pescentius Niger
 unto his mur∣muring
souldiers, 
What? crave you wine, and have Nilus to drink of?

The transubstantiation of this element into bloud, extended over
all the 
streams, rivers, ponds, and pooles in Egypt,
 and the sea onely was
excepted, from whence (or from pits newly
 digged in the
ground) the Magicians might fetch their water, which in imitati∣tion
of 
Moses, quoad similitudinem,
 if not 
veritatem,
 they also turned
into bloud.


2 Frogs, so plentifull that they covered the land, and so presumptu∣ous
they came into 
Pharaohs
 Bed-chamber,
 (though never sworn
his Grooms in ordinary attendance) yea, they crept 
into the very ovens

(as if 
Salamanders
 rather then frogs) and no private place was
priviledged from their unwelcome company. But the Magi∣cians
made the like in show, if not in substance, the Devill much
delighting in their monstrous shape, for we finde in
 Scripture,

Three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the Dragon.


3 Lice, Insects, with so many lineaments in a little compass, that
the eyes of the Magicians could not see, much less imitate
them, so that they were forced to confess it
 
the finger of God.
 But,
whether thus beaten out of distance, they here left off their race of
emulation with 
Moses,
 or still continued it, it is hard to determine.


4 Flies,
 properly waspes, or hornets, armed with stings, wherewith
they tormented the people. Surely, they were more then ordinary
flies, because they brought 
Pharaoh
 to proffer to 
Moses,
 a partiall and
conditionall departure of the people.


5 A generall Murrain, insomuch that
 
all the cattell of Egypt dyed.
 Some
will object, If this was a totall destruction of all the beasts in the
land, how came it to pass, that some afterward were killed by
 the
hail, and after that, in the tenth plague, 
the first-born
 of beasts
 were
destroyed by the Angell? But it is answered, 
All,
 here is taken 
com∣muniter,
non universaliter,
 for the greater, and most considerable num∣ber.
Or else, the 
Egyptians
 in the interim (some distance of time
being betwixt the severall plagues, and a year from the first to the
last) furnished themselves afresh with new supply of cattell from
forein Countreys, which second stock was also afterwards de∣stroyed.
So vain is it, for men to outvie Gods routings, with their
recruitings; his desolations, with their replantations; and no
new store, without a new heart, can hold out against his punish∣ments.


6 Boils, and Blains, so generall that they were on the
 Magicians
themselves (Hell hath no guard against Heavens blows) who
therefore could not stand before 
Moses.
 Let them now not try to
make, but unmake such boils, if they can. But here it is remarka∣ble,
that as the wife
 of 
Potiphar,
 when she had tempted 
Ioseph
 to
uncleanness, cunningly changed her note, and complained on him
for offering violence unto her: so in after-ages, the 
Egyptian
 Au∣thors
slanderously retorted these loathsome diseases on the 
Israelites.

From whose false reports, humane writers both Greek and Latine
(as
 
Appion, Diodorus Siculus, Trogus
 Pompeius
 and 
Tacitus
) have
fetcht their relations, 
how the Iews being shamefully afflicted with scabs
and ulcers, were therefore driven out of Egypt
 (for fear of infecting others)

by the inhabitants thereof.


7 
Thunder, fire and hail,
 consuming all men and beasts abiding in the
field, together with the flax which was bolled, and barly then in

 
are, whilest the wheat was yet under ground: a thing preposte∣rous
in our 
English,
 but methodicall in the 
Egyptian
 harvest.


8 
Grashoppers,
 or locusts, which devoured the reversion of grass and
green herbes, till the verdant earth was sabled, and the surface of
the land was
 darkened with their multitudes.


9 
Positive and palpable darkness
 for three days, not so much from the
suspension of the sun-beams, or detention of the 
Egyptians
 eyes, as
condensation of the aire with thick clouds, probably also
extinguishing all fire, and artificiall lights, as candles goe out in a
damp. The Authour of the book
 of 
Wisdome
 addeth, that the

Egyptians
 during that time, were frighted with terrible sounds,
with sad shapes and apparitions, which is more then the Scripture
affirmeth, though we deny not, but that darkness is the pliable
wax, whereof a guilty fancy may mould to it self any frightfull
impressions. Thus all the land of 
Egypt
 was before-hand hung with
mourning, against the death of her people, and all the 
Egyptians

were for three days imprisoned in their places, not moving thence,
so great was the darkness. Whilest the 
Israelites,
 though in the same
Climate with them, were in effect their Antipodes, it being day
and summer with the one, when night and winter with the other.


10 The first-born
 of man and beast were slain by the destroying
Angell all over 
Egypt.
 Here if any object, that the plague could not
be generall, because probably in so large a Countrey some child∣less
family could not afford a first-born: Saint 
Augustine
 answers,
that God in his providence so ordered, that every house yeelded a
fit object for his justice. And seeing 
Pharaoh
 their Soveraign was
raised on set purpose for God to ruine, no absurdity to conceive,
that his subjects were made fruitfull on design, that they might be
deprived of their first-born. However, grant it onely in most


families, never were more heires killed and made in one night.
Yet the younger brethren could not brag of the lands they got by
this accident, fearing for the present, lest their own turn was next,
and many of them (no doubt) found their deaths few days after
in the Red-sea.



Observe in all these the variety of Gods judgements, no one twice used, al∣ways
inflicting fresh punishments. God is said to be 
cloathed
 with strength,

and here like a Prince of such power, he appeared ten severall times in
new suits, so plentifull is his wardrobe, and such the diversity of his
judgements. Indeed, he could have made any one of these miracles,
effectual for his peoples deliverance, but was pleased to make use of them
all, so to prove his peoples patience, manifest his own power, render

Pharaoh
 the more inexcusable.


§ 21. A gradation also appears in his proceedings,
 so that his heaviest
judgements were reserved to the last, shewing first harmeless miracles
(onely to raise wonder and seal his servants Commission) when 
Moses

his rod was turned into a Serpent, and 
vice versa;
 and afterwards sending
Punish∣ments, 


Noisome, 


Frogs about


Lice upon


 men.


Painfull, 


Flies


Bo
ls


within their 


skins


flesh.




Deadly, Murrain, Hail, Grashoppers &c. to


Plants, destroying mans


Meat, in grain.


Drink, in
 Vines.


Clothing, in flax and 
emp.




Beasts, for 


Burden, Camels, Asses.


Food, Oxen, Sheep.




Men 


Some
 refractary folk in the field.


All the 
-born.







In the eight first plagues, God by the mouth of 
Moses,
 gave solemn notice
to 
Pharaoh,
 how, and when he would send them, but in the 
last two
 sur∣prised
him on a sudden. After warning often given, and neglected, ex∣pect
no farther caution, but present confusion.


§ 22. To return to the City of 
Memphis,
 by which name it is but once
called in Scripture, namely 
Hosea 9. 6.
 being otherwise usually termed

Noph
 in 
Holy writ.
 Divers Prophets have reproofs of, and comminati∣ons
against this proud and profane City.



Isaiah 19. 13. The Princes of Noph are deceived.


Ieremy 46. 19. Noph shall be wast, and desolate without an inhabitant.


Ezekiel 30. 13. Noph shall have distresses daily.



Can the walls of that City stand long safe, against which so great bullets
are discharged? These threatnings took slow but sure effect, and at this
day it is justly become a desolation. For, seeing all 
Egypt
 bare an im∣placable
antipathy to the people of 
Israel,
 it may well be presumed, that

Memphis
 the metropolis of the kingdome, as in wealth, so in wicked∣ness
exceeded other Cities.


§ 23. Somewhat north of 
Memphis Nilus
 divideth it self into two
main streams (besides some smaller betwixt them) thereby shaping a
triangular Countrey,
 not unlike a Δ 
Delta
 in the forme thereof. Of these
the more western falleth into the Mediterranean, at the ancient city of 
No,

afterwards called 
Alexandria.
 A place, which principally prided it self in
its populousness (
the
 
multitude of No,
 often mentioned in Scripture) and


in the advantageous situation thereof, both to get, and keep wealth, be∣ing
invironed with water. But the greatness of this City onely made it the
fairer mark for divine justice, which (notwithstanding the watery stati∣on
thereof) needed neither bridge, ford, nor 
erry, at pleasure to waft it
self over into it. How afterwards this City was humbled, take it from
the pen of the Prophet
, who speaking to 
Niniveh
 (though an exceeding
great City
 of three days journey) seems to equalize, if not prefer 
No
 for
bigness above it; 
Art thou better then populous No, that was situate among the
rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall
was from the sea, Ethiopia and Egypt was her strength, and it was Infinite, Put and
Lubim were thy helpers. Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity, her young
men also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for hono∣rable
men, and all her great men were bound in chains.
 It will hardly appear else∣where
in Scripture, that 
Infiniteness
 is attributed to any created greatness,
and here we see what became of it, so that the ruines of 
No
 may have
this Epitaph written upon them, 
Hîc jacet finis infiniti.


§ 24.
 The estern stream of 
Nilus
 from the east receiveth the river

Trajanus,
 on the south side whereof stood the City 
On (Onii
 in 
Ptolemaeus
)
whereof 
Potipherah
 was Prince or Priest, whose daughter 
Asenath
 
Ioseph

took to wife. 
Aven
 is hard by, a City, against which
 
Ezekiel
 prophesied,
and by some is made the same with 
Heliopolis.
 This 
Heliopolis,
 or 
Beth∣shemesh,

is generally conceived the place (though not named in Scripture)
where our Saviour (before he could go, forced to fly
 from the fury of 
He∣rod
)
being a babe abode with his parents. What he did here (besides
sucking of his mothers breast) is not recorded in the Gospell; though

 one presumes to tell us, how the 
Egyptian
 Idols, at his entring into the
land, felt a shaking ague, and fell down in homage to him, as once 
Dagon

to the 
Ark.
 Another relates, how this infant sate under a great tree, which
out of dutifulness bowed down to him, because his short armes could
not reach the branches thereof.
 A third reports of a fountain betwixt

Heliopolis
 and 
Babylon,
 purified to a medicinall virtue, from the foulness
of the Babes clothes washed by his mother therein. All which 
Non credi∣mus,
quia non legimus.
 Thus Authors conceiving it not to stand with the
state of Christ to live obscurely in 
Egypt,
 furnish him with faigned mi∣racles
to make him more illustrious, and therein mark not the main in∣tent
of Divine Providence. For, in this clandestine flight of his Son, God
intended not to present him in a glorious appearance, but to lessen, hum∣ble,
& empty him, so that his poverty in it self considered was a rich mi∣racle,
especially seeing we are stayed by his flight, and brought home by
his banishment. Besides, the
 Scripture expresly termeth his turning of
water into wine at 
Cana
 in 
Galilee,
 the beginning of his miracles.


§ 25. The precise time of Christs residence in 
Egypt
 is not set down,

 but surely his stay here was not so long, as to tanne the Virgin 
Mary,
 and
dye her complexion into a 
Black-more,
 as she is presented in her Chapell


of 
Lauretta.
 I deny not, but the purest beauties are soonest subject to sun∣burning,
but such a face better became Christs Spouse, then his mother,

 
I am black, but comely, ô yee daughters of Ierusalem.
 Nor should I much won∣der
at the colour in her face, if onely the fancy of a libertine Painter, had
not so many learned men made her picture the object of their adoration.
Yet the darkness of her face here, is as avouchable, as the brightness of
her clothes elsewhere, glistering with gold, and rich stuffe (some preten∣ded
reliques whereof at 
Paris,
 the finer they are, the falser they are) better
beseeming her ancient royall extraction, then her husbands present poor
and painfull condition. Yet such gorgeous apparell was not so much
above her means, as such garish attire (wherewith some Painters doe
dress her) was against the modesty of that ever blessed Virgin. But, par∣don
our digression, and we return to o
r matter.


§ 26. Just at the confluence of 
Trajanus
 and 
Nilus,
 stood the once fa∣mous
City of 
Babylon,
 though in antiquity, greatness, and strength, far
inferiour to a City of the same name in 
Chaldea.
 It is not yet decided,
which of these two Saint 
Peter
 intended; when writing, 
The
 
Church which
is at Babylon elected together with you saluteth you, and so doth Marcus my Son.
 Pro∣testant
Divines generally interpret this of the great 
Chaldean Babylon,
 where
moe 
Iews
 dwelt, then in any one place which was without the land of

Palestine,
 and therefore probable that Saint 
Peter,
 being the 
Apostle
 
of the
Circumcision,
 might sometimes reside there, yet seeing 
Marcus
 is mentioned
in the same verse, who is notoriously known to have lived in this land
(and once to have been Patriarch of 
Alexandria
) why might not this our

Egyptian Babylon,
 be here meant by the Apostle? But Popish writers are so
fond to have Saint 
Peter
 at 
Rome,
 that here they will have 
Rome
 mystically
to be termed 
Babylon. Good luck have she with her honour;
 always provided,
that if 
Rome
 will be 
Babylon
 in this Epistle, to gain 
Peters
 presence; she
shall be 
Babylon
 in the 
Revelation,
 on whom those plagues and punish∣ments
are denounced. But, such as plead her heir-apparent to the former,
endevour to cut off the entail, that the latter may not descend upon her.


§ 27. To return to the eastern stream of 
Nilus,
 which runneth through
the 
land of Pathros.
 Into which the remnant of the 
Isra
lites,
 left by the King
of 
Babylon,
 returned under the conduct of 
Iohanan the son of Kareah,
 contra∣ry
to Gods flat
 command by the mouth of 
Ieremiah.
 They took also 
him,

and
 
Baruch
 the scribe (pity to part them, but that the 
mouth
 and 
and

should go together) no doubt against their consents, and brought them
down hither into 
the land of Egypt,
 partly out of policy (though they would
cast away their counsell) to weare their [forced] company to counte∣nance
their design; and part out of despight, that if (according to their
prediction) any evill betided them, they also might be joint-sufferers
therein. Both of them, (nothing appearing to the contrary) dyed here,
not finding their corpes, like
 
Iosephs,
 carried back in a Coffin into their
own countrey. It matters not though our bodies be bestowed in the


earthly 
Egypt,
 so our souls be translated to the heavenly 
Canaan.


§ 28. Many were the prophecies of 
Ieremy
 during his abode in this
land.
 Amongst others, that, when he solemnly denounced the ruine of

Egypt.
 For he was commanded
 
to take stones, and hide them in the clay in the
brick-kill, which is at the entry of Pharaohs 
ouse in Tahpanhes,
 (understand it
some competent distance thence, otherwise such a shop of smoak was
but a bad Preface to a Kings Palace) and did foretell that 
Nebuchadnezzar

King of 
Babylon,
 should in process of time, 
set his throne,
 and 
spread his roy∣all
pavillion
 on those very stones when he should conquer 
Egypt,
 which
no doubt came to pass accordingly. A little more northernly this western
stream of 
Nile
 parts it self into two chanels. One falling into the 
Mediter∣ranean

at 
Zoan,
 a City built
 seven years after 
Hebron
 in the land of 
Cana∣an.

Anciently a chief City in 
Egypt,
 the whole land, by 
Synecdoche,
 being
termed
 
The field of Zoan,
 where many of 
Moses
 his miracles were wrought.

The Princes of Zoan,
 though pretending to much wisedome, are
 twice
pronounced 
fools
 by the Prophet. The other stream of 
Nile
 falleth into
the sea at
 
Sin,
 (where hard-by anciently lived the
 
Sinites,
 one of the ele∣ven
nations of the 
Canaanites
) called also 
Raamses,
 being one of the
 cities
which the 
Israelites
 built for 
Pharaoh,
 (as 
Pithom
 was another) afterwards
called 
Pelusium
 from the muddy situation thereof, and 
Damiata
 at this day.


§ 29. But we hasten to the land of 
Goshen,
 as the best ground in all

Egypt,
 lying in the east part thereof. The bounty of an ancient 
Pharaoh

gave this Countrey to the 
Israelites
 for the goodness thereof, and the poli∣cy
of succeeding 
Pharaohs
 continued it unto them for the situation thereof
being surrounded with 
Egypt
 on all sides save the sea on the east, so that
the 
Israelites
 were wedged in fast, not to depart without leave. Herein
they multiplyed miraculously, though the 
Egyptians
 endevoured their de∣struction.


§ 30. 
Shiphrah
 and 
Puah
 are tampered with,
 of 
Midwives
 to become

Murderers,
 that all the male children of 
Israel
 might be 
still-born.
 The pri∣vacy
of their place might have performed this with the less suspicion, by
but lending a 
Pinch
 to such tender plants, and then putting it on the ac∣count
of casualty, or some sinister accident. But they the 
Ministers
 of life,
refused to be the 
Messengers,
 yea the 
Procurers
 of death: and God, in re∣ward
of their kindness to his people,
 
made them houses.
 Not materiall
houses (as little comfortable in a land where they, and theirs were not
long to live) but understand it, God made their posterity (the 
Midwives
)
themselves being presumed ancient before entring on that profession)
to multiply and increase. Some will say, such 
houses
 could not stand
firme, being built on the foundered foundation of their
 
lying.
 For this
act of these 
Midwives
 was with child with twins,
 
Fides mentis,
 and 
Fallacia
mentientis, the faith of their love, and falseness of their lying,
 and the former onely
was rewarded by God, without any approbation of the other.


§ 31. This taking no effect,
 came out that cruel edict, that all the males


should be drowned, whilest the females were kept alive to be drudges.

In which time
 
Moses was born;
 one of the best of men, in the worst of ages.
He was a beautifull childe,
 not onely in the eyes of his partiall parents
(every bird counting its own young-ones the fairest) but really the marks
of extraordinary comliness appeared in his face. Yea, such was his per∣severing
beauty, (fair in the 
Cradle
 and 
Saddle
 too) that it lasted unto his
old-age; His vigorous and sparkling eyes not being
 dimmed after an
hundred any twenty years. His parents hid him three moneths, and
then not daring longer to keep him, for fear of the Kings searchers for 
for∣bidden
goods
 [male-children] expose him in a
 bulrush Ark unto the water.


§ 32.
 
Pharao
s
 daughter with her feminine 
train-guard
 comes down to
wash her self, spies the Ark, and commands one of her maidens to fetch
it. At the opening thereof, to see with what wares it was fraught, they
finde a child therein, and
 
behold the babe wept.
 It is common for children to
cry (few born without it) whilest this infant did not cry out of curstness,
nor sob out of sullenness, but wept out of sorrow, as silently sensible of
more sadness then he durst express, lest he should give his enemies war∣ning
thereby to destroy him. How early did 
Moses
 begin his meekness,
and learned the lesson of patience betime? The Lady beholding him, had
compassion on him, accounted it pity to drown him, who had almost
drowned himself with his tears. She saves him alive, sends him to his
mother-nurse, pays her wages for suckling him, takes him home when
weaned, counts him her
 
son,
 and gives him breeding accordingly, they
being but half-parents that bestow Nutrition, not education, on their
children.


§ 33. 
Moses
 well becomes his breeding,
 and is
 
learned in all the wisdome
of the Egyptians.
 Yet we finde not that the Court made that impression on
him as on 
Ioseph,
 never swearing 
by the
 
life of Pharaoh.
 However, 
when he
was come to years, he
 
refused to be called the son of Pharaohs daughter.
 Probably
in his minority he owned that royall relation.
 
When he was a child he did
as a child.
 Now come to the full use of his reason, he renounced all such
false extraction. He was so far from writing or styling himself so, that he
would not be 
called the son of Pharaohs daughter.
 It is not enough for us not
to tell lies, but we must not suffer them to be told, if it lie in our power
to forbid it. 
Moses
 is not ashamed of
 
Amram
 and 
Iochebed
 his poor but
pious parents, and will not exchange them, to be supposed the 
son to Pha∣raohs
daughter:
 Though that was not a bare title, but had both the
 
pleasures

and
 
treasures of Egypt
 attending it. An 
Israelite
 in the kilne is better then
an 
Egyptian
 in the Court.


§ 34. He chose rather the afflictions of his brethren,
 and goes out to
see how it fared with them. Finding an 
Egyptian
 wronging an 
Israelite
 he
kils him: shewing therein some signes of that Saviour-ship, which God
intended him for, and he hoped his Countreymen would have
 under∣stood.
But alass, they were capable onely of burning brick, whose eyes


had pored so long on the earth, at last they had almost lost looking up
to heaven with any hope of deliverance. The 
Egyptians
 body
 
is hid in the
sand,
 but his killing was publick in the mouths and discourse of all the

Israelites.


§ 35. This his first essay succeeding so well,
 
Moses
 would adventure
on a second design, to at one two 
Israelites
 at variance. But he found it more
facile to subdue a foe, then reconcile friends fallen out, and easier to be a

Conquerour,
 then 
Peace-maker.
 He that did the wrong demands of him,
who made him a Judge, and whether he
 intended to kill him, as he did
the 
Egyptian.
 I see it is no sufficient proof, because the party is Plaintiffe
that his cause is the best, seeing sometimes they that are most injurious,
are the most querulous. Herein God gave 
Moses
 an 
handsell,
 or 
taste,
 of the
froward nature of the 
Iews,
 (offended with such, as advised them for the
best) that he might know the better, how hereafter to demean himself
towards such waiward dispositions. Hereupon 
Moses,
 by seasonable
flight, provides for his own safety.


§ 36. 
Shall such a man as Moses fly?
 Had he not better have stood to it, and
avouched his act? Sure 
the Princess royall,
 his 
Lady-mother
 could bear him
out for innocent; at the worst, by her Court-interest could procure his
pardon. But he knew it was ill trusting of doubtfull friends in dange∣rous
cases; especially that Ladies affection no doubt abating unto him,
since his refusall of her son-ship. Into the land of 
Madian
 he flies, conti∣nueth
there forty years; that term expired, returns into 
Egypt,
 and
wrought those great wonders in the Court of 
Pharaoh,
 whereof largely
before.


§ 37. But of all the 
Physick
 he gave 
Pharaoh,
 none wrought so effectu∣ally
upon him for the mollifying of his heart, as that last 
Purge,
 when the
eldest son was slain in all families; whereupon the 
Israelites
 are urged to
depart: first borrowing all the
 wealth from their neighbours, who
would make their flying enemies a bridge of gold. Nothing bounded
the 
Egyptians
 giving, but the 
Israelites
 asking: had more been demanded,
more had been delivered unto them. 
Skin for skin, yea all that a man hath,


 
will he give for his life.
 Yet I cannot properly call these, Gifts; but rather Le∣gacies
of the 
Egyptians,
 because bequeathed by them, when all conceived
themselves in a dying condition.


§ 38. Out marched six hundred thousand 
Israelites,
 besides a mixt
multitude; full of wealth, wanting nothing, but
 
leaven
 in their bread,
for lack of time; from 
Rameses
 in the land of 
Goshen
 where they dwelled,
to
 
Succoth:
 thence forward to
 
Ethaim
 in the edge of the wilderness; and
then 
faces-about,
 by Gods command they were to turn and encamp before

Pihahiroth
 between 
Migdoll
 and the sea, over against
 
Baalzephon,
 where
we leave them in a sad condition, 
Pharaoh
 behind them, the sea before
them, having their choice to be drowned or slain; till God sent them a
miraculous deliverance.

Jewish
 habits.


















OF THE
CLOTHES and ORNAMENTS
OF
THE IEWS. CHAP. VI.




SECT. 1. Of Iewish Garments in generall, their matter,
colours, and fashions.


§ 1. 
I
 Conceived my taske finished in describing
the land of 
Palestine,
 when casually casting
mine eye on 
Speeds
 Maps of 
England,
 and
other Countreys, I found their borders,
or margins, garnished with the pictures of
their inhabitants, garmented, and habited
respectively according to their several fashi∣ons.
Wherefore, not to be defective in any
necessary ornament, we have added this discourse of 
Iewish
 Vestments,
confining our selves herein onely to Scripture instructions, and the 
last
Translation,
 to avoid endless difficulties, arising from the various render∣ing
of the names of 
Iewish
 apparell.


§ 2. 
Iewish
 garments were made of severall matters. First,
 of 
pelts,
 or

raw hides,
 all the wardrobe of those pious persecuted people (
Exiles are
living Martyrs
) who
 
wandred about in sheep-skins, and goat-skins.
 Secondly,

Leather,
 as the girdle
 of 
Elijah.
 Thirdly, 
Hair-cloth,
 as the raiment of

Iohn
 
Baptist.
 Fourthly, 
course hemp,
 whereof sackcloth, the generall weeds
of extraordinary
 mourners. Fiftly, 
Fine linen
 very fashionable in those
parts, 
silk, cloth, scarlet,
 
wrought gold,
 whereof severally in due place. In a
word, according to the condition of the wearer, their clothes might be
made of 
any thing,
 but not of 
two things
 together [
woollen
 and 
linen
] as flatly
forbidden by the 
Leviticall
 
Law.
 Because God would have his people
sincere, without any mixture of hypocrisie;
 
, 
all of one sort, linsie-woolsie

being to the touch, what
 
lukewarmn
ss
 to the taste, offensive to
him, who being simple and single in himself, loves integrity in others.



§ 3. Of all colours they most delighted in 
white.
 
Let thy garments be
always
 
white;
 signifying the jollity and mirth of the wearer. A colour
highly valued in Scripture, 
He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in


 
white raiment,
 as the Embleme of victory, purity, cheerfulness, know∣ledge,
and (in a mysticall sense) grace, and glory. Which whiteness of their
apparell, the 
Iews
 daily preserved, with constant washing thereof.


§ 4. 
Black
 is conceived by 
Arias Montanus
 to be the generall wearing
of mourners,
 chiefly grounding it on 
Davids
 words,
 
I bowed down heavily
as one that mourneth for his mother;
 the Hebrew is 
 
Incurvabam atra∣tus,
I bowed down in black.
 However, I conceive this blackness no superin∣duction
of a dark die on 
Davids
 clothes, but rather a dirty hue, or soil
contracted on his white garments, from neglect of washing them
(
Vestes potiùs sordidae quàm; nigrae,
 as we say 
mourning shirts
) it being custo∣mary
for men in sadness, to spare the pains of their laundresses, with

Mephibosheth,
 who, when 
David
 was driven from 
Ierusalem,
 during his
absence, 
washed not his
 
clothes from the day the King departed, untill he came
again in peace.


§ 5. Other mention of 
black
 among the 
Iews,
 I finde none at all, save one∣ly,
that there was a company called 
Chemarims,
 or, 
Black men,
 from 
 to

black
 or 
burn,
 (and 
black
 we generally complain is a 
burnt die
) accounted by
some 
conjurers,
 as trading in the 
black Art,
 & clothed accordingly whose
name God
 threatneth to cut off from 
Ierus
lem.
 They were the idola∣trous
Priests of 
Baal,
 prophesied against by
 
Ho
ea;
 or some appendants to
his service, who were
 destroyed by King 
Iosiah,
 and got their name of

Chemarim
 from black clothes, a peculiar habit (no doubt) to themselves,
and which in opposition to them (I conceive) few other would wear.


§ 6. 
Blew
 succeeds,
 a celestiall, or skie colour; 
Color caeruleus quasi coe∣luleus,

highly priced by the 
Iews,
 who anciently had (as their 
Rabbins

report) the exact skill of dying it to the height, which since they have
lost. Yet I finde no 
Iewish
 apparell wholly made of this colour; where∣of
I conceive this reason, that they abstained from it, as a colour sacred
and mysterious, then which none more used about the Tabernacle, and
Temple, in the curtains, vailes, and vestments thereof. Onely we read,
that ordinary 
Iews,
 by Gods command, were to make that lace, or rib∣band

 of 
blew,
 wherewith their fringes were bound to their clothes. In∣timating,
that heavenly meditations were the best ligament, to continue,
and fasten Gods commandements unto their souls. The 
Babylonians

much delighted in, yea, doted on this magisteriall
 colour: and so also
did the 
Persians,
 as may appear by 
Mordecai,
 who when advanced, was
clothed in
 blew, amongst many other royall accoutrements.


§ 7. A 
gradation in honour
 of three colours remain,
 usuall amongst the

Iews
 in 
robes of State
 for persons of highest qualities, on great solemnities.
First, 
Scarlet
 wherein
 
Saul
 first clothed the daughters of 
Israel,
 not dyed
(as our modern) with 
Madder,
 or with 
Cochenil,
 or with the 
powder in


grain
 [otherwise 
Alchermis
] all inventions of later date; but with 
,
a shrub, whose red berries, or grains, gave an orient tincture to
cloth. 
Second, Crimson
 (to which 
Scarlet
 is brought by a mixture of 
Alume
)
which was used in 
Solomons
 
Temple,
 and in the garments of the prin∣cipall

 
Iews. Third, Purple,
 the richest of all earthly colours, having the
gaudiness of 
red
 (whereof it retains a 
cast
) abated with the gravity of

blew,
 chiefly dyed at 
Tyre,
 and taking the tincture thereof from the liquor
of a shel-fish, formerly found plentifully in the sea thereabouts, but ut∣terly
lost and unknown at this day. And, although I no whit envy the
good huswife described by 
Bathsheba,
 clothed with so
 rich a die, because
earned with her industry (and good reason, 
Win purple and wear purple
)
yet, I confess, I grudge at the rich 
glutton
 in the Gospell, that he should be

clothed with
 
purple and fine linen, and fare sumptuously every day.


§ 8. And now I have dipt my fingers so far in the 
die-fat,
 a word
more to reconcile a seeming difference in the Gospell. For, when our
Saviour had rich robes in derision put on him by the souldiers, what
Saint 
Matthew
 calls a 
Scarlet
 
robe,
 is termed by
 Saint 
Mark,
 and
 Saint

Iohn a purple robe,
 and that without the least prejudice to the truth; for



1 Possibly two severall garments were put on him, as our 
English
Iudges
 have distinct suits of robes, one of 
Scarlet,
 the other of

Purple.


2 The ancient 
Roman
 robes of 
Magistracy
 whatsoever, were called
by the genericall name of
 
Purple.


3 The ground work was 
Scarlet,
 which with a mixture of 
blew

makes the richest 
purple
 (as the most skilfull in that mystery have
informed me) so, being 
Scarlet purpurized,
 it might be termed by
either, and both appellations.



So much for the colours of the 
Iews
 clothes mentioned in the Bible;
other colours, 
yellow,
 
green
 &c. not appearing therein; though I dare
not say, that▪ because these colours not being dyed 
in grain,
 lose much of
their lustre, and gloss in washing (so frequently bestowed on their ap∣parell)
they therefore abstained from the use thereof.


§ 9. As for the shape and making of the 
Iewish
 garments,
 they were
no affecters (
Englishmen
-like) of various fashions; but, according to the
commendable gravity of the ancient 
Germanes,
 kept the same form for
many ages. Indeed their clothes, being for the most part loose vestments,
not exactly fitted to their bodies, but onely cast over, wrapped about, or
girded unto them, the less curiosity was required in their making.
Hence it is, that we finde the 
Philistines
 their
 clothes fitting 
Samsons

friends, and 
Ionathans
 robe given to 
David,
 serving him without any
considerable difference. And, because we meet not with the trade of a

Tailor,
 clean through the Scripture (though frequent mention of 
Weavers,

and 
Full
rs
 therein) it seems anciently no distinct occupation among the

Iews,
 being probable, the men, or their wives made their own clothes;


with 
Dorcas,
 who
 
made coats and garments for the widows, whilest she was with
them.
 Thus the state, and gallantry of the 
Iews,
 consisted not in their
changeable fashions, but in their various 
changes,
 orient colours, costly
matter, curious embroderies of their garments. However so much of
the fashionablenesse of their clothes as is colligible from Scripture, we
come now to describe.






SECT. II. The particular fashion of their apparell.


§ 1. NExt to their skins they ware linen cloth (as most cleanly,
 soft,
and wholesome for that use) and at night lay in the same:
Thus the young man, late at night allarum'd out of his bed, with the
noise made by 
Iudas,
 and his rout, when Christ was apprehended, is
said, to have
 
a linen cloth cast about his naked body
 (as his bed-livery left on
him) which he was fain to forsake, and so to make his escape.


§ 2. Next this they put on their coat,
 which came down to their very
feet, accounted modest, grave, yea, honourable amongst them. Great
therefore the indignity, offered by the King of 
Ammon,
 to 
Davids
 Embassa∣dors,

 
cutting off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks;
 it being a
disgrace to the 
Iews,
 which was all the fashion in the 
cloaks
 of the anci∣ent

Gaules.


Dimidiásque nates Gallica
 palla tegit.

And to prevent the dangling down, and dagling of so long garments,
the 
Iews
 used, when sent on
 an errand, when taking a journey, when
doing any
 office in the house, and when
 eating the Passeover, to gird
up their clothes about them. Hence a 
girdle
 is taken in Scripture for
strength, readiness, and activity, whilest the want thereof denoteth weak∣ness,
looseness, and laziness. Those girdles used generally to be but about
their loins, 
Stand therefore having your loins
 
girt.
 And therefore extraordinary
was that golden girdle of Christ in the vision, and singularly placed about

 
his paps,
 shewing it rather of ornament then use, not to get 
strength,
 but
show the 
state
 of the wearer thereof.


§ 3. Now,
 although free-born people, when about their business,
girt up their coats not above their mid-leg; slaves, for their greater
shame, when carried captive, were forced to tuck their clothes up above
their thighes. Thus the Prophet, foretelling the captivity of 
Babylon,
 calls
to the virgin of 
Sion, make bare the leg,
 
uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers,

as being to wade the nearest way over waters in their passage, whilest
their conquerors would not be at the cost to ferry them over.


§ 4. To return to the 
Iewish
 coats;
 As they were tyed up with 
girdles

in the midst: (
girdles
 serving the 
Iews
 for 
purses
 wherein they carried
their moneys—
,
 
nor brass in your girdles
) so


they were collared about the neck; witness 
Iob
 his expression, that his
disease
 
bound him about as the collar of his coat.
 Either, that his malady in∣separably
clinged unto him, (in which sense we say, 
n ague sticks to ones back
as close as his clothes
) or rather, because he was visited with a noisome disease
and 
aggulatinatus sanie,
 was grown stiffe and hard with the 
purulent matter

of his ulcers. As the 
Iews
 coates were collared above; so they were
skirted, and fringed below, by Gods especiall command.
 
Speak unto the
sons of Israel, and say unto them, that they make unto them a fringe on the skirts of
their clothes throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the
skirt a ribband of blew. And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that yee may see it, and
remember all the commandements of Iehovah, and doe them.
 And
 elsewhere they
are enjoined to 
make fringes upon the four skirts of their garment.


§ 5. A 
fringe
 in Hebrew 
Zizith,
 or 
Tsitsith,
 sometimes also 
Gedilim,
 in
Greek
 
, represented the complication, or conjunction of Gods
commandements among themselves, with their inseparable connexion,
as the threads in those thrummed fringes were woven together. The

blew lace
 tying them to the four skirts, typified how closely Gods law
ought to be applied, and fastned to our hearts. By the rules of the

Rabbins,
 every free-born male-child amongst the 
Iews,
 when knowing
to cloth himself, was bound to wear these 
fringes.
 But women, servants,
and infants were not bound (say
 they) to weare them, though they
might without committing any sin, provided that they used no 
ceremoni∣ous
blessing
 (like men) at their putting them on. The same say, that
blinde
 men were also bound to wear 
fringes,
 for, though they saw
them not themselves, others did behold them. 
Gedilim
 (they say) was
the thrums woven in the cloth, and 
Zizith
 was an addition of threads
tyed with knots thereunto, but the particular and numerous Criticismes
thereof we refer to such as delight in Rabbinicall disquisitions. Onely
adding, that the modern 
Iews
 have wholly left off the formall wearing
of 
fringes,
 alledging this reason thereof, because they have utterly lost
the mystery of making the 
blew ribband
 (even by their own
 confessi∣on)
an essentiall implement of the 
fringes,
 which should be dyed of a

firmament,
 and unfading colour, in lieu whereof, some make shift with a

white
 onely, whilest others (it seems) unable to compleat their fringes
according to Gods command, prefer the totall omission, before the
imperfect observance thereof.


§ 6. Hitherto of the lower coat of the 
Iews,
 which they ware next
their linen shirts. Over this they had another called a 
mantle,
 or 
cloak
 cast
over them, when they went abroad, separable from their garment be∣neath
it. This cloak
 
Iudah
 left with 
Thamar,
 and
 
Ioseph
 with his
mistress, when the one lost and the other preserved his chastity thereby.
Such an upper garment was laid
 aside by Christ, when about to wash
his Disciples feet: and put
 off by the 
Iews,
 when intending to stone
Saint 
Steven;
 and was
 left by Saint 
Paul
 at 
Troas.
 Yea, generally they


ware it not when busie at their work 
in the field,
 and were counselled by
Christ at the invasion of 
Iudea
 by the 
Romans,
 forthwith to make their
escape, and 
not to return back to take
 such 
clothes with them,
 as left at home
behinde them.


§ 7. Of these 
coats
 beneath,
 and 
cloaks
 above, we understand that ex∣pression
in the description of a good
 wife, 
She is not afraid of the snow for
her houshold, for all her houshould are clothed with scarlet,
 or rather (seeing no
good huswifery to aray servants in so rich suits) as the Hebrew word
importeth 
 
with double garments,
 that is, with 
coats
 and 
cloaks
 to make
them winter-proof, and perchance with 
duplicates,
 or two of both kindes,
though successively worne at severall times. So much of both their
garments, not forgetting the counsell Christ gave the 
Iews
 concerning
them (but when and how far to be followed, let others dispute)
 
If
any will sue thee at law, and take away thy coat, let him take thy cloak also.


§ 8. At night they used to strip themselves of both
 when going to
bed:
 
I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on?
 Except in some case of ex∣tremity,
requiring their readiness every instant: 
Nor the men of the guard
which followed me, none of them put off their
 
clothes, saving that every one put them
off for washing.


§ 9. The poorer sort were fain in the night,
 to make use of their 
cloak,

or upper garment, for their blanket, or coverlet. And therefore God by
speciall order provided, that though men might pawn their upper
clothes (as not absolute necessary for their wearing) all the day time,
yet at night such a pledge was not longer to be detained, but should be
restored to him,
 
At the Suns going down, for that is his covering onely, it is the
raiment for his skin, wherein shall he
 
sleep?
 Say not, he was as much subject
to catch cold in the day, as at night for want thereof; for then being
warmed with his work, and in constant motion during his day-labour,
no danger of taking cold, though the same might surprize him lying
still at night, when, how sharp the season happened sometimes, the
high Priests servants will testifie, needing in the spring time
 
a fire of
coales
 to be made for them.






SECT. III. Vestments how varied, according to the age of the wearers.


§ 1. HOwever,
 all 
Iewish
 garments admitted of variations, according
to the ages, professions, conditions, occasions, and sexes of the
wearers. First for the ages, briefly to habit a 
Iew,
 from the 
Cradle
 to the

Coffin,
 we begin with the infant, who with 
Iob,
 coming
 
naked out of his
mothers wombe,
 findes some 
clouts
 provided by the care of his parents, or
providence of his friends, to cover him. Amongst these, most remark∣able
are his
 
swadling clothes,
 wherewith the 
Iewish
 mothers
 swathed


their children. No doubt doing it with more discretion then many

English
 mothers, and nurses, who (as 
Spigelius
 observeth) generally
hurt their babes by binding them too hard about their breast, thereby
causing consumptions, of which disease, he affirmeth, moe die in 
Eng∣land,

then in any other Countrey. And so we leave this 
Iewish
 infant
sucking, or sleeping on the lap of his mother.


§ 2. Afterward in due time he is 
coated,
 with little 
Samuel,
 for whom
his mother made a little
 coat year by year. Nor know I which more
to commend, 
Hanna's
 huswifery in annuall providing, or 
Samuel's
 thrift
in making his coat to serve him a whole year. We conceive childrens
clothes differed from mens, not in 
fashion,
 but in 
degrees,
 which encreased
with the stature of the wearer. Leave we this childe in his calling, name∣ly
playing with his mates 
in the Market
 
place,
 loth to spoil his sport (it
being as pleasant to see children play, as men to work:) Provided, they
be seasonably set to school, for,
 
Train up a child in the way he should goe, and
when he is old he will not depart from it.


§ 3. From a 
child
 he starts up a 
youth,
 and becomes a stripling, then
beginning to delight in brave clothes. If his fathers darling, then per∣chance
he is clothed with a coat, rain-bow like, striped, and streaked, as

Iosephs
 garment, with 
divers
 
colours;
 the sight whereof bred worse co∣lours
in the face of his brethren (
pale envie, red wrath, blew malice, black
hatred
) finding him so far out strip them in their fathers affection. Leave
we this stripling, hunting, shooting, and offering at manlike exercises.


§ 4. Few moe years shoot him up to be marriageable,
 and his parents
provide a wife for him, as 
Abraham
 for 
Isaac, (Abraham,
 who followed

Gods
 
Angel sent before him,
 whilest too many covetous fathers are onely
g
ided by other 
Angels
 in their choice) and soon after he is prepared for
marriage. On his wedding day, how glorious doth he appear coming
out of his chamber as the
 
rising Sun,
 when as a
 
Bridegrom he decketh him∣self
with ornaments?
 We wait on him to his 
Bride-chamber,
 wish him joy,
and depart.


§ 5. Within a year after his marriage
 (for till that time he was pri∣viledged
by the law,
 
not to goe out to war, but to be free at home, and to cheer up
his wife
) he goes forth to fight, souldiery not being so distinct a profession
amongst the 
Iews,
 but that every able man, upon just summons, was
bound to bear armes. Behold we him now in complete armour, accor∣ding
to his quality, made either of steel,
 brass, or
 gold (I m
an for
shields and targets; for, otherwise all the art of man cannotmake an edged
tool of gold, or silver) Defensive; as 
habergeon, brigandine, coats of male,

(which we wish better put on, then 
Ahabs
 was, that no chinkes may be left
betwixt the
 joints thereof) Offensive, & those either to use 
cominùs,
 at 
hand∣push;

or 
stroke, as sword, dagger, spear;
 or 
eminùs, at distance,
 as 
bow, sling, dart,

and other artificiall engines, (whereof King
 
Uzziah
 was the ingenious
inventour) or of a mixed nature, as a 
Iavelin,
 which was a 
spear-dart,



sometimes cast out of their hands, as 
Saul
 at
 
David;
 sometimes kept
in, and thrust through their enemies, in which manner
 
Phinehas
 did
execution on 
Zimri
 and 
Cozbi.
 It is enough barely to name these wea∣pons,
as having no peculiar 
Iudaisme
 in them, but common with other
Countreys. For, though God enjoyned the 
Iews
 some ceremonious ob∣servances
in their wearing-apparell, distinguishing them from other
nations; yet in the fashion of their armes, he suffered them to conform
with the heathen, as might be most for their own safety, and advantage.


§ 6. But amongst all martiall accoutrements,
 we must not forget the
souldiers 
girdle,
 the inseparable companion of military men. Thus
when 
Ionathan
 stript himself, he gave 
David
 his garments 
even to his sword,
and to his bow, and to his
 
girdle:
 understand his gift 
exclusively,
 these three
things not comprehended therein, as being 
unsouldier-like
 to part with
them. 
Ioab
 promised to give him that could kill 
Absalom ten shekels of
silver, and a
 
girdle,
 as a proper military Donative. And perchance, such
a 
Girdle, Balteus militaris,
 bestowed by a Generall in a field after the fight,
amounted to the honour of our modern 
Knighthood,
 not to say, 
Banneret∣ship.

Conquerors used to besmear their girdle with the bloud of those
they overcame (a 
Bend
 or 
Fess gules,
 we know, is an honorable 
Bearing
) in
avowance, and justification of what they had done. And therefore

David
 taxeth 
Ioab,
 that having killed 
Abner,
 and 
Amasa,
 not valiantly in
the field, but treacherously by fraud, 
he shed the bloud of war in peace, and put
the bloud of war upon his
 
girdle, that was about his loines, and in his shooes that
were upon his feet.
 Not that it casually spirted upon them, but that of set
purpose he put it there, misapplying an hostile ceremony of lawfull con∣quest,
to his act of perfidious, and cowardly murder. Leave we now
our souldier thus completely armed in all respects, going forth to fight,
wishing him 
to be valiant for his people, and for the Cities of his God,
 and [for
success] 
the Lord doe what seemeth
 
good in his eies.


§ 7. But if in stead of victory,
 he meeteth with overthrow, and de∣struction,
so that, with 
Iobs
 messenger, he himself hardly escapes to
bring the dolefull tidings of their defeat; behold him in the following
sorrowfull equipage of a 
Mourner.
 With
 baldness on his head (not na∣turall,
but) occasioned by the shaving thereof, to make room for a sad
Peruke of
 
Ashes,
 or
 
earth
 thereupon; 
beard
 
shaved,
 or else, his 
upper
lip
 
covered, clothes rent,
 yea, 
flesh it self cut
 (not wounded by the enemies
sword, but) as a penance imposed upon
 
himself, feet
 
bare,
 and whole
body next the skin 
clothed
 
in sackcloth,
 wherein he used to lie, and accor∣ding
to the occasion, more or less was his humiliation. May he meet
with seasonable comfort, and good counsell, whilest we proceed.


§ 8. Some few years after, 'tis strange to see, how insensibly age hath
surprised him, so that he beginneth now to become an 
Elder.
 If you
finde him not at home in his house, you shall certainly meet him
amongst those of his own rank in the 
gate of the City
 (where a Con∣sistory


Court was daily kept, and he a Judge therein) wrap'd with

Samuel
 warme in his
 mantle, and having in his hand a staffe;



1 Not of any 
infectious infirmity,
 being an heavy curse: 
Let there not
fail from the house of Ioab, one that leaneth on a
 
staffe.


2 Much less of 
Idolatry,
 an hainous sin: 
My people aske counsell at their
stocks, and their
 
staff declareth unto them.


3. But a staffe of 
Antiquity,
 accounted a great blessing: 
Every man with
a
 
staffe in his hand for very age.



To which we wish him another staffe for his better support, even duty∣full
children, and so leave him.


§ 9. At next return we finde him beddred,
 reduced to aged 
Davids

condition, 
though they cover him with clothes he getteth no
 
heat.
 We wish
him (in stead of a young 
Abishag
) good kitchin-Physick, carefull atten∣dance,
and serious meditation on his latter end.






SECT. IV. Their habits how differenced, by their severall
professions, and conditions.


§ 1. PRobable it is,
 that all vocations of people (besides the Priests
and Levites) as Husbandmen, Tradesmen, Citizens, Mer∣chants,
Doctors, Judges &c. were distinguished by their severall ap∣parell,
though we can onely insist upon some few we finde in Scri∣pture.
First, 
Fishermen
 had their coates made with the best advantage, not
to hinder the wearers swimming therein. Thus, 
Peter
 hearing that the
Lord stood on the land,
 
girt his fishers-coate about him (for he was naked)
and did cast himself into the sea.
 Oh that men would but use the wealth of
this world, as Saint 
Peter
 his coate, onely for civility, as a covering in
their passage through the waves of this life, without danger of being
drowned in the Deep, with the weight thereof!


§ 2. 
Shepheards
 succeed,
 sufficiently known by their 
bag,
 and 
staffe,

or
 
hook;
 except any will adde thereunto the
 
dog of their flock,
 as so ne∣cessary
an attendant, they seem naked without him. Their clothes were
made large and loose, easie to be put on, without any adoe, so that they
might 
run,
 and 
ray
 themselves. Hereupon it is prophesied of 
Nebuchad∣nezzar,

that he 
should array himselfe with the land of Egypt, as a shepheard
 
putteth
on his garment,
 that is, quietly, quickly, in an instant, the conquest thereof
should cost him no trouble, as meeting with no considerable opposition.


§ 3. But my pen is soon weary of the worthless wardrobe of such
poor, and painfull people, longing to come to 
Court,
 the center of brave∣ry,
where those 
Men of clothes,
 to whom gallantry is essentiall, have their
continuall residence. 
Such
 (saith our Saviour) 
as weare
 
soft clothing, are
in Kings houses.
 Insomuch that there was a law in the Court of 
Persia,



that, 
None might enter into the Kings gate clothed with
 
sackcloth,
 as a disparage∣ment
to the place. Though the Porters which shut out 
sackcloth,
 could
not stop out 
sorrow
 from entering into the Palace of the mightiest 
Mo∣narch.


§ 4. Courtiers were apparelled often in 
fine
 
linen,
 which the chiefest
of them need not blush to weare, finding 
Angels
 themselves (waiters on
an higher King) 
clothed in pure and
 
white linen.
 Now, although 
Iudea
 had
store of home-growing
 flax, yet she fetched far finer from 
Egypt,
 whence
in 
Solomons
 time 
the Kings Merchants received linen
 
yarn at a price. Kings
Merchants,
 being a 
Guild
 or company of men with a 
badge Royall
 upon
them, probably priviledged with a preemption of all wares, and sole
trade in some commodities, so that 
Solomon
 (like the great 
Duke
 of 
Tu∣scany
)
counted traffick no abatement to his Majesty. They brought it in

linen-yarn,
 not 
linen-cloth, Solomon
 so setting up 
Napery,
 and the manufacture
of weaving, to the much enriching of the land, and employing of the
poor people thereof. Thus, after his time the finest linen cloth, formerly
a purely forein, became partly a native commodity of 
Iudea;
 as linen,

Egyptian;
 as cloth, 
Iewish;
 spun abroad by the wheels of strangers,
woven at home on the looms of his own subjects. I say not, that 
Solo∣mon

took the first hint of this good husbandry, from the mouth of his
mother 
Bathsheba,
 charactering a good wife,
 
She maketh fine linen, and
selleth it:
 though a family being a little kingdome (as a kingdome a
great family) what is found beneficiall for the one, may by proportion
be extended advantageous for the other.


§ 5. Pass we by fine cloth to come the sooner to 
silk,
 the appa
ell also
of our 
Courtier.
 By 
silk
 we understand not 
Sericum,
 coming from the 
East
Indies,
 where it groweth on trees: nor 
Byssus,
 a soft silk grass; but

Bomby
ina,
 made of silk-wormes, (whereof largely
 before) and of it
plenty in 
Palestine.
 Indeed we finde, that
 
Heliogabalus
 first wore such
silk clothes in 
Rome;
 and that in 
Iustinians
 time (some five hundred
years after Christ) silke-wormes by some
 
Monkes
 were first brought
into 
Europe;
 as also that
 
Cardinall Woolsie
 was the first Clergy-man that
wore silk in 
England:
 but, when silk began first to be worn by the 
Iews,

we cannot exactly define. Onely we finde amongst the many favours
God bestowed on their Countrey, this especially recounted,
 
I covered
thee with silk.
 And thus we leave our 
Courtier
 so gaily apparelled, that his
clothes (according to the Apostles
 complaint) are not onely his 
Usher

to make room; but also his 
Herauld,
 to appoint a principall place for
him to sit down, when coming into 
any assembly;
 whilest others, of less
gallantry, (but perchance more goodness) must either stand, or sit at
his foot-stoole.


§ 6. Come we from the 
Stars
 to the 
Sun;
 from the 
Courti
rs
 to the

King
 himself. Such were conspicuous, and distinguished from their
subjects, by their 
Crown, Scepter, Throne,
 and 
royall Robes,
 which 
Iehosaphat



wore in war to his
 cost, had not Gods goodness ordered, that he was
more 
scar'd
 then 
hurt
 thereby. White garments were worn even by the
Kings themselves. Hereupon when our Saviour as a 
Mock-king
 was
made a derision both to 
Gentile
 and 
Iew▪
 as the Souldiers arraied him in

 
Purple,
 Robes of Magistracy amongst the 
Romans;
 so 
Herod,
 a 
Iew

(conforming his scoffes to custome of his own Countrey)
 
,
clothed him with a 
white garment.
 Sometimes, Kings
did, out of speciall grace, communicate their robes to be worn by their
Favorites, as is
 eminent in the case of 
Mordecai.
 Many and rich (no
doubt) were the habilliments of the 
Iewish
 Kings, but when all was
done, 
Solomon,
 in all his glory, was not arrayed as a
 
Lily in the field,
 more
fine to the touch, fair to the eye, and, which is the main, the 
Lilies
 beauty
is 
his own,
 and 
in him; Solomons
 bravery but 
borrowed,
 and 
upon him.


§ 7. We had almost forgotten the Pharisee,
 who will be offended (as
loving 
the
 
uppermost rooms at feasts, and chief seats in the Synagogues
) if not
having an high, and honourable mention in our discourse. These, gene∣rally,
delighted in
 
Phylacteries
 (and 
fringes
 of the broadest size) being
schedules, or scrouls of parchment, tyed to their 
foreheads,
 or 
left hands
 (by
popular error accounted nearest the heart) wherein the 
Decalogue,
 and,
some adde, four other sections of the Law were written; so carrying a

Library
 of Gods word on their clothes, scarce a 
letter
 in their hearts.
They wore course clothing, pretending much mortification, and 
,

when they exercised,
 (that is, when these 
Mountebanks
 theatrically acted
their humiliation) 
 
, they had 
thornes
 for their bed to
lay upon, and some of them wore a 
Mortar
 on their heads, so ponderous,
that they could look neither upward, nor on either side, but onely down∣ward,
and forthright. But, because the Pharisees affected such clothes
meerly to 
be seen of men;
 out of set purpose, to cross their vainglorious
humour, we will look no longer on their strange apparell, lest we in∣crease
their pride, by our studious gazing on their phantasticall habits.






SECT. V. A Iewish man ornamented cap-a-pe.


§ 1. ALthough it be probable,
 that the ancient 
Iews
 generally went

bare-headed
 (making use with 
Elijah
 of their 
Mantles,
 or upper
garments, in tempestuous weather, 
wrapping
 their heads, as he his
 face
therein) yet we finde them in after ages wearing 
Hats
 on their heads,
with which the 
three children
 were cast into the fiery furnace. Not, that
they were like those we wear now adays, (a meer modern inven∣tion
since round 
flat caps
 were disused) but, are termed 
Hats
 by
analogy, though not of the same form, for the same service, the coverture
of the head.



§ 2. But,
 some will say, if 
Hats
 were formerly fashionable among
the 
Iews,
 how came that 
Order
 of 
Antiochus
 (many years after) to be be∣held
as an 
Innovation,
 of so dangerous consequence in it selfe, and so
distastfull to the 
Iews,
 when he enjoyned them to wear an
 
Hat?
 It is
answered; such 
Hats
 were offensive to the 
Iews,
 not so much for them∣selves,
but because,



1 A forein Power imposed them.


2 An odious instrument (
Iason
 the Pseudo-Priest) pressed the
wearing of them.


3 They came in company with other heathenish
 customes, for
whose sake they fared the worse in the 
Iews
 acceptance.


4 Such 
Hats
 (in Greek 
) were (as I may say) of 
another block

from those, which the 
Iews,
 most tenacious of their native habits,
formerly had used.



But, how the ancient Hats of the 
Iews
 were made, is impossible to de∣fine,
though probably they were of the same matter with their upper
garment. Sure I am, the 
Babylonians
 were more 
top-gallant
 then the 
Iews,

and quite put them down with bravery in that part, as, 
exceeding in died


 
attire upon their heads.
 All that we will adde of Jewish head-attire, is
this, that 
mourners
 amongst them used (in expression of their shame, and
sorrow) to be bound about close, 
The plowmen were ashamed, they
 
covered
their heads.
 Wherefore, when the Prophet foretold,
 
And your tires shall
be upon your heads, and your shooes upon your feet: yee shall not mourn nor weep,
but yee shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one towards another;
 he pro∣nou
ceth
their sorrow so transcendent, as uncapable to be ordered by
the usuall 
method of mourning,
 and onely to be managed with 
amazement.


§ 3. 
Ear-rings
 were generally worn by Jewish women,
 as also by
their male children whilest as yet young, and under their mothers com∣mand;

 
Break off the golden ear-rings which are in the ears of your wives, your
sons, and your daughters.
 Where, by 
sons,
 we understand little boys (there∣fore
hemmed in the text with 
women
 on both sides) having their sex as
yet scarcely discriminated by their habits. But, whether men amongst
them ware 
ear-rings,
 is doubtfull, and the negative most probable; see∣ing
the Scripture, speaking of the eastern Army conquered by 
Gideon, For
they had golden
 
ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites;
 intimates thereby, that
such were no masculine ornaments usuall amongst the people of the

Iews.
 Except any make [
for
] there to relate, not to the 
ear-rings
 them∣selves,
but to the extraordinary multitude, and massiness thereof.
Wherefore, if any be earnest on the contrary, I oppose not; being con∣tented
the 
Iews
 should have 
rings
 in their 
ears,
 so be it they had not 
Idols

in those 
rings,
 a
 superstition of their ancestours, when first coming out
of 
Padan-Aram.


§ 4. Nothing save
 
chaines
 was worn about their necks;
 no linen in
lieu of our modern 
bands,
 which otherwise would have intercepted, and


hindered the beautifull prospect of the 
Spouse
 her neck, when compared
to a 
tower of Ivory.
 As for
 
bracelets
 about their wrists,
 
rings
 on their
fingers, (for gloves we finde none)
 
signets
 in those 
rings,
 herein the

Iews
 nothing differed from other nations.


§ 5. Their legs were generally bare:
 wherefore, when we finde the

Three children
 cast into the fiery furnace, 
in their coats, their
 
hosen and their
Hats;
 by [
hosen
] we understand not 
stockins,
 but 
breeches;
 which (as the

Ie
ish
 Priests
 must wear of 
linen
 for modesty) other persons might for
their own conveniency, or warmth; as probably these children did, as
then living in 
Babylon,
 being somewhat a more northern climate, and
colder countrey then 
Iudea.


§ 6. On their feet, when at home,
 and in summer time, they used to
weare
 
Sandales;
 which had soles, but no upper-leathers, save the liga∣ments
wherewith they were fastned over the 
instep
 and 
cross
 of the foot.
Hence came the frequent washing of their feet in the eastern parts; not
onely to cool them, but chiefly to clear them from the gravell, and cleanse
them from the dirt, which those casements of their 
Sandales
 had let in.
In the winter time, and when they travelled abroad, they wore 
shooes

(which they used to put off when coming on
 
holy ground.
) And it seems
that in fair weather, whilest the Master, for more ease, might walke in
his 
Sandales,
 the servant used to carry his 
shooes
 after him (as our 
Ser∣ving-men

their 
Masters hoods
 on the same occasion) in case that rain, or
foul weather should happen in their journy. Hence that humble ex∣pression,

 
Whose shooes I am not worthy to bear,
 that is, unworthy to per∣form
the meanest servile office unto him. Their shooes were tyed with
a small, and slender latchet, yet big and strong enough, to fasten two
eminent Proverbes on posterity.



1 
From a thread to a
 
shooe-latchet,
 that is, 
nothing at all.


2 
The
 
latchet of whose shooes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose,
 that
is (as aforesaid) unworthy to have the meanest employment
about him.



Nothing else occurs of the 
Iewish
 shooes, save that they were often made
of
 
Badgers skins,
 which (otherwise seeming fitter for gloves then shooes)
served for the upper-leathers, which skins (no doubt) were of finer
grain and dressing in those parts (perchance worn with their fur) then
in our land where the leather thereof is of no considerable value. It is
suspicious, that afterwards some extraordinary cost was luxuriously be∣stowed
on their shooes, when 
the poor was sold for a


 
pair of them.
 Or else
their 
Exchange ran at a strange rate,
 when a piece of a 
dead beasts skin
 was
accounted a valuable compensation for the flesh, whole body, and life
of a man.








SECT. VI. The habits of Girles, Virgins, Brides, Wives, and Widows
amongst the Iews.


§ 1. SO much of the 
Iewish
 male-apparell,
 come we now to their Fe∣minine-attire;
sexes amongst them being solemnly distingui∣shed
by their clothes, according to Gods express command therein,

 
The woman shall not weare that which pertaineth to the man, neither shall the man
put on a womans garment, for all that doe so are abomination unto the Lord thy God:

as in all ages, 
Epicoene Apparell
 hath been the 
Baud
 to much baseness. Onely
herein we are sorry we cannot satisfie our selves, much less the Rea∣der;
so little appears of their apparell in Scripture, though we will dili∣gently
take whatsoever it tenders unto us.


§ 2. We begin with the 
Girles;
 when, first we finde
 
the City full of
boys and girles playing in the streets thereof.
 Let none condemn them for 
Rigs,

because thus hoiting with boys, seeing the simplicity of their age
was a Patent to priviledge any innocent pastime, and few moe years
will make them blush themselves into better manners.


§ 3. For,
 being grown virgins of pretty stature, they were closely
kept under 
covert-parent.
 Whereupon a virgin in Hebrew hath her name
from 
 
to hide,
 or 
keep secret,
 maidens not being permitted to gad
abroad alone, but onely in companies on great solemnities, then exer∣cising
themselves with their own sex, in
 dancing, singing, and playing
on
 Timbrels, accounted maiden melody. Hereupon it was, that 
Amnon

lusting after his sister 
Thamar, thought it
 hard for him to doe any thing to her.

Not, that he made it any difficulty, or scruple in conscience to 
commit
folly
 with her; but all the hardness was in compassing her company,
that was kept so close; and therefore, he was fain, with a fetch, to be∣tray
her into his Chamber. We finde nothing particularly of the attire
of ordinary virgins in Scripture, but onely that the 
Virgin-royall,
 or Kings
daughters, were apparelled with 
garments of divers
 colours upon them:
 of
the severall kindes and makings whereof, we shall treat
 by and by.


§ 4. Now,
 before the Virgin we speake of, prove 
 
past the
prime of her youth,
 her parents have provided an husband for her. Indeed
generally the 
Iews
 married very young, as studiously advancing speedy
propagation of posterity, especially before Christs time, accounting
virginity (after ripe years) a 
petty purgatory,
 and barrenness after marriage
a 
little hell,
 so ambitious all were of children.


§ 5. On her 
wedding-day,
 how gallantly doth she come forth 
as a
Bride
 adorned for her husband?
 She needs not any Art of memory to
minde her to put on her ornaments, for, 
can a Bride
 forget her attire?
Hers,
 to 
use,
 if not to 
own:
 it being a fashion amongst the 
Iews
 (even at
this very day observed by them) that, at a marriage, a 
Bride
 (though


never so mean a person, or silly servant) is decked and dressed in all gay∣itry
lent unto her by her neighbours, so that, that day she appears a mo∣ving
mine of gold, and precious stones. Nor matters it, though the

Brides
 bravery be borrowed on her 
wedding-day,
 if so be that the com∣fort,
and contentment in her match, remain her own all her life after▪
And no wonder, if 
Bride
 and 
Bridgroom
 were both very gallant, when
all their invited guests are highly concerned to be comely; otherwise, if
wanting a
 
wedding garment,
 they are accounted to 
ff
ont all the compa∣ny,
and the welcome occasion of their meeting together.


§ 6. Next day we behold our 
Bride
 a formall wife,
 and amongst all
her clothes we take especiall notice of the
 
vaile
 on her head, in token of
the subjection she gave to, and protection she took from her husband.

Vaile
 in Hebrew called 
 
radid,
 derived from 
radad,
 to 
bear rule and au∣thority,

shewing now she had 
power
 
on her head,
 being under the com∣mand
of an husband. Her vaile was partable from the rest of her clothes▪
witness the complaint of the 
Spouse,
 that, 
The
 watchmen
 (shame on them
for their pains) 
and the keepers of the walls took away her vaile from her.
 This
vaile (as all the other garments of the wife) were provided her all her
life time, on her husbands charge, God taking peculiar order, that in case
her husband should take another wife, yet (amongst other provisions)
his first wives
 
raiment should not be diminished,
 though formerly she had
been but a servant unto him. But wofull the condition of those 
seven
women,
 who (as the Prophet foretells) in a 
dearth of men,
 desiring nothing
with an 
husband
 but an 
husband,
 would be contented, yea willing, and desi∣rous

to weaie their own
 apparell,
 (that is, to clothe themselves at their own
charges) so be it they might have but one man for their husband, to per∣form
conjugall duties unto them.


§ 7. Now,
 as the ordinary 
Iewish
 wives wore clothes proportionable
to their husbands estates: so the honourable women amongst them,
Queens especially, wore 
broidered
 garments, which were of two sorts,



1 Wrought with
 
needle work,
 brought from 
Babylon,
 of which
kinde (for the Art, though not the sex thereof) I 
on
eive was
that
 
Babylonish garment
 which tempted 
he hands of 
Achan
 to sa∣criledge.


2 Woven exactly in imitation of the former, and this properly
called 
, 
Plurimis liciis texta,
 composed of various coloured
threads, like 
branched work;
 first found out at 
Alexandria
 in 
Egypt,

whereof the
 Poet,




Haec tibi Memphitis tellus dat munera: victa est
Pectine Niliaco, jam Babylonis acus.

Affirming that in his age the 
Egyptian shuttle
 had got the victory of the

Babylonish needle.
 Understand him, for the quickness, speciousness,
cheapness, and novelty of the work; not the state, riches, and curiosity
thereof, seeing the wrought garments from 
Babylon
 were like costly



Manuscripts,
 the woven stuffes from 
Egypt
 like 
Printed books,
 done with
less charge, and greater expedition.


§ 8. But besides embroidered clothes,
 we finde the Queen of 
Iudea

once arraied in
 
gold of Ophir
 (as if her garment were cut out of the same
piece with her Scepter and Crown) and made of massie plate. If so,
such bravery was rather to be pitied, then envied, (as all outward great∣ness
is a 
penance
 rather then an 
ornament
) except the hands of her 
Train∣bearers

did lighten the burden thereof. However, it rather appeareth (as
afterward it followeth) 
of
 
wrought gold;
 either onely studded or bossed
therewith, or consisting of golden threads wrought thereinto. Thus
such gallantry was fashionable amongst the 
Iews,
 long before any there∣of
was used in the western parts, or 
Rome
 it self. Where 
Tarquinius Priscus

is by 
Pliny
 affirmed the first who triumphed 
aureâ tunicâ, In a golden coat.

And many hundred years after, the same Author reports for a matter of
greater rarity, that he with his own eyes beheld 
Agrippina
 the wife of

Claudius
 wearing 
Paludamentum auro textili
 (or 
Chlamydem auratam,
 as

Tacitus
 phraseth it) a 
Mantle of cloth of gold,
 as the first which began that
fashion in 
Rome,
 though customary with the 
Iewish Queens
 a thousand
years before.


§ 9. But,
 if our foresaid wife, though a Queen, chanceth to bury her
husband, and so become a widow, presently on she puts her
 
widows-garments,

and
 
anoints not her self with oyle,
 but weares mourning apparell
(or else, it would be accounted a great breach of modesty in her) some
competent time, though the exact limitation thereof be not specified in
Scripture. These 
Widows-garments,
 of what mean and homely matter so∣ever
they were made, had this peculiar priviledge, that they might not
be taken to 
pawn,
 or
 
pledge;
 God 
the Father of the fatherless, and the Iudge
of the
 
widows,
 being so carefull, that no injury should be offered unto
them.






SECT. VII. Of the riot and luxury of the Iewish women
before the Captivity.


§ 1. SO much for the attire of sober,
 and civill Maidens; the
garments of grave and modest Matrons. Another genera∣tion
succeeds, whose husbands might be the 
Sons of Abraham

by their extraction, but these their wives were none of the 
daughters of
Sarah
 by their conditions. Indeed a little before the captivity of 
Baby∣lon
 (luxury is the forerunner of misery) the 
Iewish
 women were arrived


at the greatest height of pride; like those of whom 
Moses
 foretold,

 
The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure to set the
sole of her foot upon the ground, for delicateness and tenderness.
 Oh pride! the
earth, which is
 
Gods footstool,
 is not good enough to be hers. Though
the same one day will be bold to tread on her face, who thought her foot
too good to tread on it.


§ 2. The Prophet
 
Isaiah
 taketh especiall notice of a world of trinkets,

which in his days concurred to dress them:



1 Tinkling ornaments.


2 Caules.


3 Round tires like the moon.


4 Chaines.


5 Bracelets.


6 Mufflers.


7 Bonnets.


8 Ornaments about the leg.


9 Head-bands.


10 Tablets.


11 Ear-rings.


12 Rings.


13 Nose-jewels.


14 Changeable suites.


15 Mantles.


16 Wimples.


17 Crisping-pins.


18 Glasses.


19 Fine-linen.


20 Hoods.


21 Vailes.



But now, as once the 
Eunuch
 said concerning a more mysterious passage
in this Prophet,
 
How can I understand without an interpreter?
 So here
without the same help, who can attain to the meaning thereof?


§ 3. In the first place we may conceive many of these ornaments
were onely temporary,
 as used by the 
Fashionists
 of that age, which
afterwards disused, both name and thing came to be abolished. Which
frequently comes to pass in all kinde of apparell, whose very names by
degrees grow old, wax thread-bare, turne to rents, to rags, to nothing.
For instance, it would pose a good 
Antiquary,
 to describe the exact
fashion of
 
Herlots, Paltocks, Gits, Haketons, Tabards, Court-pies, Chevesailes,

and 
Gipsers:
 barbarous names, which may seem to carry a Spell or
Conjuration in the mention of them. Yet all these were kindes of gar∣ments,
commonly used in 
England
 some four hundred years agoe. Yea,
pride playing in all ages upon conceited opinions of decency, hath in∣finitely
varied the fashion of all apparell, customes of our Ancestours
appearing as antick to us, as our fashions (perchance) will seem in∣credible
to posterity. Who would beleeve, that ever our 
English,
 some
four hundred years since, wore shooes s
outed and piked more then a
finger long, crooking upwards (called
 
Crackowes
) resembling the
Devils claws, which were fastened to the knees with chains of gold,
and silver? Or, that about the reign of King 
Henry
 the fifth, men grew
so excessive in that kind, that it was fain to be ordered by Proclamation,
that none should
 
weare their shooes broader at the toes then six inches?


§ 4. Secondly, of these ornaments, some were necessary, as 
fine-linen;

others modest, as 
Vailes;
 moe (though costly) comely, as 
ear-rings,
 and

bracelets;
 (which
 
Rebekah
 her self, and the best of women did weare)


most of them (some few excepted) though magnificent, lawfull, if not
exceeding the wearers estate. Some therefore will demand why the
Prophet reproved them, and why God was offended therewith? But,
we must know, the things were not so faulty in their own nature,
as for the superfluous variety, fantasticall fashion, and over costly mat∣ter
thereof. But, which is the main, the mindes of the wearers did the
mischiefe, whose fingers (as I may say) infected their 
Rings;
 and
mouthes marred their 
Mufflers,
 being used with pride, and abused to
wantonnefs. The text saith, 
The daughters of Sion were haughty and walked
with
 stretched out necks
 (and 
 to 
boast
 is by
 
Criticks
 deduced from

 
the neck;
 pride being most visible in the erected posture thereof)

and wanton eies, walking and mincing as they goe, and making a tinkling with
their feet,
 carrying (it seems) bells at their heels, whose musick did jar
with modesty, and gave the 
watchword
 to wantons, at what 
Signe
 mer∣cenary
embraces were to be sold unto them.


§ 5. Thirdly,
 of such as were meer superfluities, none appear more
ridiculous and strange then the 
nose-jewels
 in Hebrew 
 leaving us
at a loss how they were fastned. Surely, the 
Iewish
 women were not
ringed 
swine-like,
 nor had they, like the Salvages in 
America,
 their noses
bored through to hang jewels therein. For, although some may plead,

Pride never feels pain;
 as also, that the absurdest fashions, when made
common, seem comely; yet such holes in their noses (moe nostrils
then ever nature made) must of necessity hinder, both their speech,
and plainer pronunciation: except, (as some conceive) they were
fastned with gold, or silver-hoops about thier noses. For mine own
part, I suppose these 
nose-jewels
 the same with 
frontlets,
 frequent among
the 
Iews,
 or else some pendants fastened thereunto:



1 First, because 
frontlets
 (otherwise ordinary ornaments) are
omitted in this catalogue.


2 Secondly, because 
frontlets
 were worn 
betwixt their
 eies
 (between
which and the nose no great distance) hanging down on a peak
from their foreheads.



However, 'tis probable these 
nose-jewels
 were 
frontlets
 of a larger size, more
prominent then ordinary, as pride in process of time improveth it self
to a greater proportion. And most certain it is, God was highly dis∣pleased
with this their luxury; witness his heavy
 commination, 
And
it shall come to pass, that in stead of sweet smell there shall be stinke; and in stead of
a girdle, a rent; and in stead of well-set haire, baldness; and in stead of a stomacher,
a girding of sackcloth; and burning, in stead of beauty.
 Which last curse is omit∣ted
by the 
Septuagint.


§ 6. Now,
 whereas 
baldness
 is threatned to the 
Iewish
 women, i

prompts unto me a passage in 
Hippocrates,
 who (as
 
Seneca
 cites him)
affirmes, that women in his time were neither 
bald,
 nor subject to the

gout:
 and yet
 
Seneca
 confesseth, that the weaker sex in his days, were


subject to both these infirmities; 
Non qu
a mutata foeminarum natura, sed
vita: nam cum virorum licentiam aequaverint, corporum quoque virilium vitia aequa

verunt.
 Though a supernaturall cause must be allowed, immediately to
inflict the same on the 
Iewish
 women, about the time of the Prophets
prediction.


§ 7. Whereas it is said,
 
in stead of beauty burning,
 I question whether it
relateth to the 
Babylonians
 sacking of the City, when
 
they burnt the house
of God, and brake down the wall of Ierusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof
with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.
 Rather I beleeve it referred
to some personall, and corporall malady, which afterwards God in∣flicted
on the bodies of these lascivious women: As 
Fevers,
 or the disease

Erysipelas, A swelling full of heat, and redness with pain about it,
 (called by us
Saint 
Anthonies fire
) or some other pestilent inflammation. Except any
will understand 
burning
 in the
 Apostles sense, for inward lust; that
these women, when ugly and deformed, should still ardently affect
their lovers, by whom they were entertained with neglect, and con∣tempt.


§ 8. The mention of turning a 
sweet smell into a stink,
 mindes me of a
common tradition, that an offensive savour attends the bodies of modern

Iews,
 who (notwithstanding their frequent washing) may be sented in
their company, from those which are 
Christians.
 Indeed the flout of a
fleering Pagan
 Poet herein, workes nothing on my beliefe,

Quod jejunia Sabbatariorum,


Malles, quàm quod oles, olere, Bassa.

More am I moved with the testimony of many credible Merchants in
our age, adding hereunto, that the 
Iewish
 mothers use to buy the bloud
of Christians, from 
Barber-surgeons,
 (who preserve it on purpose) there∣in
to bath the bodies of their new born babes, so to mitigate the rank
smell of their children. However, we leave this as
 doubtfull, having
formerly found their report false, who (literally interpreting that com∣mination,

 
And ever bow down their backs
) affirme all 
Iews
 to be crooked,
or bunch-backed; experience presenting many of that nation (for their
stature) as proper persons, and as streight as any other people.


§ 9. I shall deceive their expectations,
 who conceive I will soile my
book with presenting the exact habits of common 
Harlots
 therein. One∣ly
in generall we learn from Scripture, that with 
Thamar
 the daughter-in-law
of 
Iudah,
 they used to sit
 
covered and wrapt in a vaile, in an open place,
by the way.
 Impudent modesty! shameless shamefacedness
 What a
contradiction was there betwixt her 
gesture,
 and 
posture?
 Why
 
face covered,

if intending to be dishonest? Why in the 
high-way,
 if disposed to be
otherwise? Hereby she professed a private-publickness (the
 twilight
is the 
Harlots
 season) As free to commit sin: so carefull not to be openly


known her self, and (by consequence) not to reveal him who com∣mitted
it with her.


§ 10.
 Adde hereunto that 
painting
 was practised by
 
Harlots,
 adulte∣rated
complexions well agreeing with adulterous conditions. Especi∣ally,
they used to
 
to paint their eyes,
 understand their 
eye-browes
 and 
eye-lids

with 
Stibium,
 to make them look black, conceited by them an extraordi∣nary
comeliness. Hereupon was 
Solomons
 caution, 
Neither let her take
thee with her
 eye-lids,
 as one of her principall nets to catch wantons
therewith. When aged, they used in vain to make themselves fair by

 
renting their faces with painting,
 though more cause to rent them with
their nailes out of penitent indignation. Thus painting, used to recon∣cile,
in time widens the breaches in their faces; and their flesh, tainted
at last with the poison thereof, like rotten vessels, spring the moe leakes,
the more they are repaired.


§ 11. As for the other garments of whores, it is probable,
 that the
publick, and mercenary, were distinguished from honest women, by
some habit peculiar to themselves; 
Solomon
 observing, that one came
forth
 
with the attire of an Harlot.
 Sure I am, the same custome long
since was observed in 
England,
 finding that 
Adam Francis
 Mercer, and

Lord Maior
 of 
London Anno
 1352. procured an 
Act
 of 
Parliament,
 that no
known whore should wear any hood, or attire on her head, 
except raied,

 or striped cloth of diverse colours.
 But, enough, if not too much, of so bad a
subject;
 
Who so pleaseth God, shall escape from her, but the 
inner shall be taken
by her.






SECT. VIII. Of Iewish Grave-clothes, and burying
Ornaments.


§ 1. AFter some few years,
 all the persons formerly described, 
high
and low, rich and poor, one with another,
 meet at 
the house of death,

whither we will afford them our attendance, to behold their
funerall wardrobe. Indeed, by 
Iobs
 confession,
 
Naked shall I return thi∣ther
again,
 all are resolved naked into the 
wombe-generall
 of their Mother
Earth; and
 
When he dieth he shall carry nothing away with him,
 (that is,

actively,
 which he himself can put on, or is sensible of) though 
passively

the dead may be
 
carried out
 with such clothing upon them, as decency,
and modesty requires.


§ 2. First therefore,
 his eyes being closed by one nearest, or dearest unto
him,
 
Ioseph shall put his hands upon thine eyes;
 the body was
 
washed,
 and then
prepared for embalming. This embalming was twofold; either by 
incor∣poration,



substituting spices in the rooms of their 
brains
 and 
bowells
 taken
out, so to preserve their corpses from corruption; an 
Egyptian
 custome, and
so probably
 
Iacob
 and 
Ioseph
 were embalmed: or else onely by 
apposition,

or putting of sweet odours to the dead body, (called by the 
Iews
 
)
after which sort our Saviour was embalmed. Of whom as 
a
bone was not broken:
 so no part of his body was taken away, to hinder
the entireness of his resurrection.


§ 3. The next work was,
 
 
, that is, to con∣trive
the body, and winde it into a modest method. For, though the
pale cheeks of the dead will take no other dye, yet the corpse may 
blush
by proxy
 in the surviving kindred, if not put into a decent posture. After∣wards,
they were wrapped up in a 
Sindon,
 bound hand and foot with grave-clothes

(generally called
 
, and more particularly 
) having

 a 
napkin
 about their heads, single by it self, and not fastned to
the rest of the 
grave-clothes,
 as appears by that napkin in about our Saviours
head, not lying with the clothes after his resurrection, but
 
wrapped toge∣ther
in a place by it self.
 This done, the body was put into a
 
Coffin;
 laid,
and carried out on [
] a
 
biere,
 and then either,



1 Buried, the most
 
ancient and generall
 custome of the 
Hebrews;
 or,


2 Burnt
 with fragrant spices, to qualifie all noisome smels; or,


3 Both, as 
the bodies of
 Saul and his sons,
 whose flesh was burnt, and
bones buried.



As for 
Asa
 his buriall, it was peculiar for the solemnity thereof, they
 
laid
him in a bed which was filled with sweet odours, and diverse kindes of spices prepared
by the Apothecaries art; and they made a very great burning for him.
 And the
reason, that more state was used at his buriall, then others, was because
he was a pious King, and so well deserved it; as also (which was the
main) because he had a godly son and successour 
Iehoshaphat,
 not grudg∣ing
what cost he bestowed on his Fathers funerall. A feast called 
the
bread
 of men,
 and elsewhere 
a
 cup of consolation,
 was made at these burials,
probably at the cost of the friends of the party deceased, to comfort them
at their grief, with moderate refection.


§ 4. We presume,
 the children and friends, of this person deceased,
bemoaned him 
veirs & spirantibus lachrymis, with true and lively sorrow;

otherwise it was common amongst the 
Iews,
 as amongst our modern

Irish,
 to send for 
Mourning women, so
 cunning in wailing,
 that they could
make their eyes 
run down with tears, and their eye-lids gush out with waters,
 so
to furnish forth the Funerall. Such mock-tears were in all ages:

Credidimus
 lacrymis: an & hae simulare docentur?


Hae quoque habent artes, quáque jubentur eunt.


Thy tears were trusted: do they falshood know?


Yea, they have tricks, at will they come and go.

But, as parents, when their children 
cry for nothing,
 use to beat them, that
they may 
cry for something:
 so God threatned that he miseries of 
Ierusalem

should
 afterwards turn their faigned, and strained wailings, into sound
and sincere sorrow; when those teares (formerly but the adopted chil∣dren)


should become the naturall issue of their heavy hearts.


§ 5. Nothing more remains of the 
Iewish
 burying clothes;
 except
any will adde, as part of their Metaphoricall garments, the graves where∣in
they were interred. These were proportioned to the deserts of the
party deceased, and love which the living bare unto him. In which re∣spect

Hezekiah
 was buried in the 
chiefest
 (or
 
highest) of the sepulchers of the
sons of David;
 but whether highest in 
posture
 as nearest to 
David,
 or in
structure, as built most eminent above ground, let others dispute. They
used to 
white over
 their sepulchers to 
appear beautifull without,
 to which the
hypocriticall Pharisees are resembled by our
 Saviour. Yea, the friends
of the dead used to raise, repair, and rebuild such sepulchers many years
after the party was deceased (probably renewing the Epitaphs upon
them:)
 witness the contradiction in the 
Iews
 actions, with one hand out
of pretended courtesie, building and garnishing the tombes of the dead,
whilest at the same time with the other hand, out of reall cruelty, they
killed the living Prophets among them.


Here the Map of 
Jewish Gods
 is to be inserted.




















THE
IDOLS OF THE
IEWS. CHAP. VII.


§ 1. 
I
T is hard,
 exactly to define, when Idolatry first
began. It is generally thought about the days
of 
Enos, Adams
 grandchild; grounded upon

Gen.
 4. 26. though little certainty can be col∣lected
from those words, so variously transla∣ted.
We may safely conceive, it began very
early, in the infancy of mankinde: it being
true of the great 
World,
 what is said of Man the 
Microcosme,
 The wicked are
estranged from the wombe, they goe astray speaking lies, as soon as they be born.


§ 2. If we enquire into the causes of the variety of Idols,
 and far
spreading of superstition, these principally present themselves. First, the
multiformity of error in its own nature. If truth be once casually lost,
but especially if wilfully left, numberless are the by-paths of falshood.
Nothing under an Infinite, can expleat, and satiate the immortall minde
of man. Who having once forsaken God, infinite in power, thought to
fill it self with Idols, infinite in number; leaving still a blank, and reser∣ving
their souls for
 
unknown Gods,
 when they should be added there∣unto.


§ 3. Secondly,
 the mistaking the attribute, of divine Providence.
Men did conceive the whole world, and all therein, too large a compass
for one God to actuate and inform. And therefore as 
Pliny
 observeth,
that the old 
Eagles determinant spatia,
 assign severall and certain circuits to
their young ones to flye and feed in, without interfering each on others
dominions; so the heathen confined topicall Gods to particular places.

Their Gods
 (say
 the 
Syrians
 of the 
Israelites) are Gods of the hills;
 (perchance
collecting the same from the 
Iews
 usuall sacrificing in high places) 
we
will fight against them in the plain,
 and surely we shall be stronger then they.


This mindes me of the speech of a
 
Persian
 in 
England,
 attendant on the
Embassador 
Anno
 1626. who perceiving wealthy people in 
London
 in the
time of the Plague tumultuously posting to their Countrey houses; 
What

(saith he) 
have the Englishmen two Gods, the one for the City, and the other for the
Countrey?
 A mistake in the heathen, which gave the occasion of multi∣plying
of Deities: some shadow of whose superstition, still remains
in Popish 
Saint-worship.
 For whereas Christ gave his Disciples power
to
 
heale all manner of sicknesses, and all manner of diseases
 (not consigning the

Ague
 to 
Peter, Palsie
 to 
Andrew
 &c.) they appoint the severall maladies to the
cure of severall Saints, 
Tooth-ach
 to 
Apollonia, Sore-eyes
 to Saint 
Blaze
 &c.


§ 4. Thirdly,
 the improving of 
Heroicall
 into Divine worship. Anci∣ently
every nation had 
men of renown,
 famous in their generations, meri∣ting
much of their Countrey. Whose memories after their death was
honoured with monuments, statues, Anniversaries of mourning, some
foo
steps whereof are seen in the 
daughters of Israel yearly lamenting the daugh∣ter

 of Iephthah.
 In process of time, popular indiscretion, hightened this
civill, into divine honour, translating such famous 
Heroes
 from the front
of the mightiest men, into the rear of the meanest Gods: as appears by
the propensity of the people of 
Israel
 to adore 
Moses
 when dead, had not
God
 prevented it.


§ 5. Fourthly,
 the assigning severall sexes to their Gods, as
 
Ashtaroth

the Goddess of the 
Zidonians.
 Hereupon the fancy of the Poets were the

spokesmen
 to make love betwixt them, the 
Priests
 to marry, or rather the

Pandars
 to couple; and upon the present impregnation of the female
Deities, the same luxurious fancies were the 
midwives
 to deliver them,
the 
nurses
 to suckle their children. These, when brought up to maturity,
were also disposed in matches, thus filling the world with families of
full grown, and nurseries of infant Deities.


§ 6. Lastly,
 the suggestion of 
Satan,
 who was the 
Master of the ceremo∣nies

in all these superstitions: who as he is a generall gainer by all sins of
men, so he did drive a secret trade, and particularly received unknown
profit by Idolatry; seeing, as the
 Apostle observeth, what they saerifi∣ced, they 
sacrifittced to Devills.


§ 7. In the progress of Idolatry we may observe,
 first, they began to
worship 
glorious creatures, The Sun, with all the host of heaven,
 mentioned by
holy
 
Iob,
 an ancient writer. But all the stars in heaven were too few for
them to adore. Hence they proceed to worship 
usefull creatures, sheep, oxen

&c. stepping thence to the adoration of 
things hurtfull, Dragons, Serpents,
Crocodiles;
 probably in fear, for a 
Ne noceant,
 that they should doe them
no harm. Lastly, they gave divine honour to all creatures in generall,

 
Changing the glory of the incorruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible
man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things:
 their children not
making more babies, then their parents did Idols. But of all, the 
Egyp∣tian

superstition, rather then it would sit out, plaid at the smallest game;


they worshipping besides 
Oxen,
 and 
Sheep, Onions
 and 
Leeks,
 in their gar∣dens:
So that one may justly admire that their superstition did not
starve them. For this being granted, that they would not eat what they
did adore, (which is laid to the charge of the Papists, how truly I have
now no leasure to examine) it is hard to conceive where they found
food to satisfie their hunger, besides the objects of their Idolatry.


§ 8. If now in the next place we descend to enquire, what should
make men so much to dote on the visible representations of their Dei∣ties,
contrary to the nature of a spirit; we shall finde it proceed from
thier infidelity,
 not able to apprehend God under the notion of an incor∣poreal
Being. And therefore to contract the species of their devotion, they
fixed it in a materiall object, lest otherwise with them their God should
be 
out of sight, out of minde.
 Saint 
Lewes
 of 
France
 loved much to hear Sermons,
whilest our King 
Henry
 the third his contemporary, was more for be∣ing
at Mass, saying 
he had rather see his God then hear another speake eloquently
of him.
 This humour of seeing a Deity (though venting it self other∣ways)
possessed the hearts of people in all ages, who being unable to
raise up their minds to conceive God every where, loved to look on him
bodily represented in some materiall Image.


§ 9. Infidelity thus premised as the main cause, two other occasions,

no ways given by God, but ignorantly taken by men, much advanced
such visible representations: First, Gods frequent appearing to the Pa∣triarchs
in a bodily shape. Which being but then assumed, voluntary,
occasionall, and for the present purpose, was misinterpreted by men
for naturall, necessary, constant, and an essentiall part of his Being: and
thence they concluded him a corporeall substance.


§ 10. Secondly,
 Image-making was much advantaged by some ex∣pressions
in Scripture, that God used 
after the manner of men,
 allaying the
purity of his nature, with humane Phrases, so to work himself the bet∣ter
down to our capacities. Should God speake of himself as he is, his
expressions would be as incomprehensible as his Essence. Hereupon,
men, in stead of thinking higher of Gods 
Goodness,
 thought lower of
his 
Greatness,
 and not able to conceive his 
Providence
 by his 
Eye,
 cleare de∣monstration
of his 
Power
 by his 
Arme,
 clearer by his 
Hand,
 clearest by
his 
Finger, attention
 by his 
Eares, gracious presence
 by his 
Face
 &c. fell first
in their brains to fancy, and then with their hands to form him a bodi∣ly
Image, or Idol. Idols, which though (as the 
Psalmist
 observeth) 
they
have mouths and speake not,
 yet are termed by the 
Prophet,
 
teachers of lies,

misinforming men with most false apprehensions.


§ 11. But their impieties stopped not here, but proceeded from a
corporall, to a vicious assimilation,
 and soon after inferred their Gods
conformity to man, as well in lewdness, as in limbes, badness, as bodi∣ly
proportion. This they falsely collected from the impunity of many
profane persons, interpreting Gods silence, consent; as approving,


because not presently punishing their wicked practises. 
These things 
ast
thou done, and I kept
 silence, and thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as
thy self.
 Thus because many 
Theeves
 have thrived by their felonious cour∣ses,

Drunkards
 in their distempers have strangely escaped dangers, and

Harlots
 have grown wealthy by their mercenary embraces; the hea∣thens
have fancied 
Mercury
 the God and Patron of theft, 
Bacchus
 of drun∣kenness,

Venus
 and (as some will have it) 
Flora
 of whoredom, con∣ceiving
such Gods guilty themselves of the same sins, and friends, fa∣vourers,
yea protectors thereof in others.


§ 12. But to return to their worshipping of Idols. True it is,
 the
most knowing and rationall amongst the heathens, adored not the very
materiall Image, but in, under, through, and beyond the same worship∣ped
the true God of heaven and earth. And in all ages some were found
who flouted at such superstitions: amongst these the Poet brings in an
Idol thus speaking.

Olim truncus eram ficulnus, inutile lignum,


Cum faber incertus scamnum facerétne, Deúmve;


Maluit esse Deum.


Time out of minde a fig-tree stock I grew,


An useless block, before the workman knew,


Benches, or Gods to make me, (smal the ods)


Resolv'd at last of me to make his Gods.

Semblable whereunto is the story of a Countrey-man in 
Spain,
 who
coming to an Image enshrined, the extraction and first making whereof
he could well remember, and not finding from the same that respectfull
usage which he expected, (haply because he had not feed the Friers to
their contentment, who accordingly do sell such frowns and smiles)

You need not
 (quoth he) 
be so proud, for I have known you from a Plum∣tree.

But although the wiser sort both of 
Pagans
 and 
Papists
 worship∣ped
God under the Image, so onely faulty in 
symbolicall Idolatry,
 and
breach of the second Commandement, serving the true Deity in a false
and forbidden manner, yet the ignorant people amongst them both,
were directly guilty of dull downright Idolatry, breaking both first and
second Commandement, adoring a false God with a false service. And
as 
Iacob,
 though bound by his own vow to goe on to
 
Bethel,
 yet either
out of faintness or forgetfulness, set up his staffe short thereof at the
City of
 
Shechem,
 where he bought a dwelling; so the devotion of igno∣rant
people, though projecting perchance a longer journey to themselves
to worship God in the Image, tired in their travell, and taking up a
nearer lodging, terminated their worship in that visible object presented
unto them. Thus Gods Spirit, though allowing liberty to the 
Potter
 of
the same clay to 
make one vessell to honour and another to dishonour,
 sharply
reproveth the
 
Carpenter,
 who makes a fire for his warming, and a God
for his worshipping of the self same wood.


§ 13. But grant Idols originally frequent amongst the 
Heathen,
 a
Colony of them began to be planted amongst the 
Israelites,
 much by
their mixture with the men, more by their matches with the women of
those nations of 
Canaan;
 notwithstanding God flat prohibition to


the contrary: 
His
 
daughter shalt thou not take unto thy son, for they will turn
away thy son from following me, that they may serve other Gods.
 Some will say, it
was more probable the 
Iewish
 husband should turn his heathen wife to
true Religion. For suppose her no fool (such unconvertible in a
 
Mortar
)
but one of a tolerable capacity, bearing unfeigned affection to her hus∣band
(obliged thereunto in gratitude for his marrying her, he might de∣stroy)
he having the double advantage of Authority and Verity on his
side, it seems more likely that he should make impression on he beliefe,
then receive infection from her. But here we must know, that he hus∣band
by breaking Gods command in his unlawfull match, forfeited the
vigour and vertue of his arguments, intreaties, perswasions, and threat∣nings
to work upon her. And as his 
sword
 justly wanted the edge of
power, so his 
shield
 deservedly lost all strength of protection, being left
liable and exposed to his wives solicitation, without any fence against
her infection. Yea, grant at first his constancy in the truth as hard as
stone, yet in continuance of time it might be hollowed with that, which

Solomon
 calleth a 
continuall
 dropping;
 and restless importunity advantaged
with bosome-opportunity, may atchieve a seeming impossibility.


§ 14. So much for the occasion of Polytheisme,
 the originall of hea∣then
Idols, and naturalizing such strange Gods amongst the 
Israelites.

Come we now to the particular description of their Idols. Conceive
we this no breach of Gods
 command, 
Make no mention of the name of other
Gods, neither let them be heard out of thy mouth,
 understanding it, by way of
praying to them, praising of them, pleading for them, swearing by
them, but otherwise it is lawfull to mention them occasionally by way
of discourse; yea commendable to name them as detesting their impie∣ty,
deploring mens ignorance, desiring mens information, the right
knowledge of many Scripture-passages, depending on some insight into
such superstitions. Where, before we begin, be it observed, that though
very many the Idols mentioned in Scripture, yet our mistake may make
them more then they were; if erroneously conceiving 
Quot nomina, tot
numina,
 that every severall Idols name we meet with, was a different and
distinct Deity by them adored. O no! As our 
one and onely God
 is known
to us by severall names, 
Iah, Iehovah, El, Elohim, Adonai
 &c. so in apish
imitation thereof, some one heathen God took a principall pride, to
have severall names imposd upon him, and pleased himself much in

, in 
multitude of titles.


§ 15. In setting forth these heathen Gods,
 it matters not what me∣thod
we use, and perchance none at all is most naturall for our subject.

Molten Images are
 confusion,
 saith the Prophet; and therefore, a rude heap
fitter, 
hen an orderly pile, for their description. However, not for their
honour but one ease, we will rank such Idols as we finde in Scripture
worshipped by 
Iews,
 or Judaizing people, Alphabetically; as fol∣loweth.






Adramelech.


§ 16. That is, a 
Magnificent King.
 Surely, seeing such men as made,
named also these Idols, they had been highly to balme, if not fitting
them with illustrious titles. This was not adored by the 
Iews,
 but such

Samaritans
 as from 
Sephervaim,
 came to people the Countrey whence the
ten Tribes were carried captive. His image may probably be conceived,
a Crowned King sitting on a Throne, and the manner of his worship is
expressed in 
Holy
 writ,
 that they burnt their children in fire unto him.
Not that they burnt them to ashes, as they did to 
Moloch,
 (whose service
was 
Hell,
 whilest this of 
Adramelech
 was 
Purgatory
) but, by way of lustra∣tion,
expiation, consecration, and 
Mock-baptisme
 by fire, their 
Chemerim,
 or

Priests
 led the unwilling children, and passed them through the fire on
both sides, where their painfull scorching was rewarded, with the peo∣ples
acclamation, and their parents opinion of merit therein.






Anamalech.


§ 17. As some
 deduce it from the 
Arabian
 word 
 
Ani, Rich,

in effect a rich King, or (if you will) 
Prince Mammon.
 If so, he hath ma∣ny
adorers this day, by
 
covetousness which is Idolatry.
 Others deriving it
from an Hebrew root 
 an 
answering God,
 which shows him more
civill, friendly, and familiar then others of his rank, taking more state
upon them in their sullen silene No doubt, the Devils answers here
were no plainer, then his riddling Oracles elsewhere, which like change∣able

Taffata
 (wherein the 
woofe
 and 
warpe
 are of different colours) seems
of severall hues, as the looker on takes his station: so his doubling an∣swers
appeared such to every ones apprehension, as they stood affected in
their desires. 
Anamalech
 had the same superstitious worship
 with the
former, and was worshipped by the 
Sephervaite Samaritans.






Apis, or Serapis.


§ 18. Was a true living black bull, with a white list, or streak along
the back, a white mark in fashion of an half Moon on his right shoul∣der;
onely two hairs growing on his tail (why just so many, and no
moe, 
the Devill knows
 with a fair square blaze in his forehead, and a
great bunch called 
Cantharus
 under his tongue. What art their Priests did
use, to keep up the breed, and preserve succession of cattell with such

, or privy marks, I list not to enquire. It was adored by the

Egyptians,
 (though not mentioned by name in Scripture) and hence it
was, that they fed by themselves, counting it an
 abomination to eate
with the Hebrews. For, oh! how would their hunger have been tur∣ned
into fury, if tasting of an 
Israelitish
 dish, they should chance to meet
therein with parcell of that God whom they worshipped? This also
was the cause, why 
Moses
 requested three days journy into the wilder∣ness
to sacrifice, refusing to doe it in the land of 
Egypt,
 alledging fear to
be stoned, if 
before their eyes they should offer the abomination
 of the Egyptians,

namely, if he should offer a bull or cow, how mad would the other


have been, at such an indignity, and affront to their Deity.


§ 19. Be
ides this naturall and living Bull, kept in one place, they
also worshipped 
 
a golden,
 or 
gilded oxe,
 the Image or portrai∣ture
of the former. Some conceive this 
Apis
 to have been the symbol,
and emblem of 
Ioseph
 the Patriarch, so called from 
 
Ab, a father,
 seeing
he is said to be made by God
 
a Father to Pharaoh,
 that is, preserver of him
and his Countrey. And therefore the 
Egyptians
 in after ages, gratified his
memory with statues of an Oxe, a creature so usefull in plowing, sowing,
bringing home, and treading out of corn, to perpetuate that gift of grain
he had conferred upon them. They strengthen their conjecture, be∣cause

Serapis
 (which
 one will have to be nothing else but 
Apis
 with ad∣dition
of 
 
Sar,
 that is, 
a Prince,
 whence perchance our English 
Sir
) was
pictured with
 a bushell over his head, and 
Ioseph
 (we know) was

corn-meater
 generall in 
Egypt.
 Though others on good ground conceive,

Oxe-worship
 in 
Egypt
 of far greater antiquity.


§ 20. However, hence
 
Aaron,
 and hence afterwards 
Ieroboam
 (who
flying from 
Solomon,
 lived some years with 
Shishak
 King of
 
Egypt
) had
the pattern of their 
Calves,
 which they made for the children of 
Israel
 to
worship. If any object, the 
Egyptians
 Idols were 
Bulls,
 or 
Oxen,
 the 
Israelites

but 
Calves;
 the difference is not considerable. For (besides the objectour
never lookt into the mouths of the latter to know their age) 
gradus non
variat speciem,
 a less character is not another letter. Yea 
Herodotus
 calls

Apis
 himself 
 a 
Calfe,
 and 
Vitulus
 is of as large acception among the
Latines. Such an old calfe the
 Poet describes,

—Ego hanc vitulam (ne fortè recuses,


Bis venit ad mulctram, binos alit ubere foetus)


Depno—


My Calfe I lay (left you mislike't, both tides


She comes to th'pale, and suckles twain besides.)

But to put all out of doubt, what in 
Exodus
 is termed a 
Calfe,
 the

 Psalmist calleth an 
Oxe.
 Some will have 
Aaron
 to have branded on his
Calfe the privy tokens of 
Apis,
 because it is said, 
after he had made it a molten
calfe
 that he
 
fashioned it with a graving toole,
 this is, say some, imprinted it
with the foresaid characters in the face, back, and shoulder thereof; but
this we leave as uncertain.






Ashima.


§ 21. All that we know of him, is, that he was the God of the men
of 
Hamath
, which were brought into 
Samaria.
 The 
Rabbins
 say, he
was presented as an 
Hee-goate.
 Like enough, Satan much delighted
in that shape, where his staring, frizeled, shaggy hair was fit to affright
folk. Indeed, both Devils and Goats are said to goe out in a stinke, and
so fare they well.






Ashtoreth, in the Septuagint Astarte.


§ 22. Her 
Hebrew
 name signifieth 
flocks,
 either because worshipped
in the form of a 
Sheep,
 as the 
Iews
 will have it, or because (as 
Scaliger
)
whole flocks were sacrificed to her. What if because supposed protector
and preserver of flocks in those eastern Countreys, as in the west,



—Pan curat oves, oviúmque magistros.


Pan he doth keep, both Shepheard and Sheep.


Ashtaroth,
 saith the Scripture, was the Goddess of the 
Sidonians
. 
Tully
saith the same,
 
Venus Syria Tyróque concepta quae Astarte vocatur.
 But, though
the 
Sidonians
 did originally invent, they did not totally ingross her to
themselves, the 
Philistines
 having a share in her service, who hung up

Sauls
 Armor in the
 
House of Ashtaroth,
 as acknowledging their victory
atchieved by her assistance. In the vacancy
 of the Judges, the worship∣ping
of 
Ashtaroth
 was first brought into 
Israel;
 which afterwards, by the
advise of
 
Samuel,
 was solemnly banished out of the land, untilll 
Solomon

in his old age, befooled by his wives,
 introduced it again. Her image
was the statute of a woman, having on her own head the 
Head
 of a Bull,

where the hornes erected resembled the Crescent 
Moon,
 and his curled
hair (falling down on her forehead) betokened (forsooth) the fiery
beams therof. This Goddess was very tender of her self, and carefull
not to catch cold; for, besides the 
Grove
 over her image, she had also

Curtains
 over her 
Grove,
 which the women weaved for that purpose,
till 
Iosiah
 took order to destroy them.






Baal.


§ 23. That is, 
a Lord,
 being the name generall for most Idols. Here∣at
haply the Apostle
 reflected, when acknowledging (according to
common language) 
there be Gods many, and Lords many.
 But, we take
this wherof we treat, to be 
Chiefe of the Baals,
 the most ancient, and emi∣nent
of his name. A 
great Lord
 no doubt, who could 
qualifie
 four
 hun∣dred
and fifty Prophets for his 
Chaplains.
 He was served with
 
bowing of
the knee,
 and his Priests, in a religious frenzie,
 used to 
cut themselves with
knives and lancers, till the bloud gushed out upon them.
 Oh
 how doe some go
down hill with difficulty, and take pains to the place of eternal Pain?
In the 
interim
 betwixt the
 Judges, 
Baalisme
 was first brought into 
Israel,

which in the days of 
Samuel
 was
 publickly abandoned by the people. Af∣terwards
the worship of 
Baal
 ebbed and flowed variously, as followeth:



In Israel.


1
 
Iezebel
 daughter to 
Eth-baal
 King of the

Zidonians
 wife to 
Ahab,
 brought in 
Baal
 (as
part of her portion) into 
Samaria.


2 
Eliah
 gave his worship a mortall wound,
when killing four hundred and fifty of his
Prophets at mount 
Carmel.


3. 
Iezebel
 before 
Ahabs
 death, recruited the
number of 
Baals
 Prophets, to about
 four
hundred, and set up his service again.


4 
Ichoram
 her son (best of all the bad Kings)
put away the image
 of 
Baal,
 which 
Ahab

had made.


5 
Iehu
 so totally and finally routed 
Baal,
 and
his Priests, that they never after rallied up
their forces in 
Israeal.




In Iudah.


1 
Athaliath Iezebels
 daughter, publickly plan∣ted
the service of 
Baal
 in 
Ierusalem,
 and be∣stowed

 on him, all the 
dedicate
 things of the

House of the Lord.


2 
Iehoiada
 rooted it out, when he slew 
Mattan

 Baals
 Priest, before the Alter.


3 
Ahaz
 set up bank-rupt 
Baal,
 with a new
stock, and made molten
 images for his
service.


4 
Hezekiah
 is presumed to have destroyed

Baal,
 amongst the rest of the images, which
he brake in pieces.


5 
Manasseh
 reared up
 Altars for 
Baal,
 and
made a grove for him in imitation of 
Ahab.


6 
Iosiah
 made an
 utter abolition of 
Baal
 out
of the land.



Then was fully acomplished, what God by his
 Prophet had foretold,



I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be re∣membred by their name.


§ 24. Some will aske, that seeing 
Baal
 is made a Man by 
Eliah, He is a God

 pursuing his enemies
 (which is no womans work) how comes Saint

Paul
 to make him female 
Rom.
 11. 4. 
, where
the feminine article speaks him, or her rather, of the weaker sex? It is
answered, 
 the Image, or something equivalent, is understood. If
this satisfie not, even, 
Let, Baal plead for himself,
 and make his own vindi∣cation
for the monstrosity of an 
Hermaphrodite.






Baal-Berith, and Baal-meon.


§ 25. I take these to be the same with 
Baal,
 onely distinguished by
the place wherein they were worshipped. Thus the 
Lady
 of 
Lauretta
Hall,
 and 
Walsingham,
 are not severall persons, but the same adored in
sundry 
Shrines. Baal-Berith
 (perchance because first worshipped in 
Berithus

a City in 
Phoenicia
) had a Temple in, or near 
Shechem,
 whence 
Abimelech

took seventy pieces of silver to raise his
 Army. 
Baal-meon
 was placed
in the Tribe of 
Reuben.






Baal-peor.


§ 26. Taking his name from 
 
to lay open, Deus apertionis,
 an Idol
which 
shewed all
 that 
Adam
 covered with fig-leaves. The
 Fathers make
him to be the beastly God 
Priapus.
 No wonder then if grave 
Cato
 went
off from the stage, at the Plays presented to the honour of the God 
Bacchus,

accounting such scurrility inconsistent with his severity, seeing none
could contentedly behold the image of 
Baal-peor
 (the Idol of 
Moab
 and

Midian
) but first must sacrifice all his modesty unto it. And we may be
well assured, where the Idol was naked, the Idolaters were not covered,
so that both sexes assumed much licentiousness in their feasts, and merry
meetings, as appears by the impudency
 of 
Cozbi
 and 
Zimri.


§ 27. One thing I much admire at, in the worship of 
Baal-peor,
 that
such as adored him (as the Psalmist observeth) did 
eat the sacrifices
 
of
the dead.
 Me thinkes, each morsell they put into their mouths, should
mar their mirth, and the very mention of 
the Dead,
 make them 
all amort.

Their warm and wanton embraces of living bodies, ill agreed with
their offerings 
Diis manibius, 
to
 gashly Ghosts.
 This inclines me to that
learned
 mans opinion that by 
sacrifices to the dead are
 intended no 
Inferiae,

or 
obsequies to the departed,
 but onely meer offerings to the 
Idol,
 a liveless,
dull, dead, and inanimate thing; in opposition whereunto, God so

 often in Scripture is styled the 
living Lord.






Bel.


§ 28. The same (say some) with 
Baal,
 onely he was a 
Phenician,
 this
a
 
Babylonish
 Deity. This 
Bel
 was the grand confounder of so many
barnes, flocks, and vineyards, spending daily twelve
 measures of fine
flowre, forty sheep, and six great pots of wine. Surely he deserved to
forfeit his large fare, by the Apostles
 rule, 
He that will not work, let him not


eat,
 finding no activity in this Idol, proportionable to his voracious ap∣petite.
Indeed his Priests, and their famiy are said to make riddance of
all those victuals; and although the whole story may be challenged to be

Apocrypha,
 yet so much thereof as relateth to 
Bels
 devouring belly (so be∣leeved
by a vulgar errour) seems framed in some analogy to Canonicall
truth; witness the threatning of God in the
 Prophet. 
And I will punish Bel
in Bablyon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth, that which he hath swallowed up.






Baal-Zebub.


§ 29. That is, the 
Lord of flies;
 but, whether so called, from bringing
or banishing of 
flies;
 from causing, or chasing them away, is not de∣cided.
Indeed the 
Iews
 account it one of their 
constant miracles
 in their
Temple,
 that whereas naturally (as 
where the carcase is, thither will the Eagles
resort:
 so) flies swarme where sacrifices are slain, yet not any of such
troublesome insects infected their Altar, whilest plenty thereof about
the sacrifices of 
Baal-zebub.
 Of this Idol formerly in
 
Dan,
 here I onely
enter my dissent from their opinion, who conceive 
Baal-zebub
 a nick∣name
given in derision to the God of 
Ekron.
 Surely sick men speake
seriously, and 
Ahaziah
 his fall had not so far crazed his intellectuals (cal∣ling
him 
Baal-zebub
 in his Commission to his messengers) as to send a
mock by their mouth to that God from whom he begged a boon,
 and
hoped to have a favorable answer. At which time those messengers
were remanded by 
Elijah,
 and soon after the two Captains with their
fifties sent to attach him burnt with fire from heaven, whilest the third
saved himself with
 submissive language; a 
Petition
 working more
then a 
Mandamus
 on the spirit of the Prophet. 
Bel-zebub,
 or 
God of flies,

passeth in the Testament for the
 
Prince of Devils.
 Indeed, as flies have
their felicity in inflaming of raw sores: so the Devill delights in height∣ning
each 
pimple
 into a 
scab; scab,
 into a 
boyle, boyle,
 into an 
ulcer; ulcer,
 into
a 
fistula;
 endevouring to improve our smallest sins by his temptations in∣to

unpardonableness,
 if Gods mercy prevent not his malice.






Chemosh.


§ 30. Notoriously known to be the abomination of
 
Moab;
 yet so
that this Idol was held in 
Coparcenary
 betwixt them, and the 
Ammonites;

witness 
Iephthah
 his question to the King of 
Ammon,
 demanding restitu∣tion
of the land of 
Gilead
 from the 
Israelites,
 
Wilt not thou possess that which
Chemosh thy God giveth thee to possess?
 Thus as 
Moab
 and 
Ammon
 once parted
the incestuous extraction from the same
 
Grandfather:
 so now they met
again at the Idolatrous adoration of the same God. We finde nothing
in Scripture of the fashion, or worship of 
Chemosh,
 onely we read in

 
Benjamin
 an ancient learned 
Iew,
 that at 
Gebal
 in a Temple was found
the Idol of the children of 
Ammon
 (certainly either 
Chemosh,
 or 
Moloch
)
being 
an image of stone gilded over, sitting on a throne, betwixt two female images
also sitting, having an Altar before him whereon incense was offered,
 as we in our
draught have designed it accordingly.








Dagon.


§ 31. Neither good 
flesh
 nor 
fish,
 but a mixture of both, bearing 
fish

in his 
name,
 and 
flesh
 in his 
head,
 and
 
hands.
 Indeed the heathens observe
the 
Syrians
 generally to have adored fish: 
Piscen Syri venerantu
,
 saith

Tully.
 Yet dare I not impute Gods not apointing any 
fish
 to be sacrificed
unto him, to his detestation thereof on the foresaid account; but rather,
either because being 
ferae naturae
 they could not be constantly gotten for
the 
continuall sacrifice;
 or because it was hard to bring fish 
alive
 to 
Ierusa∣lem

many miles by land, it being essentiall to the sacrifice to be presented

quick
 at the Altar when offered thereupon. But of 
Dagon
 formerly in

 
Dan.






The Ephod▪


§ 32. This by the primitive institution thereof, is sufficiently known
for a Priests
 vestment. Indeed, once we finde 
David,
 when dancing be∣fore
the 
Arke,
 wearing
 an 
Ephod,
 but in what capacity let others dispute:
surely not with any 
crilegious invading of the Priest-like office. Per∣chance,
(as formerly our 
English Kings
 at their 
Coronation
 wore a 
Dalma∣tica

with sleeves, a Sacerdotall garment: so) 
David,
 as 
custos utriusque tabu∣lae,

and being by his place to provide that the Priests should perform
their office, habited himself (especially on that occasion) in some gene∣rall
conformity to their function. But leaving this to others, as God by

A
rons
 chiefe
 
Ephod
 informed such as inquired of him, so Satan (Gods
Ape in his 
Temples,
 Priests, Prophets, Altars, Sacrifices, 
Oracles,
 and 
Ephods
)
counterfeited in his mock-
Ephods,
 to resolve such as asked counsell there∣at.
Thus the 
Danites
 before their expedition against 
Laish,
 consulted the

 
Ephod
 which 
Micah
 had in his house, concerning their success. 
Gideon

also made an 
Ephod
 of the spoiles of the 
Midianites,
 which we charitably
beleeve might be (when first made) a 
Virgin
 (as innocently intended by
him, onely for a civill memoriall) but in fine proved an 
Harlot,
 when all

Israel went a
 
whoring after it.
 So that such an 
Ephold
 may pass under the no∣tion
of a 
Iewish Idol.






Milcom.


§ 33. That is, 
their King.
 If any object, that the 
points
 therein answer
not exactly to that sense; know their Gods were too great to be ranked
under Grammar Rules: (
Iupiter
 we know irregularly declined both in
Latine and Greek) and some grammaticall 
Anomaly
 is conceived to con∣duce
the more to their magnificence. It was the God of the
 
Ammonites,

and was the same with 
Moloch,
 as may appear, because what
 
Amos
 cal∣leth

, Saint 
Luke
 rendereth 
Moloch▪
 according to the judicious ob∣servation
of the most learned
 Father, concerning 
Apostles,
 and 
Apostolicall
me
,
 citing places out of the 
old Testament,
 Illos non verba considerare, sed sen∣sum,
nec eadem sermonum calca
e vestigia, dummodo à sentent
is non recedant.






Moloch.


§ 34. A monstrous Idol. Nothing came amiss to him, having 
Stow∣age



enough to receive whatever was offered unto him. It was an hollow
image of brass, having seven repositories therein; one for 
Meal,
 a second
for 
Turtles,
 a third for a 
Sheep,
 a fourth for a 
Ram,
 the fifth for a 
Calfe,

(like to which was the head thereof) the sixth for an 
Oxe,
 the
 seventh
for a 
Child,
 which it first embraced in its armes, and then (
Hags
 hugs
kill with kindness) seared to death, having fire made under the conca∣vity
thereof. This murder of children was acted near 
Ierusalem,
 in a place
remarkable for its double name,


1 
The valley of the sons of
 
Hinnom.
 So called from the skreeking
of children (
 
Nahem
 is
to 
roar out
) when sacrificed
there.


2
 
Tophet.
 From 
 
Toph
 a
 
drum,
 loud
musick being used to inter∣cept
the childrens crying from
their parents hearing it.
But, had not such parents ears as well is their hearts, as on their heads, to
sympathize with the suffering of their own flesh and bloud? And see∣ing
these Tragedies were acted in their presence, why had not such pa∣rents,
(as musick to keep the sound from their eares, so) maskes to hide
the same from their sight? But, what shall we say? They may be ranked
amongst those of whom the Apostle speaks, 
Whom
 
the God of this world
hath blinded.
 Superstition depriving men both of 
Grace
 and 
Nature
 to∣gether.






Nergal.


§ 35. He was adored by the
 
Cuthites,
 by whom we understand such
who (before their transplanting into 
Samaria
) dwelled at or nigh 
Cuth,

a river in 
Persia.
 His name may be deduced from 
 
Ner, light
 or 
fire,
 and

 
gal, rolled
 or 
wreathed:
 the raies of the one, and flakes of the other
appearing waved or curled to the beholder. Hence we conceive this

Nergal
 of the 
Cuthites
 to be a 
constant fire
 which they adored as the sym∣bole
of the Sun, notoriously known to be the grand Deity of the 
Persians.

As indeed 
fire
 is the the terrestriall 
Sun,
 Whence the 
Stars
 of our torches and
tapers borrow their light. Yea, such the purity, clarity, and activity
thereof, that though it be not to be called a God, God is pleased to call
himself 
a
 
consuming fire.






Nisroch.


§ 36. A God of the 
Assyrians,
 in whose Temple 
Sennacherib
 was a
worshipping, when
 slain therein by 
Adramelech,
 and 
Sharezer
 his sons.
This was he who so lately boasted, 
Where is the King of Hamath, of Arphad,
of Sepharvaim,
 
of Henah and Ivah?
 Let now one more be added to that Ca∣talogue,

And where is Sennacherib the proud King of Assyria?
 Many were
gainers by his death; God got the honour of the action, 
Isaiah
 the per∣formance
of his prophecy, 
Hezekiah
 riddance from his worst enemy,

Esarhaddon
 his son and successour got the kingdome of 
Assyria,
 and his
two sons who slew him,
 got exile into the land of 
Armenia,
 too fair a
reward for so foul a Patricide. Now though we finde not this 
Nisroch



by name to be worshipped by the 
Iews,
 yet because the
 Prophets com∣plaint
is generall, that they 
doted on the Assyrians their neighbours,
 we may
conclude them guilty of spirituall whoredome with 
Nisroch
 as a princi∣pall

Idol
 of that Countrey.






Nibhaz.


§ 37. This and 
Tarkah
 were the Idols of the
 
Avites,
 of whom no∣thing
save their names extant in Scripture, (though the 
Rabbies
 fancy
the one like a 
Dog,
 the other an 
Asse
) and it is a good hearing that we
hear no more of them. Some heathen accounted those men happiest
that were never born, and those next that died the soonest: so we esteem
those Idols least bad which never appeared, and next them such as are
most obscure, the manner of whose mischievous worship have left the
least impressions to posterity.






Queen of Heaven.


§ 38. God himself most justly is styled 
The King of heaven
 by
 
Nebuc∣chadnezza
;

but by 
Queen of heaven
 in the
 Prophet, (superstitiously wor∣shipped
by the 
Iews
) we understand the 
Moon made to rule the night.
 Let
her be deposed from her Regency, if willingly accepting of this usur∣ped
title, and their unlawfull offerings: but seeing mans importunity
forced them upon her against consent, the 
Moon
 is as free from idolatry,
as the 
Virgin Mary
 from superstition, on whom 
Regina Coeli
 is obtruded
by the 
Roman Missals.
 The Cakes offered unto her must needs be most
compleate, seeing each one in the family had a finger in the making
thereof. 
The
 Children gather the wood, and the Fathers kindle the fire, and the
women 
knead the dough to make cakes for the Queen of heaven.
 Their servants be∣ing
conceived too mean to be used in so high an employment.






Remphan, or Rephan.


§ 39. Onely mentioned by Saint 
Steven
 in his purgation of himself,
and that with such difference from the text in the old Testament, that
learned men have much adoe to reconcile it.

AMO
 5. 26.
 
But yee have born the Tabernacle of
your Moloch, and Chiun, your Images,
the Stars of your God which yee made
to your selves.
 
ACTS 7. 43.
Yea, yee took up the Tabernacle of
Moloch, and the Star of your God
Remphan, figures which yee made, to
worship them.

The main difficulty is this: how comes 
Chiun
 in the Hebrew to be ren∣dered

Remphan
 in the Greek? not the same letter (save the last) being
found in the one as in the other. The best solution we meet with is as
followeth:



1 By 
Chium
 (as 
Aben-ezra
 will have it) the Planet 
Saturn
 is meant.

Plautus
 in his 
Penulus
 calls the same 
C
un,
 as a learned
 Critick hath
observed, and the 
Egyptian Anubis
 called 
Cyon
 in Greek,
 
Plu∣tarch

conceives to be the same with 
Saturne.


2 
Rephan
 in the 
Coptick
 language, a tongue extant at this day (partly


consisting of 
Greek,
 and partly of old 
Egyptian
) is used for 
Saturn,

as an
 Author well skilled in that tongue hath informed us.


3. The 
Septuagint
 we know was written in the land of 
Egypt,
 at the
instance of 
P
olemaeus Philadelphus,
 where the Translatours using

Rephan
 the noted name for 
Saturn
 in stead of 
Chiun,
 altered the
word and retained the sense, a liberty lawfully assumed by the
most faithfull interpreters.


4. Probably Saint 
Steven spake
 to the 
Iews
 in their own language,
but Saint 
L
ke
 writing in Greek, alledgeth his words according
to the Septuagint translation.



This I conceive to be most satisfactory amongst multiplicity of answers
by severall Authors applyed to the place.






Rimmon.


§ 40. An Idol of 
Syria
 whose principall Temple was in
 
Damascus.

The name signifieth a 
Pomegranate,
 as one will have it; who there∣upon
concludes it to be 
Venus,
 because 
Apples
 were dedicated unto her,
and her image commonly made with such fruit, as a frolick, in h
r hand.
More probable it is, that this God got his name from 
 
Rum,
 that is,

high,
 or 
exalted,
 used so frequently in Scripture of the true God, and of
them abused to their Idol.






S
ccoth-Benoth.


§ 41. This was made by the
 men of 
Babylon.
 The 
Rabbines
 (ac∣cording
to their assumed liberty, to fancy any thing without reason ren∣dered
thereof) conceive this Idol, 
A Hen and her Chickens.
 We stick to the
originall notation of the word, 
The tents of the daughters,
 conceiving there∣by
meant some Temple-like Tents, by them made and erected in the
honour of 
Mylitta
 or 
Venus Urania
, known for an eminent Deity in

Babylon:
 unto which tents their daughters were sent, there to doe their
devotions. How honest they went in we know not, it is suspicious they
came out none of the chastest, the bargain of their uncleanness being
driven, though not performed in that place. That
 
 Binos, Venos
Venus,
 is deduced from 
Benoth
 in 
Succoth-Benoth,
 is learnedly observed for
probable by
 M
r
. 
Selden
 in his excellent book 
de Diis Syris.
 From whom
I have, with the
 
children of the Prophets,
 not onely borrowed an 
Axe,
 but
most of the 
tools
 and 
timber,
 wherewith the structure of this our 
Iewish
Pantheon
 is erected.






Teraphim.


§ 42. A word plurall in the sound and termination (like 
Penates
 in
the Latine) yet single in the sense thereof. Three sorts of 
Teraphims
 ap∣pear
in Scripture, in the originall;



1 
Common,
 onely an ordinary carved image, such as
 
Mic
ol
 is said
to have laid in her bed, making a 
mock-David,
 or counterfeiting
her sick husband therewith.


2 
Religious,
 in which sense the Prophet threatneth, that 
Israel



should
 
remain many days without King, Prince, Sacrifice, Image, Ephod
and Teraph
,
 that is, a Prophet to instruct them in future oc∣currence.


3 
Superstitious;
 such as
 
Micah
 made, which foretold the 
Dan
tes
 of
their future good success.



This we conceive some Image acted and informed by the Devill, ac∣cording
to his serpentine knowledge shrewdly guessing at all contin∣gences.






Thamuz.


§ 43. That is, 
Adonis,
 as Saint 
Hierom
 conceives, whom most Latines
doe follow. 
Adonis
 is known by all for a 
Phenicia
 Deity, so called from

, 
Adone, A Lord
 in 
Hebrew.
 And the Poets are almost hoarse with
singin the sad El
gies, how 
Venus
 bemoaned 
Adonis
 killed by a 
Boar.
 In
mythologie this is true, when wan
on women bemoan their beautifull
youth, slaughtered with old age, leaving the print and mark of his teeth
and tuskes in the wrinkles furrowed in their faces. But seeing 
Adonis
 is
generally conceived to be the 
Sun, Venus
 her mourning at his death, rather
represents the generall griefe of northern men, when the 
Sun in Iune

(called 
Tham
z
 by the 
Iews
 and their neighbours) takes his leave of
them in the tropick of 
Cancer,
 and retreateth southward, making shorter
days by d
gre
s. This 
Phenician
 superstition infected the 
Iews;
 
Then he
brought me to the doo
 of the gate of the Lords house, which was towards the north,
and behold there sat women weeping for Tammuz:
 And why the gate towards
the north? Because the body of the 
Sun
 never appearing in that quarter
of the heaven, it was the fittest place to bemoan the absence thereof. Had
not those womens tears been better expended on the death of 
Iosiah,
 ac∣cording
to that
 ordinance in 
Israel?
 But we may be well assured, such
eyes as wept for 
Tammuz,
 were dry for 
Iosiah.






Conclusion.


§ 44. Many other obscure Deities were adored by the 
Iews,
 which we
purposely omit. For never was 
Rebecca
 more
 weary of conversing with
the 
daughters of Heth,
 then we of describing these heathen Gods. Enough
therefore of
 
nothing,
 for so all Idols are termed by the Apostle. The
rather because that as the Psalmist observeth,
 
In the night all the beasts of
the forest creep forth, the Sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them∣selves
down in their dens:
 so when the 
Sun of the Gospell
 displayed his light, all
these herds of heathen Gods hasted to their homes, their lurking in
eternall obscurity. Then was the
 Prophets prediction accomplished,
that all Idols should be cast 
to the Moles and to the Bats.
 Excellent compa∣ny,
it is pity to part them: let the blind converse with the blind, it being
true of these that 
they have eyes and see not.


§ 45. Yet to give the 
Iews
 their due, in the days of our Saviour they
were so free from Idolatry, that the very name thereof, or the word

Idol,
 is not to be found in the four 
Evangelists.
 For having smarted seven∣ty


years in 
Babylon,
 and sensible that their Idolatry principally caused
their captivity, after their return that sin was de
ested by them, and
shunning open profaneness, they reeled into spirituall pride, hypocrisie,
superstitious observing the 
Sabbath,
 equalling Traditions with Scripture
&c. sins chiefly reproved in the Sermons of our Saviour.


§ 46. As for 
Christians,
 their principles pres
rv
 them from 
formall

worshipping of Idols, though too often guilty of what may be termed,

tralatitious Idolatry,
 when any thing (good and lawfull in its own nature)
is loved, or honoured above, or even with God himself. Thus money
may and must be loved and used, as the 
Centurion
 did his
 servant, 
Doe
this, and he doth it,
 fetch me meat from the shambles, and money fetcheth
it, bring me clothes from the shop, and money bringeth them: But,
when the man shall turn master, and money command him, 
Commit such
a sin for my sake,
 and he obeyeth, such ba
e
 
Covetousness
 is by the Apostle
termed 
Idolatry.


§ 47. Indeed Idolatry is a subtill sin; and seeing by nature we retain
in our hearts the principles of all old Errors, it is to be feared that this
sin finding its usuall way obstructed, will watch its own advantage,
to vent it self by some other conveyances: Yea as Pride may grow out
of humility; so Idolatry may sprout out of the detestation thereof;
when men (like 
Iehu
 rooting out 
Baal▪
 and erecting his own opinion
of
 merit therein) shall detest, damn, and destroy all images, and wor∣ship
their own imaginations.

To the Right Honourable
JOHN
LORD BVRGHLEY
Son to the Right Honourable
JOHN
EARL OF EXETER.


MY LORD,


I
T is confidently reported of the 
Stork,

(plenty of which build in the 
Low-Countreys,

being 
Inmates
 in most chim∣neys)
that she usually thro
eth down one
of her young ones out of the nest, as a 
Rent

to the 
Land-lord
 of the 
house,
 for permitting th
re her quiet
and unmolested habitation.


Now as our Saviour sends us to such Masters, [
Behold the
fowles of the
 aire &c.
] of them all to learn the generall lesson
of a 
contented dependence on divine providence,
 (and
particularly 
Innocence
 from the
 
Doves
) so may this
practise of the 
Stork instruct
 us to be gratefull to such as
have bestowed courtesies upon us.



Now the first light which I saw in this world was in a

Benefice
 conferred on my Father by your most honourable
great Grand-father, and therefore I stand obliged in all
thankfulness to your family. Yea this my right hand which

grasped the first free aire
 in a Manor to which your Lordship
is Heir apparent, hath since often 
been catching at a Pen,

to write something in expression of my thankfulness, and now
at last dedicates this Book to your Infant honour. Thus as my
Obligation bears date from my 
Birth,
 my thankfulness makes
speed to tender it self to your 
Cradle.


I know it will be objected, that your Lordship is 
infraannu∣ated

to be the 
Patron
 of a Book in the strist acception thereof:
For a 
Patron
 properly is appealed to as 
Judge of the Me∣rits

of a Treatise. Yea 
Authors
 anciently-craved their

Patrons
 consent (as dutifull children their 
Parents
 leave)
whether that he thought it fit their work should be matched
to the 
Publick view,
 or rather remain in the 
single estate
 of
privacy. This censure some will cavill at me that your tender
Age is unable to pass, and therefore incapable of being a

Patron.


In answer hereunto, first I am assured, none of those who
please to call themselves 
Roman Catholicks,
 will lay
this to my charge. If they doe, I return them with the story
confessed by their 
Champian,
 of a child not fully five years old
consecrated 
Archbishop of
 Rhemes,
 by Pope 
John
 the
tenth, sinc
 which time some children of small age, (but great
birth) have been made 
Cardinalls,
 though long since their
Church of 
Rome
 had been off the 
hooks,
 had it had no
stronger 
Hinges.


But generally I plead in my own defence, that 
Custome


Custome
 hath much mitigated the rigor of the word 
Patron,

which is not currant in common discourse, at so high a rate
whereat first it was coined, insomuch that a 
Negative vo
ce

is denied to many 
Patrons
 now adays, and they generally used
not for 
Censurers,
 but 
Countenancers
 of books dedicated
unto them, in which notion I humbly request your Lordships
patronage of our present endevour.


Our 
London
 Gardiners doe not sow or set all their seeds
(though of the same kinde) at the same time, but so that they
may ripen successively, to last the longer in 
season.
 Such is
my design, planting a Nursery of 
Patrons,
 all Noble, but of
different years, a 
Babe,
 a 
Child,
 two 
youths
 of severall date,
and a 
Man,
 (having as a 
Scale of miles
 in my 
Maps,
 a Scale
of 
Ages
 in my Honourable Patrons) hoping so always to have
one or more in full power to protect my endevours.


Thus in process of time your Lordship (as yet but a 
Patron
in reversion
) will be 
possessed
 with power effectually to dis∣charge
that place. As for the present, let not your tender age be
slighted by any, seeing such an one (
 
 a little 
child
) was
chosen by our Saviour to be 
Doctor of the Chair
 to determine
the controversie between the Disciples; which he truly decided,
not by his speech, but humble silence. Till such time as your
Honour shall be able to learn by my writing, may I learn from
your Honours living the necessary vertues of Meekness, Hu∣mility,
Quietness, Contentedness. For the continuance of which
in your Honour, with the daily addition and increase of other
Graces proportionable to your growth, the hearty prayers shall
never be wanting of


Your Honours
most bounden servant

OBJECTIONS ANSWERED
Concerning this
DESCRIPTION. The fifth Book.




CHAP. 1. The intention of the Author in this Treatise.


P
LATO
 being sick said to the Physician being about to
prescribe Physick unto him, Cure me not 


as a Countrey-oxe-driver,
 but 
, as one well
versed in Philosophy; and demanded of him the
reason of his receipts, how the medicine was proper
for his malady, 
why this, why thus, why now, why thus
much, why no more
 was prescribed unto him. In like manner it seemeth
unreasonable for Map-makers, here to plant a wood, there mount a hill,
here to sink a valley, there to run a river in their draughts; and then
magisterially obtrude all these on the beliefe of an ingenuous Reader,
without giving a particular account how the same are conformable to
Nature and true Geography: especially seeing it is vehemently suspected,
that many maps are full of affected extravagancies. And must their
fancies draw up the forms for other mens judgments to subscribe?


But on the other side it seems not onely an ungentile harshness, but
an unconscionable injustice, strictly to exact a reason for every 
Puntillo

in a Map. Gally-slaves would be in a more freer condition then Geo∣graphers,
if thus dealt with. As the Poets feign 
Atlas
 was wearied by
bearing the weight of heaven, 
Mercator
 would be more tired by bearing
the burden of his own 
Atlas,
 if questioned for the crookedness or straight∣ness
of every line in so vast a volume. A lawfull latitude herein hath


been ever allowed. For instance, it is generally agreed that 
Meander,
 a
River in 
Phrygia,
 runs wonderfully winding; but it breaks not the head
of Truth in a Map, if a curle of that River be made more or less, or be
put out of its proper place. Let the Stewards of Lords Courts, or rather
Bailifes of Gentlemens Manors know each nook of a wood, corner of a
field, reach of a River within so small a compass; such as describe a
Countrey in generall, if truly presenting the most materiall things there∣in
without visible disproportion, doe what their diligence can exactly
perform, and what the Readers discretion can rationally expect.


Desiring therefore to acquit my self in the best manner to all ingeni∣ous
capacities, I have here exposed my self to the strongest objection

which without favour or flattery, I could make against the former de∣scription.
And left scattering of them before in the respective Tribes
should have interrupted the entireness of our discourse (what thred can
run smooth if full of so many knots? we have reserved them all for a
small Treatise by themselves in the conclusion of the work. Solemnly
promising that if any shall enfavour me so far as to convince me of any
error therein, I shall in the second Edition (God lending me life to set it
out) return him both my thanks and amendment, or else let him con∣clude
my face of the same metall with the Plates of these Maps.


Whatsoever can be objected against the 
Generall description of Iudea
 re∣turns
in the particular Tribes, and therefore to avoid repetition we shall
there more properly meet with it. This premised, without further de∣lay
(by Gods blessing) we fall on the matter in hand. And can we be∣gin
higher then at 
Adam
 it self?






CHAP. II. Objections concerning Reuben answered.


Philogus. Alethaeus.




Philol.


I First take exceptions at your placing the City 
Adam
 so near
unto 
Iordan.
 For where it is said, 
That the waters which came down
from above, stood and rose up upon an heape, very
 
far from the City Adam, which is
besides Zartan,

you make 
Adam
 not above three miles from that stoppage
of waters, which is not very far.






Aleth.


Very far,
 is a relative terme, and accordingly admits of much
alteration. Three miles is little in respect of so many leagues, but very
far in respect of so many furlongs. Attend I pray you the main scope of
the holy Spirit, which was to notifie the place where these upper waters
failed in view of the 
Israelites.
 Which must be acknowledged within the
discovery of their sight; otherwise the land-mark more obscure, then
the staying of the waters that were dated from it. Where therefore the


distance is measured in a plain Countrey by the eye, three miles may
well pass for very far.






Philol.


Why make you so great a flexure in 
Iordan
 just at his influx into
the 
Dead-sea,
 contrary to the nature and custome of great Rivers? In∣deed
small brooks like little children goe wadling on one side, their
streams are winding and crooked, because they must run where they
may run, and finde soft ground to receive them. But great Rivers
which doe not finde but make their way, flow generally in a straight
channell, and so it seems should 
Iordan,
 sliding through a flat, low, and
levell Countrey, and not meeting with any effectuall opposition.






Aleth.


I have sufficient warrant for this my description. 
Pliny
 saith
of 
Iordan, Invitus Asphaltit
n lacum, natur
d dirum petit; unwillingly he goes into
that slimy Lake, terrible by nature.
 You perchance will say, 
Iordan
 needs not
to follow the motion of 
Plinies
 pen, as if because he makes a flourish
with his phrase, the River must fetch a compass with his channell. But
consider, I pray, how in the mixture of all liquours of contrary kinds,
the best liquour (which may be said to lose by the bargain) incorpo∣rates
always with a reluctancy, and the same Antipathy causeth here this
crookedness of 
Iordan.
 This is precisely taken notice of by learned
 
S
l∣masius,

and is agreeable to the observations of modern Travellers.






Philol.


You place three severall stations of 
Balak
 and 
Balaam
 with
seven altars a piece upon them in this Tribe of 
Reuben,
 whereas more
probably all those passages were transacted south of 
Arnon
 in the King∣dome
of 
Moab.
 It is utterly unlikely that King 
Balak
 would adventure
his person out of his own dominions, into a strangers (not to say an
enemies) Countrey.






Aleth.


In so short a journey the pains was little, the danger none at all.
For (although on 
Balaks
 side there might be private▪ heart-burnings)
there was no open hostility betwixt 
Israel
 and 
Moab.
 Yea we know that
then the 
Israelites
 had familiarity, much with the men, too
 much with
the women of that Countrey. I confess the places as described in Scrip∣ture
stand (as I may say) equivocally betwixt 
Israel
 and 
Moab.
 But here∣in
I have followed the example of
 
Adrichomius,
 and other good authors,
not to say, that if 
Balak
 had taken his view in the kingdome of 
Moab
 of
the people encamping then at 
Abelshittim,
 he could not at that distance
have taken a discovery of them.






Philol.


M
r
. 
More
 in his Maps bringeth down the 
waters of Nim
im

(with a stream in breadth corrivall, if not bigger then 
Arnon
 it self)
running through the very midst of this Tribe into the 
Dead-sea,
 whereof
no appearance at all in your description. It was a very envious part
of the 
Philistines
 to
 stop up the wells of 
Isaac,
 (so needfull a commodity
in that Countrey) but how great a fault in you to deprive 
Reuben
 of
this river, except it was not your envy that stopped, but ignorance that
omitted it?








Aleth.


I am sensible full well of such waters, but cannot be convin∣ced
that they took their course through this Tribe into the 
Dead-sea,
 but
rather conceive they ran onely through the Tribe of 
Gad,
 and emptied
themselves in 
Aroer,
 whereof in due time we shall give our best account.






Philol.


I wonder you make 
Nophah
 so near to 
Medeba
 contrary to

 others descriptions, which set it thence twenty miles at least.






Aleth.


I wonder they place it so far from 
Medeba
 contrary to the
words of the
 Scripture, 
and we have laid them wast unto N O P H A H which
reacheth unto M E DE B A:
 where the verb, though supplyed by the
Translatours, is implyed in the Text.






Philol.


Why make you three fishponds in 
Heshbon,
 to which the

eyes of the
 
Spouse
 are compared, which is in effect to make her a mon∣ster if the resemblance be applyed?






Aleth.


I set a certain for an uncertain number: in the originall it is 
 plurall, and therefore indefinite. In all these comparisons, the
strength of the similitude lies in the nature, not the number of the things.
They deserve not the name of 
a flock of sheep
 which are under an hundred,
to which the teeth of the Spouse are
 compared, and nature commoly
allowes not above thirty two.






Philol.


The City of 
Misor
 belonging to the 
Levites,
 and recorded by

Adrichomius
 in this Tribe, is omitted by your oversight.






Aleth.


Commendable is his charity to the 
Levites.
 For whereas 
Moses

allotted them but four Cities in 
Reuben,
 namely
 
Kedemoth, Iahazah, Me∣phaah,

and 
Bezar:
 his bounty bestoweth a fifth, this 
Misor,
 upon them.
But the poor Priests might well be full lean, had they nothing to feed
them, but this imaginary City, groundless in the Hebrew, and onely
founded on the erroneous Vulgar. Yea generally the descriptions of

Adrichomius
 are guilty herein, that (more made 
ad splendorem,
 then 
ad veri∣tatem
)
to render them specious to the beholder (because a lean bald
Map is not so amiable as one filled full) he poulders them thick with
places, rather scraped then gathered, thereby offending the judgments of
the learned to please the eyes of the ignorant. But it is my business to
excuse my self, not accuse him, and consciousness to my own many
faults, commands me to be tender to the errors of others.








CHAP. III. Objections concerning Gad answered.




Philol.


VVHy make you the City of 
Iazer
 so in-land into this
tribe, which 
Adrichomius
 placeth on the River of 
Arnon?






Aleth.


I can demonstrate, it could not stand on that River, and by
consequence must be more within the Tribe of 
Gad.
 For, 
Arnon,
 is noto∣riously
known to be the eastern bound of 
Canaan▪
 Now attend what



Moses
 saith, 
And the suburbs of the Cities, which yee shall give unto the Levites,
shall reach from the wall of the City, and outwards a thousand Cubits round about:
And yee shall measure from without the City on the east side, two thousand Cubits,
and on the south side two thousand Cubits, and on the west side two thousand Cubits,
and on the north side two thousand Cubits, and the City shall be in the middest, this
shall be to them the suburbs of their Cities. Iazer
 therefore being a City of the
 Levites, could not stand upon 
Arnon,
 because they could not measure
three thousand Cubits eastward, for then they should take so much out
of an enemies Countrey, which belonged not to 
Israel.
 Where we may
also observe, that no sea-town was allotted the 
Levites,
 because, for
the reason aforesaid, it would have proved less unto them, hindering the
circular dimensions of their possessions.






Philol.


You are much mistaken in the placing of the City of 
Aroer.
 The

 Scripture saith, that it is before 
Rabba,
 or as 
Tremellious
 rendreth it, 
ante
conspectum Rabbae,
 within the view, or sight of 
Rabba.
 Whereas your
Map presents it six and twenty miles off from that place. 
Lynceus
 his eyes need a prospective-glass to discover 
Rabba
 from 
Aroer,
 at the distance in
your description.






Aleth.


Judicious Sir
 
Walter Raleigh
 answers in my behalf; that 
Rabba,

near to which

Aroer
 was seated, was not (as you erroneously conceive)

Rabba
 of 
Ammon,
 to which it was neither near, nor in sight, (as he wor∣thily
observes) but 
Rabba
 a chief City of 
Moab.
 Which 
Rabba
 bordered on 
Aroer,
 as in our Map of 
Moab
 doth appear; though, here straitned fro room, no mention is made thereof.






Philol.


You ill observe Scripture-instructions, in fixing the first tent
of 
Ioab,
 when sent to number the people. For the
 text saith that the he

pitched in Aroer
 (that is, in the Countrey not City of 
Aroer,
 wherein I con∣cur
with you) 
on the right side of the City that lyeth in the midst of the River of
Gad, and toward Iazer.
 Be your own judge, whether or no, the tent be set

Aleth.


The chief directory in placing this tent is the word 
right hand,

and that relative term is varied, according as the face is setled. If 
Ioabs

face in his journy respected the north, then the east is the right hand
of the City, and then the posture of the tent is rightly placed. However
the best is, a tent is but a tent, no solid or substantiall structure, it will be
no great work, or weight, on better grounds, to take it down and re∣move
it.

IN

Soccoth
 fifteen miles from

Nurses

Drovers
 (the most competent judges in this controversie)
whether it be not too long a journy, 
for little Children and E

except you conceive, miles are as easily gone on the grounds, as measu∣red
in a Map with the Compass.






Aleth.


Though in 
Iacobs
 Gests, 
Succoth
 succeeds the next place to 
Peniel,



yet it follows not, that 
Iacob
 with his train went so far in one day. Pro∣bably,
he might bait, yea lodge severall days betwixt them; the Scri∣pture
not mentioning every stage of his staying, but onely marking sig∣nall
places, whereat some memorable accidents did happen, or wherein
for some considerable time he made his abode.

Sir 
Walter Raleigh
 (whose judgment you deservedly honour)
makes the River of 
Iabbok
 the northern bound on the matter of the Tribe
of 
Gad,
 therein following the example of 
Adrichomius.
 Whereas you ex∣tend
this Tribe many miles beyond that river, even to the sea of 
Cinneroth

or 
Galilee;
 a great tract of ground, which you injuriously take from 
Ma∣nasseh,

and bestow on this Tribe.






Aleth.


I exactly follow Scripture directions, in dividing this land be∣twixt
them.
 The text saith expresly, that the border of the inheritance of
the 
Gadites
 reached 
even to the edge of the sea of Cinneroth,
 and therefore the
land betwixt 
Iabbok,
 and the edge of the sea, undoubtedly belongs to this
Tribe, which justly may have an action of trespass against the foresaid
Author, for depriving it of so considerable a part of its true possession.
And yet (under favour) I conceive, M
r
. 
More
 in his Maps doth much
overdoe, stretching the inheritance of this Tribe to the utmost, and
most northern part of the sea of 
Galilee.






Philol.


I admire much at your inconstancy. In your Map of 
Palestine,

some seven years since prefixed to your 
Holy War,
 you set 
Iabesh-Gilead

north of the river 
Iabbok
 in the Tribe of 
Manasseh,
 which now you have
translated many miles southward into this Tribe. It seems, you need no other to confute you but your self.






Aleth.


I have seen mine
 error, and you see my retractation thereof. 
One
day teacheth another.
 To live, and not to learn, is to loiter, and not to live.
Confessions of our former mistakes, are the honourable Trophies of our
conquest over our own ignorance. The main reason, why 
Iabesh-Gilead

could not be so far north, is this, because 
Saul
 marched from 
Bezek
 in the
Tribe of 
Ephraim,
 with an army of foot, in an afternoon and a night, over

Iordan,
 unto this City, and came hither in the
 
morning-watch.
 Now though
we allow, that zeal to their brethren in danger, spurred on the souldiers,
and did 
horse
 those 
foot
 in point of speed, yet they almost needed wings,
in so short a time to goe so long a journey (fifty miles at least besides the
crossing of two great rivers, 
Iordan,
 and 
Iabbok
) and to come thither so
early. Wherefore with master 
More
 we have placed 
Iabesh-Gilead
 south
of 
Iabbok,
 some thirty miles from 
Bezek,
 having the concurrence of
other Authors for the position thereof.






hilol.


You have found a nest of Cities in the
 
Apocrypha,
 and
place them all in this Tribe. Whereas two of them, namely,

Bozra
 and 
Betzer,
 are by learned
 
Tremellius
 found to be, the
one in 
Edom,
 the other in 
Reuben,
 many miles from the Tribe of

Gad.








Aleth.


I deny not, but two Cities of the foresaid names are presented
in those Countreys, but could not be the same, with these Cities which

Maccabeus
 relieved. It is expresly recorded (once
 and again for the more
certainty thereof) that these places were in the land of 
Gilead.
 And that
any part of 
Edom,
 or 
Reuben,
 was ever reputed to belong to the land of

Gilead,
 is as I conceive an opinion unpresidented in any good author,
and unavouchable by any strong argm
nts.








CHAP. IV. Objections concerning Manasseh beyond Jordan answered.




Philol.


YOu have made the countrey of 
Manasseh
 beyond 
Iordan,

too large in the dimensions thereof. for, it being the porti∣on
but of half a Tribe, is, according to your scale of miles, little less in
proportion, then the Countrey which other entire Tribes did possess.






Aleth.


I confess the truth of what you alledge, which is no whit strange
in it self. What more common then to call a Twin, 
half a man?
 Yet I
doubt not, but you have seen such half-men, as proper persons, as any
single-born. And the moiety of this Tribe, possessed as much ground,
as most other whole Tribes in 
Israel.
 This may appear by the number
of Cities, no fewer then
 threescore contained therein. Yet under fa∣vour,
I conceive, that the land east of 
Iordan
 was not altogether so civi∣lized,
but more wilde, and warlike, then the countrey west thereof.
Especially this of 
Manasseh,
 subject to hostile incursions from the north
and east; and therefore their portion was cut out in the largest size, that what they wanted in the quietness, they might have in the quan
ity of their possessions.






Philol.


You make 
Chorazin
 within two miles of 
Capernaum,
 whereas
M
r
. 
More
 in his Maps, placeth it on the west side of the sea of 
Galilee,

hard by 
Bethsaida;
 in my minde with more probability of truth. For,
our Saviour saith,
 
Woe be to thee Chorazin, woe be unto thee Bethsaida,
 coupl∣ing
them together in his commination, who probably would have
joined 
Capernaum
 and 
Chorazin
 together, for the vicinity both of their
profaneness, and place, had they been seated so near together, as they are
presented in your description.






Aleth.


Your argument concludes nothing at all. Have you not often
seen malefactours manacled together, whose places of birth and breed∣ing
were farthest asunder? So might it be with 
Chorazin,
 and 
Bethsaida;

whilest 
Capernaum
 is singled out, and set solely by it self, in our Saviours
threatning, as a signall offender, most eminent for its ingratitude. As
for our placing of 
Chorazin,
 we have therein observed the instructions
of Saint
 
Hierome,
 and other good Authours.








Philol.


You make the brook 
Cherith
 in this Tribe, without rendering
any reason, why you place it here; which 
Adrichomius
 (no doubt on
good ground) appointeth to be on the west side of 
Iordan,
 in the Tribe
of 
Ephraim.






Aleth.


The brook is but once mentioned in Scripture, and therefore
we want exact instructions for the position thereof. Yea generally the
Maps of 
Palestine
 take no notice of this brook. As if it had been so dried
up, with the long drought in the days of 
Eliah,
 that the channell thereof
did not afterwards appear. But to the point; Two things are obser∣vable
in Scripture, concerning the post
re of this 
Cherith;
 First, that 
Eliah

after his message done to 
Ahab
 in 
Samaria,
 was commanded to turn
himself
 
Eastward:
 Secondly, that the brook 
Cherith,
 whither he was sent,
is said to be 
before Iordan;
 the Hebrew hath it 
 and 
Tremellius
 ren∣dereth
it 
è regione Iordanis;
 All which put together, clearly speaketh it,
to have been 
ast of 
Samaria,
 and on the other side of 
Iordan,
 where judi∣cious
M
r
. 
More
 in his Map hath placed it, whom I conceive my self to fol∣low
on good reason.








CHAP. V. Objections concerning Naphtali answered.




Philol.


YOu make all the Tribe of 
Naphtali
 west, and on this side
the River of 
Iordan;
 whereas that passage foretold by the

 Prophet, and applied by the
 Evangelist, describes it on the other side;

The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali by the way of the sea beyond Iordan,
Galilee of the Gentiles.
 The particle 
beyond
 is 
 in the Greek, which
makes it plain, that 
Naphtali
 lay on the east side of 
Iordan.






Aleth.


The strength of your objection consists in the words 
beyond
Iordan,
 which are variously rendered by learned men. By 
Tremellius
 in

Isaiah secundum Iordanem,
 by the same Author in 
Matthew, transitus Iordan;

by 
Beza, secus Iordanem.
 The dicision of the difficulty depends on the
proper sense of the preposition 
 
nebher,
 in Hebrew; which barely
imports no more, then 
over;
 but which way, whether 
Cis,
 or 
Trans;

whether on this side, or beyond, is to be expounded by the context.
This flexible nature, and promiscuous sense of 
 
Gnebher,
 is observed
by
 
Tremellius,
 and others; so that the text alledged by you, renders no
more, then the land of 
Naphtali
 over 
Iordan,
 without specifying any side
of the river. Secondly, we answer, that those words 
beyond Iordan,
 are
so indifferently placed in the Prophet, that they may equally be referred,
to what followeth, 
Galilee of the Gentiles;
 part of which 
Galilee,
 we have

 formerly described, to lie east of 
Iordan,
 and therein the City 
Chorazin,

wherein our Saviour so frequently conversed.






Philol.


You make two fountains, the one 
Ior,
 the other 
Dan,
 as the


father and mother of the River 
Iordan:
 a fancy (I fear) rather pretty,
them solid; bearing too much affinity with the derivation of the River

Dourdan
 in 
France,
 from the confluence of the two streams, 
Dour,
 and 
Dan;
 whilest such a composition hath more of 
Latine,
 then 
Hebrew

therein. Not to say, that 
Iosephus
 is wholly silent hereof, I suspect it for a
modern conceit, unavouchable by ancient Authors; and prefer his opi∣nion

 as most probable, who deduceth 
Iordan
 from the 
Hebrew
 
 
Iarad,

to descend, because it 
comes down with a powder,
 and at set times
 
overflowes,
all his bankes.






Aleth.


The negative argument from 
Iosephus,
 is of small validity; but
to attest the antiquity of 
Iordans
 descent, according to our description,
grudge not to read the following testimony of 
Philostorgius,
 both because
he is an ancient Author (living in the fifth Century after Christ) and
his book at this day not extant, save that some parcells of his are recited by 
Ioannes Antiochenus,
 out of whose
 
Manuscript,
 not yet printed, the
following words are transcribed, 
. 
In this Countrey of Paneas one of the fountains of Iordan is be∣gotten,
there being two of them; Dan so called even to this day from the ancient name
thereof. As for the other, which is named for, a certain hill of the same
 mountain
sendeth it forth, distant from the former about an hundred and sixty furlongs; from
either of which flows a rivolet, the one termed Io
ates, the other, Danites, which flow∣ing
by the mountains to the foot of the plain, thence forthwith compleate one great Ri∣ver
Iordan, in the same mingling both their names and streams.
 See here an ex∣cellent
evidence of the extraction of 
Iordan,
 which cannot be condem∣ned for a modern invention. However if any will deduce 
Iordans
 name
from a 
third fountain,
 (that 
Hebrew word
 aforesaid) let him herein con∣tentedly
embrace his own opinion.






Philol.


If you stick so stedfastly to the authority of 
Philosto
gius,
 why dissent you from him in the distance between those two fountains, which 
e makes an hundred and sixty furlongs, that is, twenty miles, (if
eight furlongs make a mile) and the 
interstitium
 in your Map amounts not fully to half so much?






Aleth.


Some mistake may justly be suspected in 
Philostorgius
 his num∣ber,
because for exceeding the proportion in other Authours. I
 former∣ly
acquainted you with that 
arbitrating power
 I have assumed (I hope
not unjustly) to reconcile such differences in Authors by pitching on a
middle number betwixt their extremities, and here have made use of the same power accordingly.






Philol.


What mean you by these eight nameless buildings sur∣rounding


the City of 
Cesarea Philippi?






Aleth.


They are set there to signifie the 
townes of Cesarea Philippi
 menti∣oned
by the
 Evangelist, whereabouts Saint 
Peter
 gave that eminent testimony of the Deity of our Saviour.






Philol.


At 
Dan
 in this Tribe (
aliàs Leshem,
 and 
Cesarea Philippi
) you
erect one of 
Ieroboam
 his 
Calves;
 whereas
 
Brocard,
 who exactly survey∣ed

Palestine,
 in his 
Iournall
 gives us to understand, that half a league from

Bethel, where one of the Calves were set up,
 stood a mountain called 
Dan
 op∣posite
thereunto, where the other Calfe was erected.






Aleth.


His authority cannot countervaile Saint 
Hieromes, Benjamin in
Itinerario,
 and others, yea Truth it self, which are on our side, and against
his opinion. For, 
Ieroboam
 was too good an husband to lavish both his
Calves in one place, which he rather would scatter in distant Cities, the
better to spread Idolatry in his kingdome. Besides, consider the end
pretended at their erection, namely to spare the peoples pains, 
It is too


 
much for you to goe up to Ierusalem,
 that these 
Calves
 should be (as it were)

Chappels of ease,
 to save his subjects a tedious journey. Now, if both his

Calves
 were penn'd up in a stall near 
Bethel
 (as 
Brocard
 would have it)
little ease thereby was given to the northern Tribes, and their journey
not considerably shortned. Therefore the other 
Calfe
 was set up at 
Dan

in 
Naphtali,
 as we have described it.






Philol.


All that you have said, doth not satisfie me, that this 
Dan
 was
the place where the 
Calfe
 was worshipped. For, soon after 
Ieroboams

death, in the reign of 
Baasha,
 this 
Dan
 you speak of was
 
smitten
 by 
Ben∣hadad

King of 
Syria.
 This, probably, would have extinguished 
Calfe∣worship,

if set up in that place, which notwithstanding
 continued many
hundred years after in the kingdome of 
Israel.






Aleth.


You might argue on the same grounds, that the other 
Calfe
 was
not erected in 
Bethel,
 seeing even in the life of 
Ieroboam, Abijah
 King of

Iudah took from him
 
Bethel with the towns thereof.
 Observable herein is di∣vine
Justice, punishing both those idolatrous places by the sword of
their enemies, so soon after the 
Calves
 were set up in them. But, we may
be confident, the Kings of 
Israel
 recovered both 
Dan
 and 
Bethel
 again, and
restored them to their former impious uses.






Philol.


In the Worthies of 
Naphtali
 you account on 
Hiram Solomons

Architect in building the Temple,
 as a 
Naphtalite
 by the mothers side:
And yet in the
 description of 
Dan
 you make him a 
Danite
 by his female
extraction. Now, what saith 
Nicodemus?
 
Can a man enter the second time
into his mothers wombe?
 Yea, can he be born (as you would have it) twice,
though not of the same, of severall women?






Aleth.


This your objection is not brought against my description,
but against the very letter of the Scripture that affirmeth the
same.


1 KING. 7. 14.
He was a widows son of the Tribe of
Naphtali, and his Father was a man of
Tyre.
2 CHRON. 2. 14.
The son of a woman of the daugh∣ters
of Dan, and his father was a man
of Tyre.

Now although I am not ingaged to meddle with the solution of this
difficulty; yet, under favour, I conceive the same properly to depend
on an observation in Chorography. May you be pleased to remember,
that 
Dan
 had a parcell of his portion acquired by conquest, near the
fountains of 
Iordan,
 where 
Leshem, Laish,
 or 
Dan
 was placed, which
small territory lay above an hundred miles from the main body of that
Tribe, surrounded about with the Tribe of 
Naphtali,
 as appeareth in
our
 description thereof. Now I suppose 
Hiram
 (whose paternall ex∣traction
from 
Tyre
 is confessed on all hands) was descended a 
Danite
 by
his mother, and called a 
Naphtalite
 also by his mothers side, because of
her habitation (though in 
Dans
 small Countrey aforesaid) lying in the
land allotted to 
Naphtali.






Philol.


You term it
 
a most erroneous opinion
 in such, who conceive the

Galileans more drossie Iews then the rest,
 herein contradicting your self, ha∣ving
formerly
 affirmed, that they were 
courser, and less refined Iews.






Aleth.


Give me leave to distinguish, between 
Iews
 courser in 
Religion,

and courser in 
Extraction.
 The former we confess, that the 
Galileans
 were
less pure in Gods service, as probably descended from the remnant of
the ten Tribes: Yet were they most truly the 
lost sheep of Israel,
 not deba∣sed
by mixture of 
Gentilisme
 in their bloud, like the 
Samaritans,
 whom
Christ declined, whilest he constantly conversed with these 
Galileans.






Philol.


You say, that the City 
Naasson
 depends meerly upon the credit
of the vulgar translation 
Tobit
 1. Whereas looking on the 
Hebrew Map,

graven at 
Amsterdam
 by 
Abraham Goos,
 but designed, and made by another

Abraham
 a 
great Rabbin,
 skilled in the land, and language of his
own nation, this 
Naasson
 appears there in 
Hebrew
 characters, the Author
(no doubt) having good assurance for the same. Whose Map (I can tell
you) is much valued by many 
Antiquaries,
 as appears by their difficult
procuring, dear purchasing, and carefull preserving thereof. And you
may finde it solemnly set up, at the upper end of 
Sion Colledge Library.






Aleth.


It ill becomes me to detract from the pains of any, being also
my self, 
a man under authority
 of the pens, and tongues of others, and 
Can∣didate

for the Readers good will in this my description. Yet, give me
leave, plainly to profess, that the Map by you alleadged, answereth not
the great price, and generall praise thereof, being nothing else but 
Adri∣chomius

his Map translated into 
Hebrew.
 What once Sir 
Iohn Old Castle,
Lord Cobham,
 spoke jeastingly, that the Priests made Christ 
to be boots, and
spurs, and all
 in the Sacrament, may I serously say that 
Adrichomius,
 with
his faults, and failings, dross, dirt, and all together, without any cor∣rection,
is cast into this 
Abrahams
 overvalued description, so that the


Map you alledge is not 
gold,
 but mean metall 
gilded over,
 containing
surreptitious names out of the 
Vulgar Latine
 therein 
Hebraized,
 and pre∣senting
many spurious places utterly disclaimed in the 
Originall.








CHAP. VI. Objections against Asher answered.




Philol.


I Admire you have altogether omitted the River 
Eleutherus
 in this
Tribe (much mentioned in
 
Maccabees,
 and which 
Adrichomi∣us

makes to fall into the 
Mediterranean
 in the mid-way betwixt 
Zidon
 and

Tyre.
 Yea,
 M. 
George Sandys
 in his travels, going from 
Sarepta
 to 
Tyre,
 crossed
a little valley divided by the River 
Eleutherus,
 called 
Casmire
 at this day by
the inhabitants thereabouts.






Aleth.


By what name, or title soever, the water, he there went over,
is known at this day, sure I am, it cannot be the ancient 
Eleutherus,
 which
by 
Ptolemy, Strabo,
 and generall consent of all Authors, falls above
sixty miles more northward, into the 
Mediterranean.
 And therefore
the error of 
Adrichomius
 and 
others
 herein, is briefly taxed by judicious Sir

 
Walter Ralegh.






Philol.


You make 
Asher
 to border on 
Zidon,
 contrary to the descrip∣tion
of
 
Wolsegangus Wiseburgius,
 and learned
 
Tostatus,
 who set 
Zebulun

in the same place, as the most north-west of all the Tribes, and alleadge

 
Iacobs
 words to avouch the same, prophecying, that 
Zebuluns borders
shall be unto Zidon.






Aleth.


Gods
 Word, the coast of the Countrey, and all good authors
justifie our description, those two onely excepted which you alleadge,
being both deceived, by taking 
Zidon
 restrictively in 
Iacobs
 prophecy,
for the City so called, whereas the whole Countrey thereby is intended
(as 
Sarepta
 is called a City
 of 
Zidon
) and the name of 
Zidonians
 adequate
to 
Phenicians,
 in which sense 
Zebulun
 confined on the 
Countrey,
 though

Asher
 onely on the 
City
 of 
Zidon.






Philol.


You peremptorily place the defeat of 
Ben
adad,
 and fall of

Apheks
 wall on his flying 
Army,
 in this Tribe, not remembring the while,
that there is another
 
Aphek
 in 
Issachar,
 (nearer to 
Samaria
) which puts
in with more probability to be the theater, whereon that tragical accident
was acted.






Aleth.


I confess 
Aphek
 a place in 
Issachar,
 but finde it not charactered
to be a City, such an one as our
 
Aphek
 in 
Asher
 is described, and whose
walls are therefore more probable to doe the foresaid execution. How∣ever,
be it known unto you, whensoever two places are with equall
likelihood corrivals for actions therein atchieved, we adjudge it to
that place, that falls first under our description. Thus, the start of half an


hour, bestows on 
the elder twin,
 the whole inheritance. To avoid con∣fusion,
and prevent repetition, 
first come, first serv'd;
 the place first occur∣ring,
carries away all history in our describing thereof.








CHAP. VII. Objections, against Zebulun, answered.




Philol.


YOu, very confidently, make 
Iordan
 continue his un
ixit
stream, clean through the 
Galilean-sea
 (a course somewhat ir∣regular
in nature) without alleadging any authority for the proof of so
improbable a passage.






Aleth.


Excellent Authors avouch the same.
 
Tacitus,
 amongst others,
tells us of this River, 
Unum, atque alterum lacum integer perfluit, tertio 
etinetur;
One, and another lake (viz.
 the waters of 
Merom,
 and 
Galilean-sea) it runneth
through entire, but is stopped in the third;
 namely, in 
Asphaltite-lake,
 or 
Dead-sea.

More full is the testimony of 
Philostorgius,
 and deserveth our serious
perusall thereof. Who speaking of this River, 
, 
Which
 (saith
he) 
passeth through the lake of Tiberias, cutting it in the middle, and flowing clean
through it in its own proper channell.
 Which 
cutting of the lake,
 implies the entire
continuance of 
Iordans
 water; otherwise, that knife doth not cut the loaf,
but is cut by the loaf, which is broken in the dividing thereof.






Philol.


I wonder you pass over 
Shimron-Meron
 in such silence, which
appears a place of great note, yea, a Royall City in the days of 
Ioshua,

as the 
Coronet
 thereupon doth inform us.






Aleth.


I confess it signed with a 
Coronet,
 and with something more,

a flag of uncertainty,
 having nothing sure of the location thereof, the chiefest
cause that I willingly declined the mention of it. However, we will
scrue our selves into as much certainty of this place, as may be extracted
out of Scripture: and observe, the four first 
wreaths
 of my 
scrue
 are un∣doubtedly,
the fifth and last more then probably true, as followeth.



1 
Shimron-Meron
 was one of the
 Royall Cities, whose King 
Ioshua

destroyed.


2 The same City is elsewhere called plainly
 
Shimron,
 without any
addition.


3 It lay on the northern part of the land, because the King thereof
associated in the northern, and second
 combination of the

Canaanites
 against 
Ioshua.


4 A City named 
Shimron,
 was alloted to the Tribe of
 
Zebulun.


5 Most probably this is the same 
Shimron,
 whose King was destroy∣ed
by 
Ioshua.



This is all, which my best industry could collect out of Scripture, or
good Authors, concerning the situation of this place.








Philol.


What mean you by that third smooty circle, which (as the
Meteor 
Halo
 about the 
Sun
) surroundeth the 
Levites
 City of 
Iockneam?






Aleth.


It signifieth nothing, being a meer aberration of the Graver,
which (now but obscure) will in process of Printing, wholly disap∣pear.
And I could hartily wish, no other faults in our Maps, would be
of longer continuance.






Philol.


You make the 
Galilean-sea
 all along the east boundary of this
Tribe. Whereas I am altogether of the minde of 
Masius,
 that no part
of 
Zebulun
 touched on that sea; with him principally grounding my
opinion on the Scriptures silence, which mentioneth not any contermi∣nating
of this Tribe thereupon. Which might soon have been spoken,
yea surely would not have been omitted, had 
Zebulun
 been so situated.






Aleth.


That 
Zebulun
 bordered on this sea, may cleerly be demonstra∣ted;
first from 
Iacobs
 prophecy, that he should dwell 
 
At the
haven of the Seas. Seas
 in the plurall, pointing at his position betwixt the

Mediterranean,
 and 
Galilean
 seas, the west and east bounds of his possessi∣on.
Now lest any should seek to wave these words by an 
Enallage in
Number
 (a figure, we confess, frequent in Hebrew) 
Zebuluns
 bounding
on the 
Galilean-sea,
 is unfallibly collected out of the
 
Gospell,
 where
Christ is said to dwell in 
Capernaum which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of
Z
bulun, and Naphtali.






Philol.


Christ
 his feeding of 
five thousand,
 with 
five loaves,
 and 
two fishes,

is misplaced in your Map, as which ought to be set on the 
east side
 of the

Sea of Galilce.






Aleth.


Learned men are much perplexed about the position of this
miracle. A miracle, so remarkable in it self, that of all the passages be∣twixt
Christs 
conception,
 and the introduction to his 
passion,
 this onely,
and the 
descent of the Dove
 at his 
baptisme
 are recorded in 
all four Evangelists.

Yet some difficulty appears in the particular place thereof.
 
Luke
 term∣eth
it the 
desert of Beth
aida;
 but Saint 
Iohn
 who wrote the last, (there∣fore
supplying the omissions, and explaining the doubts in other 
Go∣spells
)
assigneth the particular place to be 
near Tiberias,
 both being Cities
on the west side of the sea, so that north of 
Tiberias,
 betwixt it
 and 
Beth∣saida,

(in a 
desert
 named from the latter, because leading to it) this mi∣racle
is properly placed.






Philol.


But immediately at the ending thereof, the Disciples are said
to sail 
,
 
unto the other side unto Bethsaida,
 or as Saint

Iohn
 says, 
towards
 
Capernaum
 (both these being Cities not far asunder.)
Wherefore, if they crossed over the 
Sea
 to go to 
Bethsaida,
 they were not
already on the same side thereof when the miracle was wrought, and by
consequence were then on the other [
the eastern
] side of the 
Sea.






Aleth.


By 
, is meant the 
opposite shoar, on the same side of the Sea,
 but
so that it was over a 
reach,
 or 
bay
 which they crossed therein, sailing (not
athwart the breadth of the Sea from west to east, but) almost foreright


the length of the lake, from a place near 
Tiberias
 to the land of
 
Gennesa∣ret,

on the north end of the lake, betwixt 
Bethsaida
 and 
Capernium.
 Thus,
such who on the 
Severn Sea
 sail from 
Bristoll
 to 
Barstable,
 may be said in
some sense to 
cross the water,
 as well as those that saile from 
Barstable
 to

Cardif
e.
 And thus, in placing this miracle we have not onely followed
the judgment of
 worthy 
Calvin,
 but also the eyes of
 
Biddulph
 a modern
traveller, who beheld the place.








CHAP. VIII. Objections against Issachar answered.




Philol.


WHat vast mountains have you made those of 
Gilboa
 to
be? the highest of them four miles perpendicular: Sure∣ly
the battell betwixt 
Saul,
 and the 
Philistines
 could scarce be fought on
such ascents. Yea, 
David
 might well have spared his wish,
 
Let there be
no dew, neither let there be rain upon you,
 whose tops, (as you have exalted
them) may be presumed higher then the clouds themselves.






Aleth.


I confess them to be of the largest size, store of room and want
of other matter to fill it, gave the occasion to their greater growth.
Which fault is amended in the following Map of 
Manasseh,
 where be∣hold
them reduced to a more moderate proportion, less then many of
the mountains in 
Wales.






Philol.


How comes a parcell of mount 
Ephraim
 to straggle into the
Map of 
Issachar?
 It being proper for those mountains to be confined to
their own Tribe of 
Ephraim,
 whence they fetcht their denomination.






Aleth.


I may say the Tribe of 
Ephraim
 had the 
Preemption,
 but not the

Monopoly
 of them. I mean his turn was first served, and he had the
best and most of those mountains in his possession, whence they deser∣vedly
took their name. Yet so, that some part of mount 
Ephraim
 ranged
south ward into the Tribe of 
Benjamin,
 (as mount
 
Zemaraim
) and some
branched northward into 
Issachar,
 as 
Shamir in mount
 
Ephraim;
 certainly
in this Tribe,
 because 
Tola
 a man of 
Issachar
 was buried therein.






Philol.


It followeth not, because he was extracted from this Tribe,
that therefore the place of his buriall was in the same, finding many
mens interments in Scripture, casuall, out of the Tribes of their nativity.
Thus 
Saul
 and 
Ionathan
 being 
Benjamites,
 were notwithstanding buried
in the Tribe of 
Gad,
 at
 
Iabesh Gilead:
 as also 
Ishbosheth
 and 
Abner
 their
Countreymen got graves at
 
Hebron
 in the Tribe of 
Iudah:
 so infirme
is your inference, that 
Shamir
 in 
mount Ephraim
 was in 
Issachar,
 because

Tola
 an 
Issacharite
 was intombed therein.






Aleth.


You instance onely in persons, some forcibly, others treache∣rously
slain, which occasioned their hasty, tumultuary, and extravagant


interment. Remember also that 
Saul
 and 
Ionathan,
 (though interme∣diately
at 
Iabesh Gilead
) were finally intombed in the
 sepulchres of their
Father, in the land of 
Benjamin,
 as we may presume that 
Tola
 his corps
a peaceable Judge (no violent detention, or disturbance appearing to
the contrary) did rest in the possessions of that Tribe; the 
Iews
 gene∣rally
being as ceremonious to be 
buried
 in their own 
land,
 as to be 
mar∣ried

in their own 
linage.








CHAP. IX. Objections against Manasseh on this 
ide Jordan answered.




Philol.


ANd why so much of the Map of 
Issachar
 presented again in

Manasseh? What need this waste,
 and repetition of the same
again?






Aleth.


The squaring of the Map necessarily commanded the repetiti∣on
thereof; nor is it lost labour, because two scattered pieces in 
Issachar

belonged to 
Manasseh.






Philol.


But ô what a medley motley pieced Map have you made of
this half Tribe of 
Manasseth!
 Surely 
Iosephs
 coate consisted not of more

 colours then 
Manasseh (Iosephs sons
) portion is made up of shreds and par∣cels
as you have presented it, marring the in
ireness of this halfe Tribe
with your manifold divisions.






Aleth.


And yet no more then what are warranted by Gods word.
Let none part what he hath put together, nor put together what he hath
parted. I delight not out of wantonness, to make 
smp
 of 
Manasseh's
 por∣tion,
but the Tex
 puts the 
Shears
 into my hand, commanding me to cut
it so: because 
Manasseh
 had
 three Countreys in 
Issachar
 and 
Asher:

That is, surrounded with them, which necessitates the cantoning of this
halfe Tribe into such dis-jointed parcels.






Philol.


You make a piece of 
Asher,
 parted from the main body thereof,
to confine on 
Manasseh,
 whilest 
Bonfrerius
 finds a fitter expedient by cut∣ting
off the west ends of 
Zebulun
 and 
Issachar
 from the 
Mediterranean,
 and
continuing 
Asher
 along the sea side to 
Manasseh,
 so preserving 
Asher
 intire
thereby.






Aleth.


His 
Expedient
 raiseth more difficulties then it allaieth; as di∣rectly
opposite to 
Scripture, Reason,
 and the generall consent of 
Writers,
 as
formerly hath been largely proved in our Objections against 
Zebulun.

Better it is therefore to admit a parcell of 
Asher
 separated from the main
of the Tribe (Instances in English 
Counties
 being frequent in this case)
then by 
Bonfrerius
 his shift, to allow Truth parted from 
Iacobs
 pro∣phecy,
which inevitably followes, if 
Zebulun
 be made 
Land
locked,

and cut off from bounding on the sea.








Philol.


Indeed you put 
Manasseh's
 separate Countreys within 
Issachar,

but not within 
Asher,
 not invironed there with, but onely joining thereto,
whereas the Text saith equally,
 
And Manasseh had in Issachar and Asher
 &c.






Aleth.


The main body of 
Issachar
 confining on 
Manasseh
 afforded us
conveniency to insert such Countreys therein. But 
Asher
 his part being
in it self but a small dis-jointed portion, is not so capable of surrounding
a Countrey within it, seeing such a 
parcell
 within a 
parcell
 would ap∣pear
so diminutive a subdivision as almost inconsiderable. Besides, the
preposition 
 rendred 
In
 in the Text, may sometimes be satisfied with sig∣nifying

ad,
 or 
juxta,
 nigh, or by, that is, a bare proximity, apposition,
and contiguousnes of a thing. In which sense 
Manasseh
 had land border∣ing
on this dis-jointed piece of 
Asher.






Philol.


In
 
Ephraim
 you say that 
Iezreel
 was more then twenty miles
from 
Samaria,
 which measured by the scale in your Map are not above
twelve miles asunder.






Aleth.


Let not the 
Typographicall mistake
 of the Printer be accounted the

Topographicall errour
 of the Author; That 
twelve
 should be 
twenty,
 and in
the 
Errata
 is mended accordingly.






Philol.


You might almost as well inscribe this Map the 
Tribe of Levi,

as the 
Half Tribe of Manasseh.
 It was the complaint in time of Popery,
that the 
Church did eate up the Commonwealth;
 every 
third foot
 in the king∣dome
being 
Church-land,
 before the dissolution of 
Abbies.
 You ende∣vour
to reduce 
Palestine
 to the same proportion. It was a pious wish of

Moses,
 
Would God, that all the Lords people were Prophets:
 But a covetous de∣sire
in you to convert so much of the land into the 
Levites
 portion, by ex∣tending
the circular suburbs of their Cities to six miles Diameter;
whereas Authours contract them, within less then halfe that compass,
yet observing the true dimension of the Cubit therein.






Aleth.


For number such Cities are no moe then the Scripture assigneth,
though here haply falling thicker then in other Maps. As for the three
thousand Cubits of their extent on all sides, we have in the manner of
the measuring thereof followed the direction of judicious
 M
r
. 
Ainsworth,

(as he the learned 
Rabbi Maimony
) preferring it amongst various exposi∣tions,
as most naturall to the Text. Now let none wonder that we
make a thousand Cubits adequate to a thousand paces, or on English
mile. For, although lesser Cubits were used by the 
Iews,
 about their
vessels, and buildings; yet their 
Geometricall Cubit
 (generally employed
for their better expedition, because largest, in their surveying of land)
contained 
six
 
common Cubits;
 and Rabbi
 
Kimhi
 expresly saith that a
thousand 
Emoth,
 or Cubits make a mile. Besides, consider I pray, these
three thousand Cubits were to be measured from the wall of the City,
the flexures and bendings whereof, produced the parallel bendings in
the bounds of the 
Levites
 suburbes. But because we cannot be instructed
in what from the line of their walls ranged about, we begin our mea∣sure


from the midst of the City, and therefore 
 bound to make their
lands amends with the largeness of the C
ibts, because beginning our
mensuration to their disadvantage, from the 
n
er of the City, in s
ead
of the [unknown] circumf
ce thereof.






Philol.


I am not satisfied in the situation of 
,
 that it was seated
in this half Tribe of 
Manass
h.






Aleth.


It is seated according to 
Adrichomi
s,
 and the judgment of most
other
 Authors. But if I might interpose mine own opinion, I conceive
it many miles nearer unto 
Ierusalem
 in the Tribe of 
Ephraim,
 rather nigh
then on the sea, in the road betwixt 
Ierusalem,
 and 
Cesarea,
 some thirty
miles from the former; whither I shall remove the same, when my
opinion herein shall be countenanced with the approbation of others.
My reason that 
Antipatris
 could not be so far northward, (full sixty miles
as they make it from 
Ierusalem
) is, because the
 
ootmen
 sent to attend
Saint 
Paul
 marched thither from 
Ierusalem
 in one night. Now, although
their suspicion of the 
Iews
 pursuing them to rescue Saint 
Paul,
 might
quicken their pace, yet
 
foot-souldiers
 could not be 
foot-posts,
 it being im∣possible
for spearmen to go so far, in so short a time, betwixt the 
third
hour
 [nine a clock at night] and the next morning.








CHAP. X. Objections against Ephraim answered.




Philol.


YOu make a strange 
desultory
 Description of the bounds of this
Tribe, va
lting over from length to breadth in such a fashion
as is hard to be understood, and worse to be applied to the letter of the

 Text.






Al
th.


Wise 
Agur
 confessed he knew not 
the
 
way of an Eagle in the aire,

whose flight therein 
 not to be traced, leaving no visible perforation
behinde it, partly through the swiftness of his motion, partly through
the subtileness of the aire presently closing up the passage. So short and
concise is the 
Holy Spirit
 in bounding the children of 
Ioseph,
 and so long
since hath time taken all impression of many limitary obscure places
there mentioned, that exactness herein, by the confession of the
 best
Authors, is not to be attained. But herein we have followed the directi∣on
of the learned 
Bonfrerius,
 save that we have not contracted the east of

Ephrain
 to wards 
Iordan
 into so narrow a point, but bounded it broader,
to make it a degree the better with the descriptions of other Authors.






Philol.


You make 
Sechem
 in this Tribe, full seventy miles from 
He∣bron

in the Tribe of 
Iudah.
 Me thinks they should be much nearer seeing

Iacob
 sent 
Ioseph
 from
 
Hebr
n
 to 
Sechem
 to give a visite to his brethren.
Now how could his tender love adventure his darling child alone so
tedious and dangerous a journey? Surely the distance was far less then
you make it.








.








Philol.


Rama
 in this Tribe, doubtlesly was a City of the 
Levites
 as
doth appear by 
Elkanah
 and 
Samuel
 their constant habitation there, both
of then 
Levites.
 Why therefore is it not surrounded in your Map with
a double circle, like other Cities of the saine qualification?






Aleth.


I acknowledge 
Ra
a
 for the reasons by you alledged, proba∣bly
pertaining to the 
Levites,
 but have omitted the double incircling
thereof, because I finde it not amongst the four Cities given the 
Levites

in 
Ep
raim,
 nor the forty
 eight assigned to them in the whole kingdome.






Philol.


Was it not then usurpation in the 
Levites
 to inhabite a City
which by God was never granted unto them?






Aleth.


Under favour I conceive, though the 
Levites
 must have four,
they might have moe Cities in 
Ephrain,
 or elsewhere, if the charity of
well disposed people was pleased to bestow them. Thus, beside the
three Cities 
for Refuge
 west of 
Iordan
 the 
Israelites
 were bound, 
if God did
inlarge their
 
coasts,
 to adde three more for the same service. By which
analogy it may be collected, that the 
Ephraimites
 in gratitude to God,
who gave them more intire possession of their portion then any other
Tribe in 
Ioshua's
 division (nothing out 
ezer,
 a 
Levites
 City being de∣tained
from them by the 
Can
anites
) might give this 
Ra
a
 as a gratuity
to the 
Levites.
 Besides, the suburbs and lands of the 
Levites
 reached from
th
 walls of the Cities three thousand Cubits round about, with in
which space they might erect what buildings they please, being therein
(without incroaching on any other Tribe) resident on their proper in∣heritance.

Rama
 therefore might be built within that circumference, and
by the proportion of miles we collect it to stand within the circuit of

Gezer,
 so that though they could not get 
Gezer
 it self, they might gain and
build 
Rama
 within the compass thereof for their habita
ion. However,
we define nothing positively, much less impose it on the beliefe of
others. Clipt money is worth as much as it weighs, though it will not
pass for what it was coined; and conjectures, though they will not goe
for certain truths, deserve to finde as much acceptance, as they bring
probability with them.






Philol.


Have you nothing more to observe concerning the blessings,
and 
 pronounced on mount 
Ebal
 and 
Gerizim






Aleth.


I conceive on 
second thoughts,
 that the Prie
ts with the 
A
ke

stood in the valley betwixt the two hils (whilest the whole body of the
ordinary
 
Levites
 were on the mount of 
Gerizi
) whose station in the


half way betwixt both, when they pronounced the blessings and the
cursings, facilitated the conveyance of the sound on both sides, as appear∣eth
on the serious
 comparing of the Scripture.






Philol.


Tiphsah
 is made by you a City in this Tribe. But, if it were si∣tuate
herein, very short were the dominions of 
Solomon
 even in the very
height of his greatness, who then reigned 
on this side of the river from


 
T
phsah even to Azza,
 or 
Gaza,
 in the Tribe of 
Simeon,
 not fully an hun∣dred
miles, as appears by your Scale in the generall Description of the
land.






Aleth.


Tiphsah
 there mentioned being the eastern boundary of 
Solomons

Empire (from our
 
Tiphsah
 where cruell 
Menahem
 began his reign) was
near a thousand miles north-east on the river 
Euphrates,
 probably the same
with the City 
Tharsacus,
 whereof 
Ptole
y, Strabo,
 and 
Stephanus
 take spe∣ciall
notice.






Philol.


Have you any 
miraculous faith,
 who so easily have removed the

mountain of Phinehas
 (wherein 
Eleazar
 was buried) from the north of
this Map, within the suburbs of 
Bethhoron
 a 
Levites
 City, to the south
thereof near 
Shiloh,
 where in your Map generall the same is presented?






Aleth.


On better consideration I see no necessity, that 
his mountain

should be brought within the bounds of any 
Leviticall
 City. 
Phinehas

was an 
extraordinary
 person, and therefore his land might be 
extraordinary

in the location thereof. This his portion was no part of the 
Levites
 pa∣trimony
in their forty eight Cities given them by God, but seems rather
the 
s
perpondium
 of the peoples
 bounty cast into the balance, as an ho∣nourable
augmentation in reward of his
 eminent desert. I conceive
therefore it lay in 
Mount Ephraim,
 near 
Shilob,
 where the 
Tabernacle
 was
set up, bestowed upon him thereabouts, for his more convenient at∣tending
of Gods service therein.








CHAP. XI. Objections against Dan answered.




Philol.


YOu positively affirme that the land of 
Dan
 belonged primi∣tively
to 
Iudah,
 yet produce no Scripture for the proof there∣of.
We beleeve the same of 
Simeon,
 the
 Text affirming that 
their inheri∣tance
was within the inheritance of Iudah,
 but no evidence appears of such de∣rivation
of 
Dans
 possession originally from 
Iudah.






Aleth.


The same is infallibly collected from Scripture, because the
Cities of 
Eshtaol,
 
Zoreah,
 
Timnah,
 
Ekron
 were first bestowed on 
Iudah,

and
 afterwards we finde the same places, (with the Countrey there∣abouts
by necessary consequence) conferred upon 
Dan's
 posterity for
their portion.






Philol.


Such an alteration seems utterly inconsistent with divine im∣mutab
lity,



with whom is no 
, nor shadow of
 
changing. To give a
thing and take a thing
 is unproportionable with his proceedings, whose

Gifts
 are pronounced by the Apostle to be 
,
 
without Repen∣tance.






Aleth.


Indeed such gifts as amount to the notion of 
 are unca∣pable
of alteration, to which his other grants are subject. Besides, God
never so passed away that land but he still reserved it as his own 
Demesnes.
For the land
 (saith he) 
is mine;
 not 
was,
 but 
is,
 even after the 
Israelite,
 had
long possessed the same. 
Is it not lawfull for him to doe as he will with his
own,
 and to change at pleasure what 
tenants
 to rent, or rather what 
Bailifes

to occupy his own ground?






Philol.


The faces of the Men which bear the 
great bunch of grapes,
 are
set the wrong way. For being to goe south-east to 
Kadesh-
arnea,
 they
look full west to the 
Mediterranean sea.






Aleth.


You put me in minde of a man, who being sent for to pass
his verdict on a 
Picture,
 (how like it was to the person whom it was to
resemble) fell a finding fault with the 
frame
 thereof (not the 
Limners
 but
the 
Ioiners
 work) that the same was not handsomely fashioned. In stead
of giving your judgment on the Map, (how truely it is drawn to re∣present
the Tribe) you cavill at the 
History
properties
 therein, the act of the

raver,
 not 
Geographer.
 Yet know Sir when I checkt the
 
Graver
 for the
same, he answered me that it was proper for 
Spies,
 (like Water-men and
Rope-makers) for surety sake 
to look one way and work another.








CHAP. XII. Objections against Simeon answered.




Philol.


VVHy both an 
Asteriske
 and 
flag of uncertainty
 over 
Sheba?

For, though unassured of the exact position thereof,
the Text ascertaineth us, that it was a reall City in 
Simeon,
 
Beer-sheba,
and Sheba, and Moladah
 &c.






Aleth.


I am not satisfied that 
Sheba
 was a distinct City by it self, but
rather conceive it the same with 
Beer-sheba.
 Because,



1 They are both accounted the same
 when originally denomi∣nated.


2 
Sheba
 is omitted in
 
Chronicles
 where other 
Simeonite
 Cities are
summ'd up) as the same with 
Beer sheba.


3 
Simeon
 had but
 
thirteen
 Cities, which make 
fourteen
 if 
Sheba
 be ac∣counted
a distinct City by it self.



The premisses considered, 
Sheba
 appears the same with 
Beer-sheba
 (as

 
Salem
 with 
Ierusalem
) commonly so called for brevity sake.






Philol.


But then how doe you answer the Text, which expresly maketh

Sheba
 a distinct City, 
Beer-sheba, and Sheba, and Moladah
 &c?








Aleth.


Proteus
 appeared not in more shapes, then the 
Particle
 (here
rendred 
and
) hath severall significations, for though chiefly it is 
copulative,

other whiles it is 
causall, collective, adversative, exegeticall, redditive,
 and 
dis∣junctive,

as
 
Bonfrerius
 readeth it here, 
Beer-sheba, or Sheba, and Moladah

&c.






Philol.


You say that 
Simeon was
 
surrounded on all sides with Iudah,
 where∣as
in your Map, the northern side thereof, is all along fairly flanked
with the Tribe of 
Don.






Aleth.


You may remember (what we so lately proved) that 
Dan's

portion primitively pertained to 
Iudah,
 and was a canton cut out thereof.
In which sense according to Scripture, 
Simeons
 inheritance was
 
within
the children of Iudah's,
 and originally encompassed therewith.






Philol.


Why call you this Tribe
 
a jagged remnant,
 being as 
whole a cloth

as the rest, and (though not so great) as entire as the other Tribes? I
am not sensible by this your Map of any notorious 
dispersedness
 of the

Simeonites
 habitations.






Aleth.


Undoubtedly 
Iudah
 his portion made many incisures, and lar∣cinations
into the Tribe of 
Simeon
 hindering the entireness thereof. Par∣ticularly

Askelon
 and
 
Gaza
 first given to, once
 possessed by 
Iudah,

(though regained by the 
Philistines
) were continued and tyed by some
narrow 
labell
 of land to the main of 
Iudah,
 at leastwise had a 
Church-path

(as I may terme it) a 
passage to the Temple,
 without going through any
part of 
Simeon.
 But, wanting certain instructions, how to contrive, and
carry on such indented conveyances, and not willing to confine the Rea∣der
to our conjecturall fancies, we have left him to his liberty, presen∣ting

Simeon
 entire, wherein he may frame such incursions of 
Iudah
 as
comply best with his own opinion.






Philol.


You make this Tribe to range some miles south of 
Beer-sheba,

whereas that place passeth currant for the utmost border of the Coun∣trey.
What more common in Scripture, then
 
from. Dan to Beer-sheba,

that is, from the north to the south of the land of 
Canaan?






Aleth.


It was the utmost eminent City, but not absolutely the farthest
place in 
Palestine,
 as neither mentioned amongst the southern boundaries
of the land in generall, 
Numb.
 34. nor with the utmost limits of the Tribe
of 
Iudah, Iosh.
 15. In ordinary discourse we measure 
England
 east and
west 
from Dover to the Mount,
 as the farthest western place of note, though

Cornwall
 stretches seven
 miles beyond it unto the 
lands end.
 So 
Beer-sheba

was the remotest remarkable City of 
Canaan,
 where the 
cloth,
 as I
may say, ended, though the 
list
 thereof reached beyond it to the 
River

of 
Egypt.










CHAP. XIII. Objections against Benjamin answered.




Philol.


VVHy make you 
Nob
 a 
Levite
 City in 
Benjamin,
 within
the suburbs of 
Anathoth?
 Seeing 
Nob
 is neither named
amongst the four Cities bestowed on the 
Levites
 in this Tribe, 
Iosh.
 21. 17.
nor is it any of the eight and forty belonging unto them throughout
the whole Countrey of 
Canaan.






Aleth.


That 
Nob
 was in this Tribe, appears by that ca
alogue of Cities
presented us in
 
Nehemiah,
 which the 
Benjamites
 repossessed after their
return from 
Babylon.
 That it was a 
Levites,
 yea a 
Priests City,
 appears (too
plainly) by the
 
Massacre
 therein on them committed. We confess it
none of the eight and forty originally assigned to the 
Levites.
 Yet how
they in after-ages, were capable of 
supernumerary
 Cities more then in their
first 
Charter,
 and how the 
Mort
main
 of the 
Levites
 (as I may term it)
was enlarged with new foundations, we have lately answered in the
objections of 
Ephraim
, whither we refer you for further satisfaction.






Philol.


You make the sons of 
Saul
 executed on an hill nigh 
Gibeah of
Saul,
 which your judicious
 friend will have hung up before the 
Taber∣nacle
in Gibeon,
 observing therein an exemplary piece of divine justice,
that, 
whereas Saul had ruined the Tabernacle at Nob, his sons were hung up before
the same in Gibeon.






Aleth.


Not to be a 
Plaintise
 against him, but a 
Defendant
 of my self▪ I
conceive him mistaken in confounding 
Gibeah of Saul
 with 
Gibeon,

distinct Cities, as may appear by their severall owners, and actions
therein performed.





GIBEON.


GIBEAH.






An ancient City of the 
Hi∣vites,

whose
 inhabitants de∣ceived
the 
Israelites,
 given to
the Levites, in the Tribe of

Benjamin,
 where the Taber∣nacle
was set up in the time of

Solomon.


A City in 
Benjamin,
 hard by 
I
rusalem,
 distinct
from the
 former, whose inhabitants were meer

Benjamites,
 and by their lust abused the

 Levites Concubine to death, for which their
Tribe was almost extirpated: it was afterwards
called 
Gibeah of Saul
 from his birth and frequent
residence therein.





Now the text expresly saith, that the 
Gibeonites did hang them up unto the Lord
in Gibeah
 
of Saul,
 that is, in 
Sauls
 native place, and Court, where he had
issued out his cruell edicts for the slaughter of the 
Gibeonites.






Philol.


But that expression 
they hanged them in the hill
 
before the Lord,
 im∣ports
the same performed in some religious place, probably in the pro∣spect
or view of the Tabernacle.






Aleth.


Before the Lord
 implies no more, then what in the foregoing
verse was termed
 
unto the Lord,
 that is, in a sacred manner, not out of
private revenge, but in an holy zeal, tendering the parties executed an ob∣lation
to divine justice, and so is interpreted by the Expositors there∣on.








Philol.


In your particular Map of 
Benjamin, Iordan
 runs almost di∣rectly
south, the whole course of whose channell visibly bendeth east∣ward
in your Map generall of 
Palestine.






Aleth.


That generall Map, (though first placed) was last perfected,
wherein we have amended three mistakes, as escaped in our particular
descriptions. One that wherein you instance, another 
 
Re
en
 (for∣merly
forgott
n to be confessed) making that Tribe a little longer from
north to south, then it is represented in our particular description
thereof. My care shall be, God willing, in the second edition,
to conforme those particular Maps, according to these 
rectisi
ations
 in the
generall description.








CHAP. XIV. Objections against Judah answered.




Philol.


WOuld not it affright one to see a dead man walk? And
will not he in like manner be amazed to see the 
Dead-sea

moving? Why have you made the surface of the waters thereof 
wa∣ving,

as if like other seas it were acted with any 
ty
e,
 which all Authors
avouch, and your self confesseth
 to be a 
standing stinking
 lake? Think

not to plead, that such 
waving
 is the impression of the winde there∣upon,
seeing 
Tacitus
 affirmes of this sea, 
Neque
 
vento impellitur,
 it is such
a 
drone,
 it will neither 
goe
 of it self, nor yet be 
driven
 of the winde.






Aleth.


I will not score it on the account of the Graver, that it is onely

lascivia,
 or 
ludicrum coeli,
 the over-activity of his hand: And in such cases the
flourishings of the 
Scrivener
 are no essentiall part of the 
Bond:
 but behold

Mercators,
 and other Authors Maps, and you shall finde more motion
therein, then is here by us expressed. The most melancholy body of
moisture, (especially of so great extent) is necessarily subject to such 
simpe∣ring

in windy weather, as inseparable from the liquidity thereof.






Philol.


Why set you 
Zeboim
 most northernly of all the five Cities in the

Dead-sea,
 in the place where 
Sodome
 is situated in all other descriptions?






Aleth.


The placing of them is not much materiall, whether longwise
all in a 
File
 as M
r
. 
More
 sets them, or in two 
Rankes,
 (two and two)
as they are ordered by
 
Mercator.
 Skuls in a 
charnel-house
 never justle for
the upper place; and as sensless is the contention betwixt these dead
Cities, which shall stand first, whose foundations long since were
doubly destroyed with 
fire
 and 
water.
 But the sole motive of my placing

Zeboim
 most northern of these four Cities, is because I finde
 
the valley of
Zeboim
 in the Tribe
 of 
Benjamin,
 which probably lay near the influx of

Iordan
 into the 
Dead-sea,
 denominated from the vicinity of 
Zeboim
 there∣abouts.






Philol.


The 
Hebrew Orthography
 confutes your conceit. For 
Zeboim
 by


you last alledged is spelled with different letters from the City which
was burnt with fire from heaven.






Aleth.


I confess a threefold variation in the writing of this name,
though all the same in effect,



1 
Gen.
 14. 2. and so also 
Deut.
 29. 23. 


2 1 
Sam.
 13. 18 


3 
Hoseah
 11. 8. 
. 
I shall set thee at Zeboim &c.



Here to mollifie the word, the 
Gutturall
 is either altered, or wholly omit∣ted;
neither amounting to make it a new word: How variously are
the names of the same English towns spoken and spelled; as 
Lester,
Leicester, Legeocester, Legecester,
 yet the same word dressed in severall spel∣lings and pronunciations?






Philol.


Why make you 
Heb
on
 being a noted City of the Priests, and
City of Refuge, different from all the rest, onely with a single circle
about it?






Aleth.


Because the 
fields and villages thereof
 were none of the Priests,
 but
were given to 
Caleb
 the son of 
Iephunneh
 for his possession.






Philol.


If so, then 
Hebron
 ought not to have had any circle at all about it,
being a bare City of the Priests without any suburbs belonging there∣unto.






Aleth.


The Priests in 
Hebron
 had, and had not, suburbs pertaining
thereunto, according to the severall acception of 
suburbs.
 If by them you
onely understand 
aedificia suburbana,
 buildings (though without the City
walls) contiguous thereunto, these (no doubt) belonged to the Priests,
who had
 
Hebron with her suburbs:
 otherwise if you extend them to 
ager
suburbanus,
 the fields surrounding the City, these related to 
Caleb
 as the
proper owner thereof.






Philol.


You might well have afforded conjecturall flags to most of the
Cities in 
Iudah,
 going generally by guess in your placing of them, and
differing from all other authors therein.






Aleth.


The Learned in Anatomy have informed me, that veins are
alike 
in their trunks, but not in their branches;
 so that although the 
great
Channels of bloud
 run alike in all bodies, yet the smaller veines (as is
most visible in their 
diva
ication
 on the 
back of the hand
) disperse them∣selves
diversly, in divers persons: The like is confessed in all Maps of

Iudah,
 wherein the grand Cities, 
Hebron, Debir, Bethlehem &c.
 have their
certain position agreed on by most Authors, whilest their inferiour
places (and no Tribe afforded more obscure Cities but once named in
Scripture) are subject to much variety, according to the fancies of Au∣thors.
Wherein we hope we have observed, as much as might be, these
short, and small directions we finde in Scripture.






Philol.


But you are not constant to your self in the location of those
lesser places, as appears by some diversity of their distances (both
amongst themselves and from 
Ierusalem
) in the particular description of

Iudah,
 and in the generall Map of 
Palestine.








Aleth.


I confess the same; who having discovered some errors in
the particular Map, reformed the same in the Map-generall. Which may
be beheld in this point, as a 
new Edition
 of the former, 
corrected and amen∣ded.

Request I therefore the Reader in such small differences, to rely ra∣ther
on the credit of the Map-generall.






Philol.


You
 once placed 
Hepher
 a royall City in 
Manasseh
 on this side

Iordan,
 which since you have removed into 
Iudah,
 without giving any
account of the alteration.






Aleth.


Some probability perswaded us to our former opinion. Cheif∣ly
because 
Hepher
 is mentioned in 
Ioshua's
 list, next to 
Tapuah;
 which is
known to be in 
Manasseh.
 But since finding also a 
Tapuah
 in 
Iudah,
 and

a land of
 
Hepher
 near 
Sochoh,
 a place also in
 
Iudah,
 it hath staggered our
judgment, and caused us to remove 
Hepher
 into 
Iudah
 with a 
flag
 of uncer∣taintie
thereon; all Authors 
finding an Ignoramus
 for the exact position
thereof.






Philol.


The land of 
Goshen
 is sufficiently known to be in
 
Egypt:
 And
how stragleth of
 
Countrey of Goshen
 into this Tribe?






Aleth.


You know that besides this 
England
 wherein we live, there is
an 
Anglia
 in 
Denmark,
 whence our Ancestors are said to have come;
and there is 
England beyond Wales,
 whither some of our nation removed. Some such occasion (to us unknown) might give the name of 
Goshen
 to
a petty tract of ground in 
Iudah:
 Or else it might be so called from some
assimilation in the fruitfulness thereof. Wonder not at a 
Goshen
 in 
Egypt,

and another in 
Iudah;
 when we finde two
 
Ziphs,
 two
 
Zenoahs,
 two

 
Socohs
 &c. (As two 
Kirbies market-townes
 in 
Westmorland
) within the
compass of this Tribe.






Philol.


Conceive you that any wildernesses wherewith 
Iudah
 aboun∣ded,
were places of any pleasant habitation?






Aleth.


I am confident thereof. For instance, 
Engedi
 though a
 
Wil∣derness,

was so delicious a place,
 that the 
Spouse
 is compared to a cluster
of Camphire in the 
Vineyards of Engedi.
 Besides, it had the conveniency of
Palmtrees, therefore
 in Scripture called 
Hazazon-Tamar, which is Engedi
Tamar,
 being in Hebrew a 
Palme.
 Nor can I omit the testimony of

 
Pliny
 as the best comment herein in Gods word; who speaking of
people living on the west of the 
Dead-sea; amongst these
 (saith he) 
is the town
ENGADDA; Second to Ierusalem in fruitfulness, and WOODS OF
PALME-TREES; but now become another heap of Ashes.






Philol.


I finde indeed a City, and wilderness of 
Maon
 in this Tribe,
but were the dwellers therein, those same 
Maonites,
 which are said 
Iudg.
 10.
12. with the 
Zidonians
 and 
Amalekites
 to have oppressed 
Israel?






Aleth.


O no. I take these tyrant 
Maonites
 to have been a fierce and
forein Nation. Saint 
Hierom, de locis Hebraicis,
 conceives 
Maon
 to be the
Countrey of 
Moab.
 The vulgar Latine translates it 
Canaanites,
 because

Maonites
 signifieth 
inhabitants,
 and the 
Canaanites
 we know were the an∣cient


and originall dwellers in the land) whose Relicks left in the land
contrary to Gods command, were constant thornes in the sides of the

Israelites.
 But I conceive rather with learned 
Cajetan
 on this place, these 
Mao∣nites

were a distinct neighbouring nation, whose certain habitation is
to us unknown.






Philol.


Saul,
 when marching against the 
Amalekites,
 is said 
to have
numbred the people
 (being two hundred and ten thousand, 
in
 
Telaim:

which by the coast of the Countrey seems south in or near 
Iudah.
 Yet no
such place appears in your Map thereof.






Aleth.


The Hebrew word 
 is variously interpreted, the Rab∣bins
render it appellatively 
in Lambes;
 affirming the 
Saul
 did not count
them 
in specie,
 but for more safety or expedition, computed the people
by their 
Paschall Lambes,
 proportioning such a number of men to a
Lambe. Others read it, 
He numbred them as Lambes,
 that is, now grown
meek and quiet, (whereas at the first there were some
 animosities of
the people against him: 
Shall Saul reign over us?
) contentedly submitting
themselves to his command. But I take 
Telaim
 for a true City, and the
same with 
Telem Iosh.
 15. 24. which you may finde in our description.








CHAP. XV. Objections against the Land of Moriah
answered.




Philol.


I Perceive the imperfection of your description by the
omitting of a memorable valley therein, namely the vale of 
Ba∣ca,

mentioned by the Psalmist pronouncing him 
blessed who passing through
the vale of Baca
 
maketh it a Well.
 You in stead of 
passing through,
 pass by this

vale
 unmentioned.






Aleth.


I reserved my observations on this vale for this place. Some
render it appellatively, 
The vale of weeping:
 meaning thereby the 
militant
condition of a Christian in this life, incumbred with constant afflictions.
 If so, this
vale of 
Baca
 is too big to come under my description; 
all the moun∣tains

in the world being but part of this 
valley,
 the extent whereof is ade∣quate
to the whole earth. But if you be pleased to take this vale for a
proper place, I embrace the opinion of learned 
Ainsworth
 on the text, that
this vale of 
Baca,
 or 
Mulberry trees,
 (for so also it signifieth) was near to

Ierusalem;
 out of the tops of which
 trees, God sounded the Alarum to

David
 when he conquered the 
Philistines.










CHAP. XVI. Objections against the City of
Jerusalem answered.




Philol.


VVHat is charged unjustly on Saint 
Paul
 and his compa∣nions,
that they had
 
turned the world upside down,
 may
truly be laid to your charge, you have in your description of 
Ierusalem

tumbled all things 
topsie turvy,
 in the position of the gates thereof; yea 
the
foundations
 of the City, as presented by you, are 
out of course,
 and con∣trary
to the rules of other writers.






Aleth.


Let God be true, and every man a liar.
 In this particular I profess my
self a 
pure Leveller,
 desiring that all humane conceits (though built on most
specious bottomes) may be laid flat and prostrated, if opposing the 
written Word.
 In conformity whereunto, we are bound to dissent from such
Authors (otherwise honouring them for their severall deserts) to ac∣commodate
the Description of the Gates and Towers of 
Ierusalem,
 accor∣ding
to a threefold eminent Directory, which we finde in 
Nehemiah.






Philol.


Give us I pray you an account of them in order.






Aleth.


The first main Scripture direction we are to observe is, the

night survey
 which 
Nehemiah
 took of the walls, (or rather ruines) of 
Ieru∣salem,

described in this manner:
NEHEM. 2. 13, 14, 15.
And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the Dragon
Well, to the Dung port, and viewed the walls of Ierusalem, which were broken
down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. Then went I out to the
gate of the fountain and to the Kings pool, but there was no place for the beast
that was under me to pass. Then went I up in the night by the brook, and
viewed the wall, and turned back and entred by the gate of the valley, and so
returned.


The second is the severall reparations (where the same were required)
done on the Gates and walls of the City by severall persons, in a circular
form, from the 
Sheep-gate
 surrounding the whole City till they returned
to the same place where they began▪ Whose names we have carefully
inscribed on those portions of buildings, upon which their cost and
pains were expended.


The third, but most materiall, (because most declaratory of the me∣thod
of the Gates) is the solemn 
Processions,
 which the people
divided into 
two Quires,
 made round about the walls: each of them
measuring a 
Semi-circle;
 both of them incompassing the whole

circumference
 of 
Ierusalem,
 and at last joining together in the (best meeting
place) the 
Temple of God.


First Quire, Nehem. 12. 31.
One great company went on the right hand,
upon the wall towards the Dung-gate, consisting
of half the Princes of Iudah: and Ezra the
Scribe before them. And at the fountain-gate
which is over against them, they went up by the
staires of the City of David, at the going up of
the wall above the house of David, even unto
the water-gate eastward.
Second Quire, Nehem. 12. 38, 39.
And the other company of them that gave thanks
went over against them,
 and I after them, and the
half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the
Tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall.
And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the
old-gate and above the fish-gate, and the tower of
Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the
sheep-gate; and they stood still in the
 prison-gate.
So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks
in the house of God.

Now I request the Reader with his eye to examine, whether the walls
of 
Ierusalem,
 as designed in our draught, agree not with these directions
of Scripture. To purchase the favour whereof, I pass not for the frowns
of any Authors. 
Omne excelsum cadet,
 down with whatever dare oppose
our embracing of the Text. This we hope for the main▪ will satisfie
any indifferent Reader; otherwise if being as impossible for me in this
short discourse, to meet with the severall exceptions of private fancies; as
for a Geographer in the 
Map-generall
 of a Countrey, to set down the
house of every 
particular person.






Philol.


You set 
Sion
 south of 
Ierusalem,
 clean contrary to the description
of the Psalmist
, 
Beautifull for situation, the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion,
on the Sides of the North the City of the great King.






Aleth.


The place by you alleadged is difficult, much canvassed by
Comments, who fasten upon it two principall interpretations.


1 Sense. Some make this verse a description of 
Sion
 a∣lone,
the latter clause by 
Apposition
 so referring
unto it, that 
Sion
 it self is solely charactered to be
the City 
on the side of the North.


2 Sense. Others make this verse the full description of
all 
Ierusalem,
 consisting of two principall parts,
by the figure of 
Asyndeton
 coupled together. 


1. Sion. 
Beautiful for situation the 
oy
of the whole earth is Mount
Sion.


2. 
Properly
 Jerusalem. 
On the sides of the North
the City of the great
King.



That the latter is the truer interpretation we send the Reader to the vo∣luminous
labours of
 
Villalpandus
 proving the same out of Scripture, 
Io∣sephus,

and other Authors. Besides (though time and casualty hath made
many alterations on 
Ierusalem,
 yet) what 
Peter
 in his time said of 
Davids

sepulcher, even in our age true of mount 
Sion,
 
it is with us unto this day,

standing still full south of 
Ierusalem,
 as Travellers doe affirme, no doubt
in the ancient place and posture thereof. For, although 
Ioseph
 could re∣move
the 
Egyptians
 from
 
one end of the borders of the land, unto the other end
thereof;
 yet mountains are too firmly fastned to be transplanted from
their naturall location.






Philol.


You doe commit what you condemn in 
Adrichomius,
 taxing

 him for fashioning the streets of 
Ierusalem
 after his own fancy; assu∣ming
the same liberty to your self in conjecturall ranging them with∣out
warrant from Gods word.






Aleth.


Reason dictates what we have done herein. For 
Gates
 being
made for entrance, probably the streets from them stretched forth-right,


as we have de
igned them. Those 
Insulae,
 or 
Quadrants of buildings,
 are no∣thing
else but the necessary product of the decussation and thwarting
of such direct streets where they cross one another. It is impossible that
in describing 
Ierusalem
 we should doe what 
Saul
 in another case desired
of the 
Ziphites,
 
See therefore and take notice of all the lurking places, and come yee
again with the certainty;
 onely such generalls in likelyhood may be presu∣med,
and the rest is left to every mans free conception.






Philol.


You have forgotten the 
Porta fictilis
 or 
Potters-gate,
 which

 
Villalpandus
 solemnly sets up on the east of the City, building on a
place alleadged out of the Prophet 
Ieremy.






Aleth.


His 
Porta fictilis,
 is rather 
fictitia
 and so brittle a gate that it is
broken with perusing the text by him cited, for the proof thereof.
 
Thus
saith the Lord, goe and get a potters earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the
people and of the ancients of the Priests, and goe forth unto the valley of the son of
Hinnom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I
shall tell thee.
 See here (whatever may be in the vulgar Latine) no sherd
of a 
Potters-gate,
 though we confess a 
Potters
 
field
 nigh the City; but,
thence it cannot be collected that there was also a gate of that name, no
more then if followes, because of 
Smithfield,
 there must be 
Smith-gate
 in

London.






Philol.


You affirm
 that we 
meet with no gate at all in Sion,
 flatly contra∣ry
to the words of 
David,
 
The Lord loveth the gates of Sion more then all the
dwellings of Icoab.






Aleth.


I say again, that because of the precipice of the place, 
Sion
 had
no out-gates, but had those which led into 
Ierusalem
 which might be
meant by the Psalmist. But to speake plainly, 
Gates of Sion
 are not there
to be taken literally, being put for the 
assemblies of the people
 at Gods publick
worship; especially, whilest the Ark was in 
Davids
 time fixed in 
Zion.








CHAP. XVIII. Objections against the Courts of Solomons Temple answered.






Philol.


IN your description of the Courts of 
Solomons Temple,
 I finde one∣ly
four gates to the cardinall windes, but neither 
Parbar
 nor

Asuppim Gate,
 though both of them eminently mentioned
 in the Bible.






Aleth.


I must confess my self utterly unsatisfied in the position of these
places, whether or no they were in the first two Courts, as built by 
So∣lomon,

or added in after ages, when the 
new
 or 
third Court
 was added to

Solomons
 foundation: which latter I am most inclined to beleeve. For
perusing the date of the 
first book of Chronicles,
 I finde it written long after
the 
Iews
 return from the captivity of 
Babylon,
 as appears by reckoning up
the grand-children of
 
Zorobabel,
 and therefore I suspend the describing
of them till further information.








Philol.


At the entrance of the 
House of the Lord,
 you
 make 
horses,
 but
omit the 
Chariots
 of the 
Sun,
 both equally mentioned in
 Scripture, and
destroyed by 
Iosiah.
 Besides, you make them artificiall statues, which (no
doubt) were naturall 
horses,
 sent out with riders every morning in a

superstitious frolick,
 to give a 
welcome,
 or 
visit
 to the dawning-day, and to
salute the 
Sun
 in the first arising thereof.






Aleth.


Chariots must be supposed there, though not expressed for
lack of room. Sure they were no reall horses, which the [idolatrous]

Kings of Israel
 had given to the
 
Sun.
 For (except thereby be meant a
successive breed, or race) such horses must be extremely old at this refor∣mation,
after the
 
eighteenth year of Iosia
,
 probably set up by 
Ahaz
 sixty
years since. Besides, it is improbable, that living horses were kept so
close to the Temple, and that 
noisome stables
 should be so near 
Gods house,

generally set at some distance from mens dwellings. However, I had
rather subscribe, then ingage in a controversie not worth the conten∣ding for.






Philol.


You
 mention onely one 
Table of shew-bread,
 whereas 
David

made preparation for the
 
Tables
 thereof. And lest so plain a place of
Scripture should be avoided, by the frequent figure of 
Enallage, Solomon
 is
expresly said to have made
 
ten Tables and placed them in the Temple,
 and it is added not long after, 
whereon the
 
shew-bread was set.






Aleth.


I am confident, there was but one 
principall Table
 for the presen∣tation
of 
shew-bread,
 whereon, by Gods appointment, the 
twelve
 
Cakes

were set in two rowes, according to the number of the twelve Tribes of

Israel.
 Now, if there were 
ten Tables
 provided for that purpose, the 
twelve
Cakes
 could not be equally set upon them without a 
fraction.
 I conceive
therefore the 
other nine,
 onely as 
side-cupboards,
 or 
Livery tables
 ministeriall
to that principall one, as whereupon the 
shew-bread elect
 was set before
the consecration thereof, and whereon the 
old shew-bread
 removed for
some time, might be placed, when 
new
 was substituted in the room
thereof.






Philol.


To proceed to the Altar. I approve your
 answer taken from
the 
Celestiall fire
 thereupon, as satisfactory in relation to the 
Tabernacle,
 and

Solomons Temple,
 that so many sacrifices were so suddenly consumed
without any noisomeness. But, the difficulty still remains as touching
the second Temple: where, by generall confession (in default of 
hea∣venly
)
the Priests were fain to make use of common, and ordinary fire.






Aleth.


Although I beleeve not in full latitude, what the 
Iewish Rabbins

doe affirme; That the 
Pillar of smoak
 which ascended from the sacrifice,
curled onely upwards in direct wreaths to heaven, without any scatter∣ing,
or shedding if self abroad; yet for the main, we may be confident,
it was no whit offensive to the Priests, or people thereabouts. This we
impute to the providence of God, passing an 
Act of indemnity,
 that none
should be impaired, either in health or wealth, by the performance of


any service according to his appointment. And, as the land of the 
Iews

was secured from forein invasion
 
during the appearing of all the males thrice
a year
 at 
Ierusalem:
 so the same goodness of God ordered, that his people
should sustain no damage or detriment, either in their purses, or per∣sons,
whilest busied in his worship: the main reason that no infection
did arise, no smoak, nor ill savor sented from the fat, offall, and excre∣ments
of so many sacrifices offered in so short a time, and small a
compass.






Philol.


You say something for the avoiding of noisomeness, but no∣thing
in answer, that that common fire should so quickly devour so
many sacrifices, though, I confess the offerings in the second Temple,
nothing so numerous as those in 
Solomons.






Aleth.


We must totally ascribe this to the 
work of the Lord,
 who though
not granting this second 
Temple
 the honour and use of 
Celestiall fire
 (al∣lowed
to the former) yet, in approbation of his own ordinance, indu∣ed
common 
fire
 with more then common activity. As, often in extre∣mities,
when miracles are denied, 
ordinary
 means are blessed with 
extra∣ordinary

efficacy in their operation.








CHAP. XIX. Objections against Zorobabels Temple rebuilt by Herod.




Philol.


I Forbear from objecting any thing against this Map of the
Temple, seeing, by your confession, it is none of your own
designing, but borrowed from 
Ludovicus Capellus.
 Onely let me tell you,
that I have seen a draught of the same Temple, as in fashion much un∣like
it, so in exactness far above it. I mean the same which 
Constantine L'
Empereur
 hath set forth out of 
Middoth,
 or the 
Rabbinicall
 book of 
Solomons

building.






Aleth.


I confess my self to give little credit to 
Rabbinicall
 relations
therein, and think the worse of the writings of all 
Rabbins,
 for their own
thinking so well thereof, comparing them with, yea preferring them be∣fore
Scripture it self. Such
 passages (which for me shall goe 
unenglished
)
being found frequent therein.
 
In illis qui operam dant lectioni Biblicae, virtus
aliqua est, aut potiùs nulla; at qui traditioni, virtus est, propter quam accipitur praemi∣um.
Egredienti
 
è studio Talmudico ad studium Biblicum, non erit pax.
 
Scito verba
Scribarum amabiliora esse verbis Prophetarum.
 Justly therefore did Christ com∣plain
of thē,
 
Making the word of God of none effect through your traditiōs which ye
have delivered.
 And, although I am not of the mind of
 
Villalpandus,
 who ad∣viseth
such as would read the 
Rabbins
 without danger, first to fense them∣selves
with the 
signe of the Cross,
 and then whilest reading their books,
often to repeat our Saviours word, 
You are of your father the
 
Devill;
 yet


I conceive 
Epicharmus
 his counsell very usefull herein, 
, 
Re∣member
thou not to beleeve,
 their books (I mean in many passages therein)
being 
the Leaven of the Scribes and Pharisees,
 whereof Christ forewarneth
us to beware.






Philol.


Grant them unsound in 
points of faith,
 they may be true in 
mat∣ters
of fact.
 And though we must zealously reject their doctrinall positi∣ons,
we may safely embrace their historicall relations; especially con∣cerning
the contrivance of the second Temple extant in their age.






Aleth.


As touching this second Temple, the works of the 
Rabbins
 now
extant can give us no true intelligence thereof. The 
Iews
 once said to our
Saviour
, 
Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
 taxing
him for pretending to more antiquity, then his age could extend unto.
Though this was but a cavill at Christ, the same may justly be charged
on the 
Rabbins,
 that the oldest of them extant at this day, (all of them wri∣ting
since 
Ann. Dom.
 100. in 
Trajans
 time) are too late and modern to
give us any infallible information of the second Temple, as which their
eyes did never behold. Whilest 
Iosephus
 (out of whose instructions

Capellus
 his description was lately taken) was an eye-witness thereof.






Philol.


Allow their personall experience too short to reach the
Temple, their reports proceed on ancient records, declaring, 
as what was
done in their days, so in the old time before them.






Aleth.


So many and prodigious are the
 monstrosities by them deli∣vered, that it is hard to discern their 
Lampreys
 from their 
Snakes;
 and the
very truths among them are rendered suspicious, because mixed with
so many falshoods: 
Who, because they received not the truth
 [Christ him∣self]

for this cause God hath sent them strong
 
delusions that they should beleeve a lye.






Philol.


Grant the 
Rabbins
 generally guilty hereof, yet 
Rabbi Iudah
 may
be credited, living about 
Trajans
 time, not much above thirty years after
the destruction of the Temple. One commonly styled the 
Prince,
 and
the 
Holy,
 conceived by his Countreymen next to 
Moses
 in knowledge
and piety. Wherefore that new description of the Temple I so lately
commended, deserves beleefe, coming from the pen of this 
Rabbi Iudah,
 as
far exceeding other 
Rabbins,
 as the 
Patriarch Iudah
 excelled other Tribes.






Aleth.


Your so much admired 
Rabbi Iudah
 was swolne with Pharisai∣call
hypocrisie, as high as any other. Witness his dying words, breathing
out his soul with an expression to this effect,
 
Lord of the world, it is mani∣fest
and known unto thee, that I have laboured in thy law with my ten fingers, and
have not received any gain, no not with so much as the least finger.
 Justly therefore
may we be jealous of this water coming from such a fountain.






Philol.


Well, to wave the description of this 
Rabbin,
 and to give you
onely an occasion to enlarge your self, I desire farther information both
in this draught of 
Capellus,
 and also in your own written description of

Zorobabel-Herods Temple.
 For the first, I wonder you have omitted the

Bridge from mount Olivet to the Temple,
 mentioned in 
Middoth.








Aleth.


We finde indeed such a 
Bridge
 (others call it a 
Caus-way
) in 
Mid∣doth

built on purpose from 
mount Olivet
 to the 
mountain of the house,
 whereon
the Temple was built. But oh! how long must that 
Bridge
 be? Above a
mile in the direct extent thereof. How many, but especially how high
must the arches therein be, to stride over so vast a concavity? What need
of so expensive a structure, seeing an ordinary plank would serve for
a bridge over 
Kedron?
 which in sommer time was 
all bridge
 it selfe. How
came 
Iosephus
 (one neither blinde to see, nor dumb to tell of beautifull
buildings for the honour of his nation) to take no notice hereof? In∣deed
the high Priests amongst the 
Romans,
 anciently had an inspection
over the making and mending of bridges, thence called 
Pontifices:
 but he
deserved to be 
Pontifex Maximus
 amongst the 
Iews,
 who erected this sum∣ptuous
bridge, on which may beliefe dare not walk with confidence, for
fear of falling, and therefore I conclude it well omitted by 
Capellus.






Philol.


I am not satisfied in the reasons you give why 
Solomons Porch

was so called.






Aleth.


Concerning the name whereof,
 let me adde this (to what
formerly we have
 written on this subject) that some conceive it so
called, not because 
Solomon
 ever built it, but because in after ages erected
by 
Herod,
 it did approximate, or come the nearest in state and magnifi∣cence
to that of 
Solomons
 first founding. Thus 
Manna
 is termed
 
Angels food,

not because they ever eat thereof, but had they any intention to feed
thereon, better dainties could not be desired by them, or afforded to them:
as this 
Solomons
 porch (at leastwise in the apprehension of the builders
thereof, well conceited of their own workmanship) was so called, be∣cause
as brave, and beautifull, as if 
Solomon
 himself with all his wealth,
and glory, had been the erectour thereof?






Philol.


I conceive some carnall reason for the buyers and sellers of

Sheep and Oxen
 in the Temple, (driven out by our Saviour) because men,
to save the tedious driving of them up 
in kinde,
 brought 
flocks and heards

up in their 
purses
 to 
Ierusalem,
 (money wherewith there they bought
them) but what use was there of 
money-changers
 in the 
Temple?






Aleth.


 Besides their changing of strangers gold into silver, 
for less pay∣ments

at their 
coming hither;
 silver into gold for the 
lighter portage,
 at their
departure hence; under favour I conceive, they fitted people coming hither
with 
Shekels,
 for their religious service. True it is, the 
Roman
 coins
were onely currant in common and civill paiments (as appears by
Christs question and the 
Iews
 answer, 
Whose image and superscription is this?
and they said, Cesars
) but probably 
Shekels
 were used in sacred paiments,
the 
Romans
 permitting the 
Iews
 the free enjoyment of their Religion, in
things not destructive to their civill government. Now, seeing the 
Iews

were enjoined by Gods Law, to tender unto him 
Shekels
 of the 
Sanctuary,

not onely in valuation, but in 
Specie
 (especially in the case of
 vowes,
paying moe or few according to the age, or sex of the person) it is likely


that the 
money-changers
 here furnished the aforesaid 
Votaries
 with 
Shekels,

and other pieces thereof, in exchange for their 
Roman
 moneys. But here∣in
such 
Brokers
 so improved themselves on the present necessities of
some, and ignorance of others, that they much defrauded people with
their contracts, therefore termed by our Saviour a
 
Den of theeves.






Philol.


Why was the outward Court in the Temple called the 
Court
of women?






Aleth.


 Not, that they alone were permitted to be there; but because
they were not suffered, 
unless on speciall occasions,
 to goe any farther. Thus

 
Iosephus
 calls it 
, 
the proper place for wo∣men
to worship in;
 but elsewhere expounds himself,
 
,

farther then this the Temple was unaccessible to women;

so that this Court was proper for, but not peculiar unto the weaker sexe
for their staying therein.






Philol.


Seeing that Court was signally so called from 
Women,
 doe you
conceive as many women as men repaired to Gods publick service in

Ierusalem?






Aleth.


O no! All males were enjoined to appear
 thrice a year (and
that not empty handed) before the Lord in the 
Temple;
 whilest the
same was not required of women. Whose exemption proceeded partly
from the infirmity of their sexe, not able to endure so long a journey;
partly to protect their chastity in such a concourse of people; and part∣ly
that they might attend their young Children, and family-affaires. For
though God gave them
 assurance, that during their husbands absence,
no enemy should invade the land; yet their tender
 children were not
exempted from inconveniencies which might arise if their mothers were
away from them.






Philol.


Me thinkes the place in the 
Temple,
 where the Sacrifices were
slain and fleaed, seems too small for such a purpose, if all the Paschall
Lambes (computed by 
Iosephus
 to be thousands) were as the 
Rabbins

will have it) all killed by the Priests in the 
Temple,
 and that betwixt the

two Evenings, (i. e.
 between three and six a clock in the afternoon) no
longer time being allotted thereunto? I say, if so, a far greater square then
what is presented in your Map was requisite for that service.






Aleth.


I am not bound to finde room for all their Lambes. Sufficeth
it that I have exactly followed my pattern in the dimensions of the
place. But to the point, may I be so bold as to whisper my opinion in
your eare; I conceive that, after the 
 (or 
Priests
 appointed to
view the blemishes of Lambes)
 had at more leasure approved those
Lambes legally perfect, a private person might sacrifice them in his own
house; and then the less room was required in the Temple for such
performances. And here I alledge the authority of 
Philo,
 affirming that
(as undoubtedly at the first institution of the 
Passeover
 and before the
erection of the 
Tabernacle
) every one was a 
Priest
 in his own family,


even in his days, and sufficiently qualified for the offering of such
sacrifices.






Philol.


You make staires ascending to the Altar, flatly against Gods
command;
 
Neither shalt thou goe up with steps unto my Altar;
 and the rea∣son
is rendered, 
that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.






Aleth.


To salve the matter, (and to reconcile our, with the 
Rabbins,

description) I conceive under the favour of 
Capellus,
 that the going up
to the Altar was not divided into steps (as he presenteth it) but that it
heightened it self by insensible degrees, being (though a Rise of many
Cubites) 
an even ascent
 (as I may term it) equally elevated, so that the
Priests, not striding, but pacing up thereon, were not necessitated to any

 divarication of their feet, which might occasion the discovery of any
uncomeliness.






Philol.


You make the 
Holy
 immediately continued to the 
Holy of Holies,

whereas there was a Cubit distance betwixt them, and that covered with
two vailes, which 
interstitium
 was called 
, by the 
Rabbins.






Aleth.


I have read as much in their writings, and that they were un∣resolved
whether to refer this space to the 
Holy
 or 
Holy of Holies;
 (like
the condition of dying men in 
transitu,
 dubious whether to be accounted
in this or another world) and thence they say it was called 
, 
i. e.


 
Perturbation
 or 
disturbance,
 because the Priests were much disquieted
thereat to which part of the Temple to relate it. But what 
aith the
Psalmist? 
man
 
disquieteth himself in vain,
 as here the 
Rabbins
 do, causelesly
troubling themselves about that which appears not in Scripture. This
we know, the 
Temple
 (besides the 
Porch
) had two 
fair rooms,
 the 
Holy
 and

Holiest;
 but as for this 
partition-Closet
 betwixt them, no foundation there∣of
in Gods word.






Philol.


You confidently deny that the Ark was in the second Temple,
whereas, upon inspection of the 
Triumphant Marble
 of the 
Vespasians

in 
Rome,
 the same appeareth pourtraicted thereupon.






Aleth.


Their eyes are much mistaken which finde the 
Ark
 on that

Mon
ment,
 though something 
Ark-like,
 (but in very deed nothing else
but the 
Table of shew-bread
) be presented therein: as for further satisfacti∣on
we have caused
 here to be exemplified.






Philol.


You avouch an utter abolition of all 
Temple-Utensils,
 and no
surviving Reliques thereof at this day. I conceive the contrary may be
made good out of History and daily experience.






Aleth.


I confess the fingers of superstition have itched to be tampering
with them. But finding the same not to fadge, at last she was fain

Hands-off
 to desist from such improbable designes. One
 tells us of a chea∣ter
in 
France
 which many hundred years agoe pretended to 
Moses
 his

wonder-working Rod
 (though that of 
Aaron,
 not 
Moses,
 was preserved in the

Tabernacle
) and essayed to work miracles therewith, till at last he was

beaten with his own Rod,
 detected and punished for an impostor. I con∣fess


also that
 
Comestor,
 and out of him
 
Ribera
 in 
altari Lateranensi infra quod
dicitur esse Arca, In the Lateran Altar,
 say they [in 
Rome] beneath
 [within] 
which
IT IS SAID the Ark is;
 but both of them speak so uncertainly, and
put it on publick fame, that they teach us to deny the Truth thereof.






Philol.


You are very briefe in the destruction of the City and Temple
by the 
Romans,
 whereas so memorable a subject deserved a fuller de∣scription.






Aleth.


It is largely related by 
Iosephus
 to whom the Reader is referred;
onely I will adde a word of the remarkable time thereof. God graci∣ously
promised his people, 
Neither shall
 
any man desire thy land, when thou shalt
goe up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice a year.
 Obedience is better then
an Army to secure ones estate. As the 
Meniall-servants
 of great Persons
are protected in some cases, from 
Arrests,
 whilest they waite on their
Masters in publick imployment; so Gods people were priviledged
from damage during their attendance on him thrice a year in his
Temple; no invasion being found to befall them on that occasion
clean through the Scripture. But at last, in token that they, by their wic∣kedness,
had 
out-lawed
 themselves of his protection, and he withdrawn
his defending of them, the 
Romans
 besieged them in 
Ierusalem,
 coming
up thither on the solemn feast of the
 Passeover; and soon after both
Temple and City was destroyed, by 
Vespasian
 and 
Titus
 his son, seventy
two years after our Saviours birth. 
Not one stone of the Temple left upon ano∣ther;

though three towers of the City (
Ma
iamne, Phaselus,
 and 
Hippicus
)
were left standing; not out of pity, but pride; their devouring sword
leaving this mannerly bit on purpose, that posterity might tast how
strong the place was, to the greater credit of the conquerours.






Philol.


To adde to the solemnity of the State, 
Titus
 with his Father

Vespasian
 made a solemn Triumph in 
Rome,
 wherein the 
golden Table
 and

Candlestick,
 with other
 sacred Utensils of the Temple, formerly reve∣renced,
now derided, made once for Gods service, now served to adorn
the Trophees of Pagans. We read what befell
 
Belshazzar
 when he
quaffed in the vessels of the Temple. Some perchance might here expect
that God, to punish the profana
ion of these holy instrument
, should
then have shewed some signall judgment on the profaners. But the case
was altered, because the date of Ceremonies was then expired, the use of
Types ended, Christ the Truth being come: and the Moon may set ob∣scurely
without any mans taking notice of her, when the Sun is risen.






Aleth.


 The last and greatest Trophee then carried in triumph was the

 
LAW OF THE IEWS:
 probably that very numericall book,
the Authenti
k or Originall of the Law, which by Gods command
was constantly to be kept in the
 Temple. And this perchance was
permitted by divine providence, not without a peculiar mystery therein,
to shew, that the Law, which formerly 
bound men over
 to damnation,
was now 
bound
 it self in captivity, outed of its former dominion, deposed


from its condemning power, having now the 
Gospell of Grace
 succeeding
in the place thereof. Lastly, orders were issued out to the Governour of

Syria
 to set the whole land of 
Iudea
 to sale; which was done accordingly.
Time was, when by the 
Leviticall Law, Iewish
 land though 
old, yet at
the year of 
Iubile
 was to revert to the ancient
 owners; but now the
King of heaven granted such 
a license of Alienation,
 that it was fully and
finally 
passed
 away from its ancient possessors.






Philol.


 To perpetuate th
 memory of this 
Roman
 conquest, besides
many other monuments, 
Coins
 were stamped both in 
gold
 and
 
silver,

with the Image of 
Vespasian
 and 
Titus,
 on the one side, and on the 
reverse

a woman placed in a pensive posture under a 
Palme-tree,
 which tree was
the 
Hieroglyphick
 of 
Iudea,
 onely differing herein, that the 
Palme-tree
 the
more depressed, the more it flourisheth, whereas 
Iudea
 sunke under the
weight of her woes, and never again outgrew her miseries. And lest
men should miss the fancy of the Impress, they are guided thereunto by
the Motto subscribed, 
Iudaea capta, Iudea taken.






Aleth.


 What 
an on sight hereof would not call to minde the com∣plaint
of the Prophet,
 
How doth the City sit solitary that was full of people?
how is she become as a widow? she that was great among the nations, and Princess
among the Provinces, how is she become tributary?
 Great, no doubt, was the grief
of the 
Iews
 hereat. But few drops seasonably showred, would preserve
the green blade from withering, when much rain cannot revive the
roots once withered. Eyes dry for their sins, are vainly wet after their
sufferings: and a drought in the Spring is not to be repaired by a deluge
in the Autumn.








CHAP. XX. Objections, concerning the Description of Mount Libanus, answered.




Philol.


YOu make 
Libanus
 to be the north-ridge of these hills, and 
Anti-Libanus

to be the south part thereof, clean contrary unto lear∣ned

 
Munster
 in his description of it.






Aleth.


Munster
 is singular therein, unseconded by any other Authors.
However, the controversie is not important as touching Scripture,
wherein this distinction appears not at all, both the north and south
chains of those mountains being promiscuously called 
Libanus
 in 
Holy
Writ.
 Some humane Authors lay this distinction in point of east and
west, so great is the difference among them. If I may freely profess my
opinion herein, I conceive that the inhabitants of this mountain, termed
the place of their own habitation, wheresoever they dwelt, 
Libanus,
 and
named the mountains of their overthwart neigh
bours 
Anti-Libanus:
 as
commonly men account their own Religion onely to be 
Christianity,



and all such opinions as are opposite to their own, 
Antichristian






Phil
l.


In your Map generall of old 
Canaan,
 the Island of 
Arvad
 (or

Aradus
) is not above forty miles from 
Zidon,
 which in this Map of
mount 
Libanus
 are fourscore miles asunder. Indeed I have read of a

floating Isle in Scotland,
 moving from place to place with the winde and
waves. But is this 
Isle of Aradus
 fixed to no firmer foundations, so that
it hath swom forty miles more northward in this, then in your former

draught
 thereof?






Aleth.


May you be pleased to remember, that in our instructions
 pre∣mised
to the Reader, we gave notice that places standing on the 
Um-stroke▪

or utmost line of any Map, denote not their accurate position, but situ∣ation
thereabouts, to clear the continuation of the Countrey. Such the
location of 
Arvad
 in our former Map, which in this of mount 
Libanus
 is
placed according to the true distance thereof.






Philol.


You make the River 
Aban
 (in heathen Authors 
Chrysorrho
s
)
to sink into the ground, without communicating it self to the sea.
This is out of the common road of nature, that this River should be
free from paying tribute to the 
Ocean,
 to which all smaller waters are in∣debted.
Yea and
 
Adrichomius
 (no doubt on good authority) maketh
it, when passing from 
Dam
scus,
 to run through a plain called 
Arch abod,

and so into the 
Syrian,
 or 
Medite
ranean-sea.






Aleth.


His error therein is confuted, both by ancient, and modern
writers. 
Strabo
 speaking thereof, 
.

Which Chrysorrho
s beginning from the City, and Countrey of Damascus,
in a manner is wholly spent in drains thence derived; for it watereth much ground,
and that very deep.
 Some thing more may be collected from 
Ptolemies
 ex∣pression,
not terming the fall of 
Chrysorrhoas
 
 (his ordinary word)
the 
Out-lets,
 or 
Ejections
 thereof into the sea, but onely 
, the

End,
 or 
determination
 thereof. Where, by the degrees by him assigned,

Be
tius
 in his Maps presenteth this River swallowed up wholly in the
sands: and the same is confessed by 
Bellonius
 an eye-witness thereof, and
other modern
 
Geographers,
 that it never cometh unto any sea.






Philol.


You have omitted the 
Vale of Salt
 in your Map (near 
Aram
 Zo∣ba
)
neither mentioning in your description that most memorable de∣feat,
which 
David
 gave the 
Syrians
 therein. Your modern Merchants of

Aleppo
 will inform you thereof, who have been on the very place where
the battell was fought, as tradition reporteth.






Aleth.


I have heard so much from the mouths of my judicious

 friends, which have lived in those parts: and have formerly read the
same in effect; How, 
within halfe a days-journey
 
of Aleppo, there is a very great
plain, without grass growing on it, the sand whereof is naturally good salt, and after
rain being dried again with the Sun, the people gather it.
 However, I cannot be
perswaded, that this 
Salt Vale
 was the place, whereon 
David
 gave his


enemies that notable overthrow, as on the perusall of the following
Scriptures will appear.


2 Sam. 8. 13
And David gat him a name
when he returned from smiting
the Syrians in the valley of Salt
being eighteen thousand men.
And he put garrisons in Edom,
throughout all Edom put he gar∣risons.
1 Chr. 18. 12.
Moreover Abishai
the sonne of Zerviah
slew of the Edomites
in the valley of Salt,
eighteen thousand.
Inscription of Psal. 60.
To the chief Musician upon
Sushan-Eduth; Michtam of Da∣vid,
to teach. When he strove
with Aram Maharaim, and
with Aram Zobah, when Ioab
returned and smote of Edom in
the valley of Salt, twelve thousand.

Here under favour, I conceive, these severall Scriptures intend one, and
the same victory, because fought in the same place, the 
Valley of Salt,

whilest the seeming contradictions, in the names of the 
Conquerors,
 dif∣ferent

numbers,
 and 
nations
 of the persons 
conquered,
 are easiely reconciled:



1. 
Ioab
 (as 
Generall
) might 
give the Command,
 and 
Abishai (Lieutenant
Generall
) do the execution, whilest 
David
 (as 
Soveraign
) received
the 
honour
 of the 
Action.


2. 
Twelve thousand
 might be slain 
on the place,
 and six more kild 
in the
pursuit,
 so making up 
eighteen thousand
 in the totall number.


3. This slaughter fell on the 
Edomites,
 who are called 
Syrians,
 not by
their Countrey (though 
Syria
 taken in a large sense is compre∣hensive
of many nations) but 
cause,
 and 
confederacy,
 as ingaging
themselves (to their cost) auxiliaries in the same quarrell of the

Syrians
 against King 
David.



This battell thus stated (with most probability in my opinion) it seems
fought rather in the 
land
 of 
Edom,
 where there is another 
Valley of Salt
 emi∣nent
in
 Scripture, and not near 
Aleppo,
 or 
Aram Zobah.
 However, because

Tradition is a Tyrant
 on the contrary, I dare resolve nothing positively, but
suspend my own, and attend the judgments of others herein.






Philol.


You make 
Marra
 the next modern stage south of 
Aleppo:
 where∣as
there be many moe miles, and intermediate lodging-places (namely

Cane-Toman,
 and
 
Saracoop
) betwixt them.






Aleth.


I confess no less, but am sorry your memory is so short, that I
must so often incultate the same rule unto you: That places situate on
the 
Um-stroke
 (such the location of 
Aleppo
 in our Map) are not in their
exact position, whilest we onely make a long arme to reach them con∣fusedly
into our description, though otherwise they be at greater
distance, then the scale of miles will admit.






Philol.


I wonder you make the 
Mediterranean
 from 
Tripoli
 to 
Antioch,

to run with such a crooked flexure, in form of an 
Hook,
 which certainly
will not catch the beleefe of any judicious beholder thereof. The rather
because no Geographers take cognizance of it, and such a bending is
disavowed by all modern Maps.






Aleth.


Consult 
Ptolemies
 Maps (as drawn by learned 
Bertius
) and
they present the fashion thereof accordingly: though such an 
Elbow
 ap∣pears


not in the late Cardes of this Countrey. No news now adays for

Sea
 to gain, 
Land
 to lose, or (reciprocally) both to alter their ancient,
and accept new forms: seeing our 
Cornish-men
 will tell us, that a good
piece of their 
horn
 is blunted, and broken off by the sea: whose land
formerly stretched out more westward, and was
 called (as they say)

Lioness,
 before the waters devoured both the 
paws,
 and whole 
body

thereof.








CHAP. XXI. Objections answered against the eastern confines of Palestine.




Philol.


YOu have left the eastern part of this Map altogether empty,
which you ought to have furnished with moe towns, and
Cities therein.






Aleth.


Whose image and superscription
 doth this Map 
bear?
 Is it not of

Arabia the desert,
 a wild barren Countrey? To make a 
desert full,
 is as ab∣surd,
as to paint a 
Black-more faire.
 Besides, whence should the Geogra∣pher
fetch the names of these Cities, except from his own groundless
fancy? And then, as King 
Edgar
 is said to have founded in 
England
 as
many 
Monasteries
 as there be weeks in the year, a Map-maker might
build moe Cities then there be hours therein, whilest the Reader must
have as much simplicity, as the Author dishonesty, that gives credit there∣unto.






Philol.


You have false pointed (to use your own
 expression) the

Iewish
 peregrinations, seeing those four intermediate stages (
Comma's,
 as
you term them) be 
Ar, Mattanah, Nahaliel,
 and 
Bamoth,
 being named
after the stream of 
Arnon,
 seem on the other side of the River, and there∣fore
rather to be placed in the Tribe of 
Reuben.






Aleth.


I have consulted the text, and best Comments upon it, and
cannot yet be convinced, but that the same is rightly situate. 
Arnon
 I
conceive divided into many streams, therefore plurally termed the 
brooks
of
 
Arnon,
 probably tributary brooks running into that main River: and
though the places aforesaid lay north of these rivolets, they were south
of the main 
Arnon,
 and in the land of 
Moab.
 However, because of their
so ambiguous posture, being more willing to learn then to teach, I am
ready to alter them on any better information.






Philol.


You make 
Iobs sons tent
 in your Map blown down on his
children therein, whereas
 Scripture calleth it expresly an 
house,
 and other∣wise
it is unlikely they should be slain, with such slight curtains falling
upon them.






Aleth.


I will not plead that a 
tent
 is also termed an 
house
 in Scripture

 phrase, that tent-dwelling was most fashionable in the eastern Coun∣tries,


especially in that ancient age, that 
statory,
 or long standing tents
were quilted with timber, for their stronger support; that 
Iob
 children
might be (though not killed with weight) stifled with the closeness of
the very linnen in the 
tent,
 when Satan with such violence in a 
vengeance,

drave it in upon them; but fairly charge it on the account of the Graver
following his own fancy therein.






Philol.


You have made the 
Red-sea
 too near to the 
Dead-sea,
 presenting
not above sixty miles distance betwixt them, when there is much more
in all authentick descriptions of them. See now what covetousness
doeth, it makes men guilty of much falshood, as here your over-gree∣diness
to recover 
Ezion Gaber
 within this Map, hath tempted you to
trespass on due proportion.






Aleth.


I confess the main channell of the 
Red-sea
 runs many miles
more south-west; but this 
Bay
 called 
Sinus Elaniticu
;
 from 
 (E
ath

in Scripture, a fair City built by
 
Uzziah,
 and restored to 
I
ah,
 hard
by 
Ezion Gaber
) buncheth out more to the north, and in M
r
. 
Mores
 Maps,
and others of good credit, is advanced as near to the 
Dead-sea,
 as in this
our description. Besides, I have good reason to conceive, that this 
Reach

of the 
Red-sea,
 anciently stretched more north-ward, then now adays;
even to the City of 
Elana,
 or 
Elath,
 whence it takes its name; because in

Ptolemies
 Map, 
Elana
 is set in the land, some miles distance from the Sea;
whither, no doubt, it reached formerly, and made an haven for 
Ezion
Gaber
 thereabouts.






Philol.


But, how can 
Ezion Gaber
 stand on the 
Red-sea,
 when we read
of 
Huram
 King of 
Tyre
 (an haven sufficiently known to be seated on the

Mediterranean
) that he 
sent
 
ships
 to 
Solomon
 to 
Ezion Gaber?
 Surely, they
sailed not round about 
Africa,
 much less can you conceive them to goe
over land, (ships having 
fins,
 and not 
feet
) and a 
shole of fish
 may with as
much probability be driven over the 
Continent.






Aleth.


Here Sir, I will not tell you of the 
Prince of Orange
 his constant∣ly
carrying boats to make bridges of (though of no great burden) in
his wagons: much less will I instance in those seventy lesser ships, and
Galliots, brought by 
Zoganes Bassa Anno 1453. up a
 
great hill, and so by
dry land with all their sails abroad▪
 out of the 
Bosphorus,
 the space of eight
miles, into the haven of 
Constantinople,
 by an ingenious device, and a
great strength of men to manage it, whereby the said City was soon
after unexpectedly taken by the 
Turke.
 An invention formerly found
out, and practised by the 
Venetians
 at the lake of 
Bennacus.
 But, waving
these things, take notice, I pray, of two memorable passages concerning
the matter in hand.


1 King. 9. 26.
And King Solomon made
a navy of Ships in Ezion
Gaber.
2 Chron. 8. 18.
And Huram sent him [to Ezion Gaber] by the 

of his servants, Ships, and servants that had know∣ledge
of the sea.

The result of both is this, 
Solomons
 ships were built in the place at 
Ezion


Gaber,
 where all their lumber, and ma
sie timber was provided, at the

Dock
 wherein they were made: whilest their 
tackling,
 and other essenti∣all
implements thereof (easily portable when taken in pieces) might be
sent from 
Tyre
 by land-carriages. Such far carting being part of the bur∣dens

Solomon
 imposed on the people, whereof they afterwards so grie∣vously

 complained: or else by 
Hurams
 sending ships, by a 
Metonymie of
the cause
 understand 
ship-rights,
 such as found materials there, and brought
art and industry (virtually with the former a whole navy) thither with
them.






Philol.


Seeing 
Edom
 bounded north-ward on the 
Dead,
 south-ward
on the 
Redsea
 (whereon stood 
Ezion Gaber
 in the land of
 
Edom
) how
can the children of 
Israel
 be conceived (when denyed passage through
it) to
 
compass the land of Edom
 without coming into any part thereof, ex∣cept
they went into the water?






Aleth.


Understand it, they went not the nearest way to 
Canaan
 through
the heart, and fruitfull middle of 
Edom,
 but surrounded the same, going
through the borders thereof (leaving the 
Red-sea
 on the right hand)
where their passage was no whit prejudiciall to the 
Edomites,
 as being
through a base Countrey secured against the long stay of any passengers
therein, by its own barrenness. Besides,
 some conceive the land of

Edom
 extended not anciently so far as the 
Red sea,
 so that in 
Moses
 his time

Ezion Gaber
 belonged not thereunto, though in the days of 
Solomon
 ac∣counted
parcell thereof.








CHAP. XXII. Objections against the Wilderness of Paran answered.




Philol.


IN your Map of 
Simeon
 and 
Iudah,
 you make that the 
River of
Egypt,
 which runs nigh 
Rinocolura
 into the 
Mediterranean sea.
 And
here you call both that brook that runs into the 
Syrbon Lake,
 as also the
easternmost stream of 
Nilus
 by the name of the 
River of Egypt.
 How comes
this triplication? Where the Scripture presents but one, you multiply
three 
Rivers of Egypt.






Aleth.


You put me in minde of a passage 
Bishop Latimer
 confesseth of
himself, whilest as yet a young Priest, and zealous Papist. He, being en∣joined
by the 
Rubrick
 to mingle water with the wine in the 
Ch
lice
 at
Mass, was so
 scrupulous to doe it effectually, that he powred in water
so much, and so often, that he almost diluted all into water. Such is
the 
 of my caution
 herein, who have 
Egypt-rivered
 this Map to pur∣pose,
willing to please all without displeasing of the truth. You know
who saith,
 
If it be possible, as much as in you lyeth have peace with all men,
 as
herein I have endevoured. For,





1 The 
Rivolet
 south of 
Simeon,
 by generall consent


2 That running into the 
Syrbon-lake,
 by M
r
. 
More


3 The easternmost stream of 
Nile,
 by 
Bochartus


is made the 
Ri∣ver of Egypt.



Thus each opinion having learned men to patronize it, we equally ten∣der
them all to the Readers discretion, to reject, or accept which of them he shall conclude most probable.






Philol.


You make 
Sinai
 (where the Law was given) a different, and
distinct mountain from mount 
Horeb.
 Whereas in Scripture it plainly
appears, that 
Horeb
 was the same with 
Sinai,
 two names for one and the
same mount. For, that the Law was given in 
Sinai,
 all agree, and the
same is attributed to 
Horeb
 also. 
The Lord our God made a covenant with us
in
 
Horeb.—The Lord talked with you face to face in the mount, out of the midst
the fire.






Aleth.


Some
 conceive this mountain (as 
Moses
 is erroneously fanci∣ed

with hornes
) to rise up 
Parnassus
-like, with a double top; whereof the
one is called 
Horeb,
 the other 
Sinai.
 Or else the former, like the 
Alpes,
 is a
genericall name to many, whilest 
Sinai,
 like mount 
Senis
 amongst the

Alpes,
 is more eminent and conspicuous then the rest, for the height
thereof.






Philol.


Seeing the Spies were sent from
 
Kadesh-Barnea
 to discover
the Land, a City afterwards assigned to
 
Iudah,
 how come you to make
the 
Israelites
 to incamp so many miles south of the same place?






Aleth.


None can be so wild as to conceive that the 
Israelites
 during
their journeying in the wilderness, ever came within the walls of any
City, but always pitched in the open desert. This premised, when they
are said to be
 in 
Kadesh-Barnea,
 we understand thereby a Countrey, not
City, so named, which began southwardly about 
Rithmah
 (the fifteenth
station of the 
Israelities,
 whence they sent their spies) and extended north∣wardly
to 
Kadesh-Barnea properly so called,
 (probably a City) certainly a
limitary place belonging afterwards to the Tribe of 
Iudah.






Philol.


You term their provocation of God in this place
 
as yet the last
and greatest temptation,
 which seems to me not of so hainous a nature.






Aleth.


So many and great were their Rebellions, it is hard to define
which was their highest offence. Their carriage for forty years is styled
by God a
 
day of temptation,
 whose transgressions were so frequent and
came so fast, that they all compleated but one intire, constant, and con∣tinued
temptation. But to the point, that this their 
despising of the
 
pleasant
land
 was a paramount impietie, appears not onely by the exclusion of
that whole generation from entering the same, but by the confession of
modern 
Iews: Manasseh Ben Israel
 (the Hebrew Divine at this day in

Amsterdam
) observes the ninth day of the moneth 
Ab,
 whereon saith he

 
Exploratores flebant sinecau
a, The spies sent to discover the land
 [and all the congregation occasioned by their false reports]
 
wept without cause,
 hath ever since been unfortunate to their nation, their first, and second Temple


being burnt on the same day, and many dysasters have since befallen
them thereon. Thus the 
Iews travell far off
 in their inquiries, fetching the
cause of their misfortunes from their forefathers 
in the wilderness
 more
then 
three thousand years
 agoe, which with more ease might 
take up their
lodging
 nearer hand, and finde the same in their crucifying of Christ, as
their highest sin, and the cause of their deepest suffering.






Philol.


Think you that 
Rithmah
 (the 
fifteenth
 stage of the 
Israelites
) was the
particular place, whither the spies returned bringing the report of 
Canaan?






Aleth.


Though many conceive so, under favour I take it more pro∣bable,
that the next mansion, 
Rimmon-parez
 by name, was the proper

scene
 of that action. For, it signifieth in 
Hebrew
 the 
Division of Pomegra∣nates,

so called (as I conceive) not from any growing there (too bar∣ren
a place for such beautifull fruit) but brought thither by the 
Spies

(
 
Pomegranates
 being specified amongst the fruits of the land) which
here were 
divided,
 and shared among the people of 
Israel,
 to show them
a 
sample
 of the fruitfullness of 
Canaan.






Philol.


What a blank and vacuity have you left betwixt 
Ezion-Gaber

the 
thirty second,
 and 
Kadesh-Zin
 the 
thirty third
 station of the 
Israelites (sixty
miles
 at least) without any stage interposed? It is not probable that they
travelled so far, without resting themselves betwixt them.






Aleth.


Surely they had intermediate Mansions where they took their
nightly repose, though not named by 
Moses,
 because not making any con∣siderable
abode therein. I conceive, that after their departure from 
Ezion-Gaber,

God quickned the 
Israelites
 (who truanted before in their slow,
and snail-like proceedings) making them mend their pace, probably tra∣velling
every day will they came to 
Kadesh,
 which their young men might
the better endure, the old generation being almost worn out.






Philol.


How comes 
Aaron
 to be buried in mount
 
Hor,
 whom else∣where
the Scripture affirmeth to be interred in
 
Mosera?






Aleth.


It is no news to have severall names for the same place. The forest
of 
Black-more,
 and the forest of
 
White-Hart
 (though 
black
 and 
white
 be
contrary colours) signifie the self same tract of ground in 
Dorset-shire.
Hor
 was
 the east part, and 
Mosera
 the west part of this mountain. This

Mosera
 had formerly been the
 
twenty seventh
 Mansion of the 
Israelites
 in
their passage to 
Ezion-Gaber,
 near which afterwards they made their

thirty fourth
 station (when 
Aaron
 was buried there) which sufficiently argues the crookedness of their journying, crossing those parts again
where they had been before.






Philol.


I commend your cunning that hath slipt over in silence, four
of the hardest names contained all in one verse 
Deut. 1. 1. These be the words
which Moses spake unto all Israel, on this side Iordan in the wilderness, in the plain
over against the Red-sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Luban, and Hazer
th,
and Dizahab,
 Direct us to the position of these places.






Aleth.


Some
 conceive the
 
plains of Moab
 (wherein 
Moses
 wrote the


book of 
Deuteronomy
) described thereby with the eminent bounds
(though at some distance) round about it, in manner following.





Others refuse this interpretati∣on,
as an obscure, and far
fetch'd bounding of 
those plains,

preferring our 
English
 translati∣on
(reading it 
Red-sea,
 in stead
of 
Zuph,
 or 
Sedgie-land
) and so
making these severall places the
signall stages of the children of

Israel
 in their passage out of

Egypt.
 Whereof the 
Red-sea,
 and

Paran
 are sufficiently known,

Laban
 the same with 
Libna
 their
 seventeenth station;
 
Hazeroth
 the
place where 
Miriam
 was punished with leprosie; 
Dizahab,
 which the
Greek renders 
golden mines,
 and the 
Chaldee
 refers to the place where the
golden
 Calfe was made, and stamped to powder, whilest 
Tophel
 (not
mentioned again in Scripture) is conceived some station in 
Paran.
 Thus

Deuteronomy
 is a repetition of the law, and of the memorable actions
which occurred at these severall places.






Philol.


I object nothing against the draught of the 
Tabernacle,
 because
the authority of 
Arias Montanus
 (whence you confess it taken) will pass
it without exception. But I question the exactness of severall places in
your Map of 
Egypt.






Aleth.


You minde me of a Gentlemans finding a 
Picture
 in the shop
of a 
Country-Painter,
 whom he mistook for the maker thereof, and there∣upon
fell a finding many faults therein. But being informed that the
same was 
drawn
 by one of the rarest 
Masters
 in 
Italy,
 he instantly turned
his cavilling at, into commending thereof. Such a convent your judg∣ment
will quickly be when I shall tell you that the Map of 
Egypt
 is of

Ortelius
 his making, save onely that the southern part thereof (uselesse
for our history) is cut off, and such places onely inserted herein as appears
in Scripture. The same I plead for the 
Habits,
 and 
Idols
 of the 
Iews;
 the
former taken all out of Scripture, the latter out of such Authors as are se∣verally
cited in our description. Onely I could wish, that in the Picture of

Moloch
 out of 
Benjamins Itinerarie
 the three statues had been presented 
it∣ting
according to our
 directions. And by the 
Altar to the unknown God
 we
mean not that erected in 
Athens
 (to a 
Grecian,
 no 
Iewish Deity
) but onely
we intend the same for a reserve for those many 
Iewish
 Idols, whose
names, and severall worships are unknown unto us. But, it is time to
break off, lest one 
grand objection
 be made against all our 
Objections
 and

Answers,
 that they swell the volume into tediousness.












EZEKIEL his VISIONARY
LAND OF CANAAN.




CHAP. I. Ezekiels visionary Land, City, and Temple uncapable of a literall meaning.


§ 1. 
P
Erusing the nine last Chapters of 
Ezekiels
 prophesie
(invited thereunto with the mention of many
places in 
Palestine
) whilest I hoped to find,
 and feel
a 
Solid body,
 I onely grasped the 
flitting aire,
 or rather
a 
meer spirit;
 I mean in stead of a literall sense I
found the 
Canaan
 by him described no 
Geography,

but 
Ouranography,
 no earthly truth, but mysticall prediction. Now, his
Description will appear irreconcileable with a literall interpretation
(no 
Topicall,
 but a bare 
Typicall
 relation) if the particular location of the
Tribes therein be seriously considered.


§ 2. For, so transposed, and inverted is the method of their severall
portions, as neither reducible to an agreement with the order of their

birth,
 nor 
blessing
 by 
Iacob,

nor division of the land
by lot in 
Ioshua's,





nor parting it into
Purveyorships in the
days of 
Solomon.
 Behold
here in this rud
 draught
how the seven northern
Tribes, as it were, march
before in the 
Van;
 whilest
the five southern Tribes
bring up the 
Rere.
 See
the Temple in the midst,
supported with the
Priests portion on both
sides, and that of the Le∣vites
coming behind, and holding up the train thereof (parting the
Temple from the City) whilest the Princes portion flanketh it on both


sides. 
Quav
s dictio, contradictio;
 Each word flatly opposeth the literall
position of those Tribes and places, and therefore the interpretation
thereof 
Is risen it is, not here,
 not buried beneath in the words, but is
mounted above in the mystery.


§ 3. Adde hereunto the miraculous fruit (
unfading and new every moneth
)
which this land produced,
 one 
leafe
 whereof was more worth then all
the great
 
Grapes, Pomegranates,
 and 
Figs,
 the 
Spies
 brought from 
Canaan,

as being 
unfading
 and
 soveraign 
for medicines.
 Now surely such as under∣stand
this literally have need of some of those 
Leaves
 to cure their 
distem∣pers

therein.


§ 4. It will be objected,
 that this 
Propheticall Palestine
 makes frequent
mention of 
Seas,
 
Great Sea,
 and
 
East Sea; River, Io
dan, Mountain, Gilead;

besides the land is bounded, North, South, and East with severall places
of name, and note, as
 
Hethlon, Zedad, H
math
 &c. Now, what saith
our Saviour?
 
A spirit hath not flesh and bones,
 meer visions are of a more rarified,
and attenuated nature, not consisting of such gross, and drossie parts,
and therefore the Prophet seems rather to be taken 
at his word,

and his literall relation to be embraced, without farther search for a mysticall
meaning therein.


§ 5. It is answered,
 
Omnis visio fundatur in historia;
 the most refined
vision hath some mixture of, and analogie with an historicall truth. As
in a 
Web,
 the stamen, or 
Warp,
 it fast fixed, through which the 
Woofe
 is
cast, or woven; 
o there re certain 
standards
 in all visions, being the
materiall and corporall ground-work, for a spirituall flourish, or des∣cant
to improve it self thereupon. More particularly, because so many
places of 
Palestine
 are named in this vision; yea, seeing the body there∣of
is confo
med to an 
unlike likeliness
 (as I may terme it) of the earthly

Canaan,
 it intima
es, that the 
Iewish
 nation shall have more then a single
share in the accomplishment of this Prophesie, and have their happi∣ness
highly concerned in the performa
ce thereof.


§ 6. As the 
Land,
 so the 
City
 described by the Prophet, is not appliable
to the earthly 
Ierusalem.
 It is said of Christ, 
Thou art
 
fairer then the children
of men;
 sure I am, this City as presented by the Prophet, was fairer, finer,
slicker smoother, more exact, more uniforme then any fabrick the earth
afforded. This 
Triumphant Ierusalem
 (as I may term it) was a compleate
square of 
four
 
thousand five hundred reeds,
 with a just 
Iury
 of
 gates, three
of each side, according to the names of the 
twelve Tribes
) with most re∣gular
suburbs, reaching 
two hundred and fifty reeds
 every way, so 
terse,
 so

trim,
 that not an house started out of its due proportion. Whereas the
literall 
Ierusalem,
 built by parcels at severall times, on abrupt precipices,
ranged about with the wals rather for strength, then beauty, being on
the East and South suburbless, and without such correspondency, either
in the number, or position of the gates thereof. In a word, that so exact
structure in the Prophet, never sprang by art out of earth, but was let


down by a miracle from heaven▪ to which Saint 
Iohn
 alludes in his ce∣lestiall
 
Ierusalem.


§ 7. Lastly, the Temple, as framed by the Prophet, is not suitable
with 
Solomons,
 and the very waters rising from under the threshold there∣of,
encreasing by degrees unto an unpassable
 river, doe drown all possi∣bility
of a literall sense therein. Expect not here, I should intermeddle
with a particular description of the foresaid Land, City, and Temple;
both because they being meerly mysticall are alien from our subject, and
because I am deterred from so difficult an undertaking by the ensuing
computation.



1 
Moses
 saith, 
the days of our
 
years are threescore years, and ten.


2 The 
Iews
 made an ordinance, that none should read this vision,
till 
thirty years old.


3 
Villalpandus
 confesseth, he studied this Prophesie twenty three
years, yet understood not the difficulties thereof.



If life be so short, and we must begin so late, and study so long on this
Prophesie alone (without attaining the full understanding thereof)
high time at the end of those studying years, to leave the 
measuring
 of
this vision, and survey the 
dimensions
 of our own 
Graves.


§ 8. To conclude,
 as once our Saviour told 
Pilate,
 
My kingdome is not
of this world:
 so the sense of 
Ezekiels
 Land, City, and Temple, is not car∣nall,
and corporall, but mysticall, and spirituall. Yea, God may seem of set
purpose to have troubled, and perplexed the text, imbittering the 
Nibbles

thereof with inextricable difficulties, meerly to 
wean
 us from the 
milke
 of
the letter, and make us with more appetite seek for stronger meat there∣in.
For the main therefore, it is generally conceived, this vision imports
the great inlargement, and dilatation of the Church under the Gospell,
when the 
Gentiles
 shall be called to the knowledge of Christ, and the

Iews
 also (as mainly concerned, though not solely intended in this visi∣on)
brought home to their true Messiah, not excluding even
those of the 
ten Tribes,
 from having each one his 
Childs-portion
 in the per∣formance
of this Prophesie. A word or two of whose condition, since
their captivity.






CHAP. II. What became of the ten Tribes since their captivity, and where
probably extant at this day.


§ 1. POlitick was the practice of the Kings of 
Assyria,
 when conquer∣ing
a Countrey, neither to kill the natives thereof, nor to con∣tinue
them any longer in their own land, but to transport them into a
far distant Countrey, and in exchange planting other colonies in their
room. For, first to kill them (besides the cruelty thereof in cold bloud)


had been an improvident act, men amongst them being precious to
people their vast dominions, which otherwise, if empty, had been more
exposed to the invasion of enemies. To continue them in their own
land had not been safe; who, best knowing the advantages thereof,
would on all occasions practice the recovery of their lost liberty; and
therefore to prevent farther disputes, the 
subject of the question was taken
away,
 and they advisedly disposed of in far distant places. Lastly, the re∣moving
them into other parts, and substituting others in their land,
taught both these plantations an immediate dependence on their Prince,
(having no other plea but his bare pleasure for their present possessions)
which made them, (like the Turkish 
Timario
s
) more dutifull at home,
and daring abroad in their undertakings.


§ 2. These reasons moved the Kings of 
Assyria
 to transport the 
Isra∣elites

from their native soil. Indeed they, if any people, might term the
land 
their own,
 having a threefold ti
e thereunto; by 
Donation
 from God,
the supreme Proprietary; by 
conquest
 of the 
Canaanites,
 the ancient owners;
by 
prescription
 of more then seven hundred years peaceable possession
thereof. But this 
threefold cable
 was broken with the weight of their sins,
and so was 
Israel
 carried away from their
 
own land to Assyria unto this day.

Even 
Lands
 as well as 
Goods
 are 
moveables,
 though not from their 
Center,

from their 
Owners,
 at leastwise the owners are moveable from their lands.


§ 3. Yet God did not all at once begin,
 and end the captivity of the

ten Tribes,
 but 
, 
at sundry times, and in diverse manners.

For,



1
 
P
l
 King of 
Assyria
 in the reign of
 
Menahem
 carried the 
Reube∣nites,
Gadites,
 and half Tribe of 
Manasseh
 away to the Cities of the

Medes.


2 
Tiglath-Pi
eser
 in the days of 
Pekah,
 transported (besides 
Gilead,

and the remains of the aforesaid Tribes)
 
Galilee;
 namely, so
much thereof as was in the land of 
Naphtali,
 unto 
Assyria.


3 
Shalmaneser
 cleared all the rest in the ninth year of 
Hoshea,
 carrying
them away to
 
Halath,
 and 
Habor,
 by the River 
Gozan
 in the
Cities of the 
Medes.



Probably the second, or middle captivity of the 
Naphtalites,
 afterwards
removed themselves into 
Tartary,
 where 
Ortelius
 findes their very name,
and a City called 
Tabor
 (
 
Asnoth-Tabor
 we know was a place in the bor∣der
of 
Naphtali
) imposed (no doubt) to perpetuate the memory of their
native Countrey.


§ 4. Scripture gives us no account what afterwards became of these

ten Tribes.
 Onely in
 
Esdras
 (
 book accounted by some as the 
Ap
rypha

of the 
Apocrypha,
 because never owned for 
Canonicall,
 either by the 
Iews,
Romish
 
Church
 in generall, or Protestant writers) we finde them tra∣velling
over 
Euphrates
 (miraculously dried up in their passage) towards

Arsareth
 [or 
Tartary
] a great way; namely, 
a journey of a
 
year and an half.
 A


long stride indeed, and yet might be but little, if mending their pace no
more then their ancestors did in their passage between 
Egypt,
 and 
Canaan.

But waving 
Esdras
 his single testimony, these 
ten Tribes
 appeare not since
in any authenticall relation; strange! that the posterity of the two
Tribes (
Iudah
 and 
Benjamin
) should be found [almost] 
every where,

whilest the off-spring of the 
ten Tribes
 are found 
no where!
 Thu
 God
hath on them 
 that curse which he formerly threatned, 
To scatter
them into corners, and make the
 
remembrance of them to cease.
 Not, that he hath
utterly extinguished the 
being
 (an opinion as unreasonable, as unchari∣table)
but hath hitherto concealed the 
known b
ing
 of so numerous a na∣tion,
whom we may call the 
lost-lo
t sheep of Israel;
 both in respect of their
spirituall condition, and corporall habitation.


§ 5.
 Some
 conceive the modern 
Am
ricans
 of the Jewish race, col∣lecting
the same from some resemblances in rites, community of
customes, conformity of clothes, fragments of letters, foot-steps of
knowledge, ruines of language, (though by a casuall coincidence some
straggling words of the 
Athenians
 may meet in the mouths of the veriest

Barbarians
) and many other 
Iudaismes
 amongst the 
Indians.
 And lately,
a
 Jewish 
Rabbin
 of 
Amsterdam
 tels us, that beyond the 
Cordiller
 hills, and
river 
Maragnon,
 a fair people are found with long beards, and rich in
clothes, living by themselves, different in religion from the rest of the

Indians,
 whom he will have to be the 
ten Tribes
 there remaining in a bo∣dy
together. His arguments so prevaile on some, formerly contrarily
minded, as to 
turn the tyde
 of their judgment to concur with his, with
others they make it 
dead water,
 not to oppose his opinion, whilest a
third sort listen to his relation, as onely priviledged from confutation by
the remoteness thereof.


§ 6. For mine own part,
 I behold his report as the 
Twilight,
 but whe∣ther
it will prove the 
morning twilight,
 which will improve it self into full
light; or that of the 
evening,
 darkening by degrees into silence, and ut∣ter
obscurity, time will discover. When the 
eleven Tribes
 (so virtually
may I term them) brought news that one lost Tribe [
Ioseph
] was found,

Iacobs heart
 
fainted, for he beleeved them not,
 till afterwards he was convinced
on clearer evidence. How much more then may I be permitted to
suspend my judgment, when one man brings tydings of 
ten lost Tribes,

all found in an instant, untill farther proof be made thereof? Surely we,
who now secretly smile at some probable insinuations in his report,
shall on better assurance have our 
mouthes filled with
 
laughter
 (not
 
Sarahs
laughter
 of distrust, but
 
Abrahams,
 of desire, delight, and beliefe) when
his relation shall be confirmed to us from other hands. And indeed,
the messenger deserves to be well paid for his pains, who brings clear
proof thereof, the discovery of the posterity of these 
ten Tribes
 being an
happy 
Forerunner,
 and 
Furtherer
 of their future conversion.








CHAP. III. Of the Jews their repossessing their native Countrey.


§ 1. IT is a conceit of the modern 
Iews,
 that one day they shall return
under the conduct of their 
Messias
 to the Countrey of 
Canaan,
 and
City of 
Ierusalem,
 and be re-estated in the full possession thereof. If any ob∣ject,
that their land, now base, and barren, is not worth the regaining:
They answer, when they shall recover their Countrey, the Countrey
shall recover its former fruitfulness; as if God would effect miracles, as
fast as man can fancy them. With them concur some Protestant Divines,
maintaining, that the 
Iews
 shall be restored to a flourishing Common∣wealth,
with the affluence of all outward pomp, and pleasure, so that
they shall fight and conquer 
Gog
 and 
Magog
 [the Turke] with many
other miraculous achievements. One
 Author so enlargeth the future
amplitude of the Jewish State, that thereby he occasioned a confining to
himself. His expressions (indiscreetly uttered, or uncharitably constru∣ed)
importing, that all Christian Princes should surrender their power
as homagers to the temporall supreme Empire of the Jewish nation.


§ 2. For the proof of this their position, never did the servants of

Benhadad
 more 
diligently observe,
 or more 
hastily catch any
 
thing
 [of com∣fort]

coming from the mouth of Ahab,
 then the 
Iews
 search out, and snatch at
every gracious promise made to them in the old Testament. Such prin∣cipally
as 
Deut. 30. 3. Then
 [on their repentance] 
the Lord thy God will turn
thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return, and gather thee from
all nations, whiter the Lord thy God hath scattered thee. Isaiah 11. 12. And he
shall set up an Ensigne for the nations, and shall assemble the out-casts of Israel,
and gather together the dispersed of Iudah from the four corners of the earth.
Levit. 26. 44. And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will
not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break
my covenant with them, for I am the Lord their God.


§ 3. This last place the 
Iews
 highly price,
 and such of them as live in

Germany,
 call it
 
Simiam auream,
 or the 
Golden Ape.
 And why so? Because
(forsooth) in the Hebrew it begineth with 
, 
ve Ape, And yet.
 A frivo∣lous
conceit on the similitude of sound of two words, of different sense,
in the Hebrew, and Dutch tongues. Indeed, all the loud threatnings in
Scripture, may more fitly be termed 
Lions,
 all the meek promises therein,

Lambes;
 amongst which, this cited out of 
Leviticus
 is of especiall note,
whilest it is to be feared, such 
Iews
 (as found hence their temporall
kingdome) will prove themselves 
Apish
 in their ridiculous comment
thereupon.


§ 4. But,
 most learned Divines are of a contrary opinion, because
totall and finall desolation is in Scripture, so frequently denounced
against their Countrey, and Cities therein. 
The Virgin of Israel is fallen, she


shall
 
NO MORE rise; I will
 
NO MORE pity the inhabitants of the
land, and out of their enemies hand I will NOT deliver them: I will love them


 
NO MORE: The land shall fall, and
 
NOT rise again: I will break this
people and this City as a Potters vessell, which can
 
NOT be made whole again.


§ 5. As for the Scriptures alleadged by the 
Iews
 for their temporall
restauration to an illustrious condition in their own countrey, they
have found their full accomplishment,
 in the return of that nation, to
their own land, from the 
Captivity in Babylon;
 and therefore farther per∣formance
of such promises, is not to be expected: and accordingly it is
resolved in their own
 best Authors, 
Possessionem primam, & secundam habi∣turi
erant, possessio autem tertia non erit illis.
 And if any more fulfilling of
those promises remaineth behinde, it must be made up, in the sprirituall
conversion of the 
Iews,
 in Gods due time, to the knowledge of Christ,
and embracing of the Gospell. Some of their own
 writers affirming,
that 
all things which relate to the office of their Messiah
 (whom they expect)

are heavenly,
 and not corporall.


§ 6. The farther prosecution hereof,
 we leave to those Authors, who
have written large discourses of this subject. Onely we will observe a
remarkable difference betwixt a place of Scriputre, written in the Old,
alleadged, and applyed in the New Testament.


Amos 9. 11, & 12.
In that day will I raise up the Taber∣nacle
of David that is fallen, and close
up the breaches thereof, and I will raise
up his ruines, and I will build it as in the
days of old: That they may possess the
remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen,
which are called by my name, saith the
Lord that doth this.
Act. 15. 16, & 17.
After this I will return, and I will build
again the Tabernacle of David, which is fallen
down: and I will build again the ruines
thereof, and I will set it up: That the re∣sidue
of men might seek after the Lord,
and all the Gentiles upon whom my
name is called, saith the Lord who doth all
these things.

Here the Apostle 
Iames,
 more following the sense, then the words of the
Prophet, as an Expositor, rather then Translatour, renders the possessing
of the 
remnant of Edom,
 to be, by 
seeking after the Lord;
 by which Analogy
we collect, that those Topicall promises to the 
Iews,
 of their conquering
and possessing such, and such places, in, and near their own Countrey,
import onely a spirituall propriety, and shall mystically, not carnally be
accomplished, in their sincere conversion to Christ.


§ 7. More probable therefore it is,
 that the 
Iews
 shall not come back
to their land, but their land shall come back to them; I mean, those se∣verall
places, in 
Europe, Asia,
 and 
Africa,
 wherein they reside, shall on
their conversion, become as comfortable unto them, as ever the 
Land of
Canaan
 was to their Ancestors. 
Forti quaevis terra patria;
 and a contented
minde in them, shall make any mountain, their 
Olivet;
 river, their 
Ior∣dan;

field, their 
Carmel;
 forest, their 
Libanus;
 fort, their 
Zion;
 and city,
their 
Ierusalem.
 But, as for their temporall regaining of their old
Countrey, in all outward pompe, and magnificence, even such as are no
foes to the 
Iews
 welfare, but so fa
 friends to their own judgments, as not


to believe, even what they desire, till convinced with Scripture, or reason,
account this fancy of the 
Iews,
 one of the 
dreams
 proceeding from the

 
Spirit of slumber,
 wherewith the Apostle affirmeth them to be possessed.






CHAP. IIII. Of the generall calling of the Jews.


§ 1. BY 
Iews,
 we understand, some left of every Tribe (as
 formerly
hath been proved) being banished their own Countrey, since
the death of our Saviour; not extending it also (as some doe with
small probability) to the ten Tribes, carried captive by 
Shalmane
er,
 and
never since certainly known, where existent. By 
calling,
 we intend, their
reall converting by the word, to the knowledge and love of God in
Christ. By 
generall,
 we mean not every individuall 
Iew,
 whereof some
refractary Recusants will ever remain (were it but to be foiles to Gods
favour in saving the rest) but a considerable, yea conspicuous number
of them. And it is a charitable opinion, ancient, and conformable to
Scriptures, that in this sense, the 
Iews
 in Gods due time, shall be gene∣rally called.


§ 2.
 Come we now to the places of Scripture alleadged for the proof
of this opinion. Now as 
Mesha
 King of 
Moab,
 when his Countrey was
invaded, stood not the choosing of select souldiers for fight, but
 
gather∣ed
all that were able to put on armour, and upwards:
 so authors muster up all
places of Scripture, which put on any probability to this purpose, and
can carry any countenance thereunto, amongst many others, these en∣suing▪





Num. 24. 17.


Isa. 33. 17.


Ezek. 16. 61.


Mat. 23. 38.






Deut. 32. 43.


Isa 41. 15.


Ezek. 20. 34.


Mat. 24. 23.






Psal. 68. 22.


Isa. 43. 1. 
&c.


Ioel 2. 28.

Should these quotations be severally examined, many would be found
rather to perswade, then prove; rather to intimate, then perswade the
matter in hand: and that, onely to such free, and forward apprehensi∣ons,
as are prepossessed with the truth thereof. But, amongst these, and
many more numerous Scriptures cited, that one place 
Rom.
 11. 25.
principally deserveth our serious perusall thereof.


§ 3. The words of the Apostle run thus,
 
For I would not brethren that yee


should be ignorant of this mystery (le
t yee should be wise in your own conceits) that
blindness in part is hapned to Israel, untill the fulness of the Gentiles be come in, and
so all Israel shall be saved &c.
 This is conceived the strongest, and clearest
Charter for the 
Iews
 generall conversion▪


§ 4.
 It will be objected, that by 
all Israel
 the believing 
Gentiles
 are
meant (for Gods Church, being a collective body, of some 
Iews,
 and
moe 
Gentiles
) which in Scripture are styled
 
the children of Abraham,
 
the
Israel of God;
 
Iews inwardly, with circumcision of the heart, in the spirit, not the
letter.
 Yea, in the same verse, Saint 
Paul
 [a 
Iew
] called the 
Romans
 being

Gentiles, brethren,
 the kindred coming in by their regeneration: and in the
same sense, all converted 
Gentiles
 may be called 
Israel, whose praise is of God, and not of man.


§ 5.
 It is answered, allowing elsewhere in Scripture believing 
Gen∣tiles

to pass under the name of 
Israelites,
 here literally the naturall 
Iews
 by
extraction must be intended,



1 Because clean through the Chapter, the Apostle opposeth the

Gentiles
 and 
Israel,
 as contradistinct termes.


2 He acquainteth the 
Romans
 with a mystery, which was none in
effect (but stale news, and generally known) if onely the saving
of the 
Gentiles
 were therein intended.


3 It was his design, to comfort the 
Iews,
 and curbe the 
Gentiles,

from over-insulting on their sad condition.



And lest any should say slightingly to this opinion, as 
David
 once civilly
to 
Ittai,
 
Thou camest but yesterday;
 know, it descendeth unto us recom∣mended
from the Primitive times.


§ 6. 
Origen
 was the first that mentioned it,
 and h
 (otherwise the

Allegorizer Generall
) interprets the Apostle literally, in his exposition
thereof. Say not that being the first of the 
Fathers
 who wrote a Com∣ment,
no wonder if he wandred in his Glosses (he who first went from
place to place, never found out the nearest way) seeing better judgments
afterwards built on the same bottome, 
Hierom, Ambrose,
 
Chrysostome,
 and

 Saint 
Augustine.
 In the School-men the opinion of the 
Iews
 their con∣version,

is not dead, but sleepeth:
 Parables, and Prophesies, are no dishes
for their diet. Their heavy studies delighted not 
to tread the water
 (at best
the 
marishes) of future contingencies,
 but on the 
terra firma
 of certainties,
where arguments might be grounded. Yet the most peaceable amongst
them, (more medling with Comments, then Controversies) such is

Dionysius Carthusianus,
 concur in their judgments therein. But, the silence
of the 
Schools
 is recompensed with the loudness of the 
Pulpits
 in our later
age of
 
Romanists, Lutherans,
 and 
Calvinists,
 generally maintaining the cer∣tain
expectation of the 
Iews
 conversion.


§ 7. Adde hereunto, that the 
Iews
 ever since their exile from their
own land,
 when the 
Romans
 sold their Countrey, (and a learned
 man
observes, they set no land to sale save 
Iudea
 alone) have continued many


hundred years a distinct nation. As if had learned from their River
of 
Iordan,
 running through the 
Galilean Sea,
 and not mingling there∣with,
daily to pass through an Ocean of other nations, and remain an
unmixt, and un-confounded people by themselves. A comfortable pre∣sumption
(when in company with other arguments) that they, once

Gods
 
peculiar,
 are still preserved 
a peculiar people,
 for some 
token for good,
 in
due time to be shewed upon them; and that these 
materials
 are thus care∣fully
kept entire by themselves, because intended by Divine Providence,
for some 
beautifull building
 to be made of them hereafter.


§ 8. Let it also be seriously considered,
 that in all ages God hath
dropt some considerable convert-
Iews
 into the treasury of the Christian
Church, as 
good-handsell,
 and 
earnest
 of a greater payment to ensue. A∣mongst
whom we meet with a 
Mess
 of most eminent men. 
Nicolaus Lyra,

that grand Commentator on the Bible; 
Hieronymus de Sancta Fide
 turned
Chistian about 
Anno
 1412. (Physitian (as I take it) to 
Benedick
 the
thirteenth Pope) who wrote a book unto his Countrey-men the 
Iews,

wherewith
 five thousand of them were converted; 
Ludovicus Carettus

living
 in 
Paris Anno
 1553. and the never sufficiently to be praised 
Emma∣nuel
Tremellius.
 And besides the visible converts, falling uner the notice
of man, we may charitably presume many 
concealed ones,
 especially on
their death-beds known to God alone. Yea, I conceive that learned

 Rabbin, more then 
Agrippa
, 
almost a Christian,
 who hath this amongst
other pious expressions, 
I dread, and fear, O Lord, that that Iesus whom the
Christians worship, may be that righteous sold for silver, according to the Prophet

 Amos.


§ 9.
 As for the time of the 
Iews
 conversion, let us content our selves
for the generall, it shall be after 
the fulness of
 
the Gentiles shall come in.
 But,
for the particular year, by some so peremptorily, and positively assigned,
I cannot but admire at the confidence of men therein. Especially, seeing
some, which pretend such familiarity to future events, are not the best
acquainted with passages in former ages; and those, which seem to
know all which is to come, know but little of what is past; as if they
were the better Prophets, for being the worse Historians.


§ 10.
 But well it were, if their confidence were confined to
themselves alone, being onely content to 
abound in their own sense,
 without
imposing it on others. But, besides their confidence, such is their cruel∣ty,
to exact, yea, extort the 
uttermost farthing
 of our beliefe, to be paid in
(even at the 
first sight
) to their conceits, or else we must into 
the Prison,

yea, deepest 
dungeon,
 and be condemned for being weak, or wilfull; ig∣norant,
or obstinate. Whereas, in such peremptory particularizing of the
very year, such as pretend to 
plough with the heifers
 of Gods Spirit, may be
suspected to be drawn away with the 
wild buls
 of their own imagina∣tions.


§ 11.
 The rather, because so great the difference betwixt the severall


Dates assigned by them. Some making it 1652; others, 1660▪ Some
sooner, and before; some later, and after the destruction of the 
Romish
Antichrist.
 It is therefore the most safe, and sober way, in so much variety
to 
leave a blanke
 in our judgments, for God to write the true time therein,
when we, or after-ages shall behold the same brought to pass. 
One day
teacheth
 
another;
 and, 
to-day
 (yesterdays school-master) is scholar to

to-morrow,
 at whose feet (as 
Paul
 at 
Gamaliels
) it will at night 
it duti∣fully
down for farther informaton. Yea, by an inverted method, the

daughter doth instruct the mother;
 and, the day which in time cometh after,
goeth before in knowledge.






CHAP. V. Of the present obstructions of the calling of the Jews.


§ 1.
 MAny are the obstacles both externall, and internall, which for
the present obstruct the conversion of the 
Iews.
 First, our
want of civill society with their nation. There must be first conversing
with them, before there can be converting of them. The Gospell doth
not work (as the 
weapon-salve
) at distance, but requires some competent
familiarity with the persons of 
Probationer-converts.
 Whereas the 
Iews,
 be∣ing
banished out of 
England, France,
 and 
Spaine,
 are out of the call of the
Gospell, and ken of the Sacraments in those Countreys.


§ 2.
 Secondly, the cruel ussage of them in the 
Papall,
 and 
Imperiall
 do∣minions,
where they swarm most, and where publick authority doth
not endevour to drop, and distill piety into them; but to squeese, and
press profit out of them. Especially, whilest that merciless law stands in
force, that on their conversion, they must
 renounce all their goods as
ill gotten. If the resolutions of the promise-forward Disciple quickly re∣coyled,
at our Saviours tentative command, to 
sell all, and give to the poor;

I say, if 
he
 
went away sorrowfull, for he had great possessions;
 no wonder if the
rich and covetous 
Iews
 distast our Religion, when before they can em∣brace
it, they must take a finall farewell of their large estates. Rather
should those Princes imitate the pious example of our 
Henry
 the 
third,

who, between the 
new,
 and 
old Temple,
 erected an
 
house of Converts
 (after∣wards
appointed by 
Edward
 the 
third
 for Records to be kept therein, now
called 
the Rowles
) endowing it for the maintenance of poor 
Iews
 con∣verted
to Christianity, and baptized, allowing two pence
 a day unto
each of them during their lives.


§ 3.
 Thirdly, the constant offence given them by the 
Papists
 their wor∣shipping
of images, the present 
Iews
 hating Idolatry 
with a perfect hatred,

whose knees may sooner be broken, then bended to such superstitious
postures. And, to speak out the plain truth, the 
Romanists
 are but back∣friends
to the 
Iews
 conversion, chiefly on this account, because the 
Rabbins

generally interpret
 
Dumah,
 or 
Edom,
 to be 
Rome,
 and 
Edomites, Romans,
 in


their expositions on the old Testament. And therefore, all those passages
have (by order no doubt from Superiours) been lately purged our, and
expunged the 
Veneti
n
 edition of the 
Rabbins.
 Yea, there is a constant
tradition, currant time out of minde, amongst the modern 
Iews,
 that af∣ter
the destruction of the City of 
Rome,
 their nation shall be put into a
glorious condition. No wonder then, if cold, and dull the endevours
of the 
Romanists,
 for the conversion of the 
Iews,
 who leave that taske of be
performed by 
Moses,
 and 
Elias,
 whom the 
Papists
 fondly fancy, shall to∣wards
the end of the world personally appear, and by their powerfull
preaching, perswade the Jewish nation unto the Christian Religion.


§ 4.
 Lastly, the difference in judgments, distance in affections, disso∣luteness
in lives among the 
Christians
 themselves. In vain do we hollow
to the 
Iews
 to come over to us, whilest our voyces are hoarse with railing
one at another; and becken with our hands to them, to be on our side,
whilest our hands are imbrued in the bloud of those of our own religion.


§ 5.
 But far greater then all these, is that internall obstacle, that 
,
that 
blindness
 which 
is happened
 unto them, inflicted on their ancestours,
continued, and increasing on their posterity. How Bedlam-like was
their behaviour at Saint 
Pauls
 but mentioning of preaching to the 
Gen∣tiles,


 
They cryed out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the aire,
 as en∣devouring
to thicken, and condensate the same, that no audible sound
might penetrate unto them. And, as 
then
 they 
threw the dust into the aire:

God hath 
since
 thrown their land after it; so that no 
Iew
 can take up one
crum of dust, from any 
intire Countrey,
 upon the face of the earth, that
he can call his own. Great is Gods providence in ordering it, that a 
fog,

and a 
tempest
 never can be together at sea, the 
fog
 vanishing so soon as
the 
tempest
 ariseth, otherwise smaller vessels would be cast away, which
want the direction of the Compass to guide them: but woefull is the
present condition of the 
Iews,
 having a 
fog
 of 
ignorance,
 and a 
tempest
 of 
vio∣lence,

both together in them in the highest degree, most bold, when most
blind; stumbling at what should stay them; slighting the Chirurgeon,
when sorest; scorning the Physician, when sickest; miserable, if they
knew their condition; and more miserable, because ignorant thereof.


§ 6.
 But though these obstacles, and obstructions were moe, and
mightier then they are, should God but 
give the word,
 they are instantly
removed. Long was the service of the true God disused in 
Iudah
 (during
the idolatrous reign of 
Ahaz
) so that great was the difficulty, to bring
the whole nation to the solemn observation thereof. Yet, 
Hezekiah

quickly effected it, because (as the text observes)
 
God had prepared the
people, and the thing was done suddenly.
 So, when He shall be pleased to set
his hand to the 
Iews
 conversion, all impediments notwithstanding, in
the 
twinckling of an eye,
 their eies shall be opened; and their 
hearts turned,
 in
the turning of an hand.








Chap. VI. How Christians ought to behave themselves, in order
to the Jews conversion.


§ 1.
 MEan time it is the bounden duty of 
Christians,
 to their utmost
to endevour, both by their pious examples, and faithfull
prayers, the conversion of the 
Iews,
 having many motives to invite them
thereunto. First, because the more knowing, and pious in the 
Iew
sh
Church,
 did anciently desire the vocation of the 
Gentiles,
 witness the soli∣citous
care she took, and the great cost she would expend for the wel
a
e
thereof.
 
We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts, what shall we do for our
sister, in the day when she shall be spoken for? If she be a wall, we will build upon her
a palace of silver &c.
 For, although the common 
I
s
 accounted the cal∣ling
of the 
Gentiles,
 blasphemy against their own nation, (having some
carnall reason thereof, as not without cause suspicious, that the 
Gentiles

admission would prove their expulsion, as indeed it came to pass) yet
the intelligent Prophets (no doubt) were earnest petitioners for the same.


§ 2.
 Secondly, because such was the transcendent joy of the godly

Iews,
 managed with silence (their hearts thereat being too big for their
mouths) at the conversion of 
Cornelius,
 and his family;
 
When they heard
these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to
the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.


§ 3.
 Lastly, because so great glory shall, by the conversion of the 
Iews,

redound to God, and clearing to the Scriptures. Many places in the old
Testamen
 (the meaning whereof, the 
Iews
 hitherto were too envious to
teach us, or we too proud to learn of them) will then most plainly be
expounded. Oh! what a feast of knowledge will it make, when both

Iew
 and 
Gentile
 shall jointly bring in their dis
es thereunto! The former
furnishing forth the first course with many Hebrew Criticismes, and
Rabbinicall Traditions (some of them gold amongst more dross) on
the old Testament: the latter supplying the second course on the whole
Scripture, with solid▪ interpretations, out of Fathers, School
men, and
Modern Divines. Oh happy day for such as shall behold it, and we all
ought to pray for the speedy dawning thereof!


§ 4.
 It will be objected, many men cannot heartily pray for the fu∣ture
conversion of the 
Iews;
 being unsatisfied in their judgments, of the
certainty thereof▪
 
For whatsoever is not of faith is sin;
 and because they can∣not
aske according to the Apostles precept
 
 prayers
are better omitted, as which may prove prejudiciall to themselves, and
nothing effectuall for others.


§ 5.
 It is safest for such to insert conditionall clauses in their prayers,

If it may stand with Gods good will and pleasure,
 used by the best men (not to
say the best
 in bests) in their petitions:
 
Lord if thou wilt▪ thou canst make


me clean.
 Such wary reservations will not be interpreted in the Court of
Heaven, want of faith, but store of humility, in such particulars where
such persons have no plenary assurance of Gods pleasure. Yea, grant the
worst, that God never intended the future conversion of the 
Iews,
 yet
whilst he hath not revealed the contrary (as in the case of 
Samuels
 mour∣ning
for 
Saul
) all mens charitable desires herein, cannot but be acceptable
to the God of heaven.


O Lord
 who art
 righteous in all thy ways,
 and holy in all thy
works, 
we acknowledge, and admire the justice of thy proceedings, in
blinding, and hardening the
 Jews; 
as for their manifold impieties; so
especially for stoning thy Prophets, despising thy Word, and crucifying
the Lord of
life. For which thou hast caused them, according to the prediction of thy
 
Prophet, to

abide many days without a King, and without a Prince, and without
a Sacrifice, and without an Image, and without an Ephod, and without
Teraphim. But thou ô Lord how
 long? How
 ô Lord holy and
true? How
 long Lord, with thou be angry for ever? Thine anger 
is said
 to
endure but a
 Moment, 
but Lord how many Millions of Millions of Moments,
are contained in sixteen hundred years, since thou hast first cast off thy first and ancient
people the
 Jews? 
Remember
 Abraham, Isaac, 
and
 Jacob, 
not for any merit in
their persons, which was none, but for the mercy in thy promises, which is infinite, so
frequently made, and so solemnly confirmed unto them. But oh! remember the Oratour
on thy right hand,
 Christ Jesus 
our
 Lord,
 which was made of the seed of
David according to the flesh, 
and the Oratour in thine own bosome, thine essenti∣all
and innate Clemency, and let these prevaile, if it may stand with thy good will, and
pleasure, that thy people the
 Jews 
may be received into the armes of thy mercy. As
once by a wilfull, and wofull imprecation they drew the guilt of his
 bloud on
 them
and on their children: 
so by thy free imputation drop the merit of his
 bloud on
them, and on their children. 
For the speedying of whose conversion, be pleased
to compose the many different judgments of
 Christians 
into one truth, to unite their
disagreeing affections in one love, that our examples may no longer discourage, but in∣vite
them to the embracing of the true Religion. Oh mollifie the hearts, rectifie the
wills, unvaile the eyes, unstop the ears of those thy people whom hitherto thou hast
justly hardened. Reveale to their understanding those
 Oracles 
which thou hast
committed to their keeping. That so our Saviour, who long since hath been
 a light to
lighten the Gentiles,
 
may in thy time be
 the glory of thy people Israel, 
that
so there may be
 one
 shepheard and one sheepfold. 
Grant this
 ô Lord 
for

Christ Jesus 
his sake, to whom, with
 Thee, 
and the
 Holy Spirit, 
be all honour
and glory, now, and forever, Amen.

Fragmenta Sacra.




















Necessary directions for the use of the
INDEX.


AN Index is the 
bag and baggage
 of a book, of more use then honour, even
such who seemingly slight it, secretly using it, if not for 
need,
 or 
speed
 of
what they desire to finde. Our Table, for the better expedition, is contrived
into severall Columnes; The first presenting the names of Scripture places within
the land of 
Palestine.
 If any literall difference appear (not onely such as betwixt

Zidon, Kidron,
 in the Old; 
Siden,
 and 
Cedron,
 in the New Testament, but) concer∣ning
the same place diversly written, the discretion of the Reader wil easily re∣concile
it. Immediately after the name the addition of C. donoteth 
City,
 F. 
Field,

L. 
Land,
 M. 
Mountain,
 Pl. 
Plain,
 Ri. 
River,
 Ro. 
Rock,
 S. 
Stone,
 St. 
Station
 of the

Iews
 in the Wilderness, T. 
Town,
 V. 
Vaile,
 We. 
Well,
 Wi. 
Wilderness.


The second Column interprets the Hebrew names into English, though great the
variety of Authors in rendring their signification. This party proceeds from the
laxity of Hebrew words admitting sundry senses, partly from the vicinity of Primi∣tives,
so that the same derivative may seem to spring from two 
roots,
 and be 
son
 (as

directly
 to his 
Father,
 so) 
collaterally
 to his 
Vncle,
 I mean to words 
akin,
 and 
alluding,

whence the same in probability may be deduced; and this subjecteth it to much
variety of interpretation. In this diversity we have wholly followed 
Gregorius Gre∣gorii

in his 
Lexicon Sacrum
 (as a work meerly expository of proper nams) though
some perchance will say, that what is the credit of the good wife
 
she bringeth her
food from far,
 is sometimes his discredit in his over strained, and far fet derivations.


Expect not here from me, after the meaning of the name, a reason of the meaning,
how conformable to the nature of the place. Many Townes were called so, be∣cause
they were called so, 
ad placitum
 of the first imposer. Other places, when first
denominated, had just reason of the same, but this 
kernell
 long since hath been eaten
up by all-devouring time, leaving nothing thereof but the 
huske
 of the empty name
to posterity. Now to fix the Hebrew names the better in our memory, we have
here, and there (as the propriety of our language, and commodities of our Countrey
will admit) inserted some English Townes, as 
Synonyma's,
 and parallel to the Hebrew
in signification.


The fourth Column is reserved for those texts of Scripture, wherein is made,
either the 
first,
 or 
most important
 mention of those plces. As the fifth exhibits the
Map wherein the same are to be found.


The sixth tenders to the Reader the 
Longitudes
 of most places, and the rest may
be supplied by proportion. But oh, the difference of best Authors herein! As in
populous Cities an 
houre
 is lost in measuring of time, the 
lag clock
 about noon
striking 
the most,
 when the 
forwardest
 strikes 
the fewest:
 so a whole degree of 
Lon∣gitude

is swallowed up betwixt the difference of Geographers. Yea, so great is the
uncertainty therein, that in most Maps 
lines of Longitudes
 (as onely for generall di¦rection,

ne toto coelo errent
) serve to 
lace
 their Maps that they grow not without

forme,
 or 
fashion;
 but are not reducible to an exact agreement.


More is the certainty of 
Latitudes
 the work of the next Column, as greater their
concernment in our Description, because effectuall in the length of the days, and
heat of the climate in 
Palestine.
 It is situated for the main betwixt 
thirty one
 and 
thirty
four,
 the longest day being 
fourteen houres, and a quarter;
 though the 
Iews
 (as if it
were always 
Equinoctiall
 with them) divided both day and night evenly into twelve


houres, so that the two overplus houres and the quarter, fell under the nocturnall
computation.


As for the climate of 
Palestine,
 in summer time it must needs be hot, lying not
above 
seven degrees
 from the 
Tropick,
 especially when the
 
south winde blew▪
 But
sometimes God cooled them, by drawing betwixt the Sun and them a Canopy, or

 
Cloud of Dew in the heat of harvest.
 Their winter, though short, was sharp;
 
Who
is able to abide his frosts?


Now although such their vicinity to the Sun (lying at the same distance with
some parts of 
Barbary,
 where the people are tawny) yet the
 (their women
especially) were of fair complexion. Indeed, though the 
setting of the Fa
 be the
same, all stuffes take not 
die
 alike. Besides, that the 
able faces of 
Black-mores
 come
not from the Sun, but some other secret cause, plainly appears, because 
Ebony

and 
Ivory,
 I mean, black and fair faces are found in parallel Climates.


The last Column containes the Book, Page, and Paragraph (save that the fifth
book is divided onely into Chapters) where any memorable mention is made of such places in our Description. Places out of the Apocrypha, and humane writers
we have omitted, which by their own
 markes will soon insinuate themselves into
the Readers acquaintance, without any farther indication.

REader, be pleased to take notice, that limitary places, and all other mentioned in
Scripture, which we could not confidently refer to another 
Letter,
 are by us (though
no 
Townes
) consigned to T. which as an 
Hospitall,
 of no less charity, then capacity, gives
them all entertainment. And thus by Gods assistance we have finished our Table. Mi∣raculous
almost was the execution done by 
David
 on the 
Amalekites,
 who 
saved neither
man
 
nor woman alive to bring tidings to Gath.
 I cannot promise such exactness in our
Index, that no one Name hath escaped our enquiry: some few, perchance, hardly slip∣ping
by, may 
tell tales
 against us. This I profess I have not (in the language of some
modern 
Quarter-Masters
) wilfully 
burnt any Towns,
 and purposely omitted them; and
hope, that such as have escaped our discovery, will upon examination appear; either,
not generally agreed on by Authors for 
Proper Names,
 or else, by proportion falling
without the bounds of 
Palestine.


Soli Deo gloria.
