A New-Years-Gift To the Honourable Admiral Russel, On his 
Glorious Victory
 over the 
French Fleet.




LOng did the Languishing 
Brittania
 grown


Beneath 
French
 Power on the 
English
 Throne!


French
 Councills, 
French
 Debauch'ry rul'd the Rost,


And gen'rous 
English
 Courage quite was lost.


Blake, Deane,
 and 
Lawson,
 whose each single Name,


Without an 
Epithet,
 swells the 
Cheeks of Fame;


England
's brave Hero's, who disdain'd to Bear


The 
Romish
 Yoak, or 
Gallic
 Fetters wear;


Who all the 
Naval
 Power of 
Europe
 Sway'd,


And sturdy 
Algerines
 their Laws obey'd:


Loaden with glory, 
These
 their Lives resign,


And their lov'd Names in Fames bright Annals shine.


Great 
Ruport,
 and brave 
Monk
 a while Support


The 
English
 Valour, since made 
Europes
 sport,






With these fell th' Honour of our English Fleet,


Degenerate Souls 
Degenerous
 acts commit!


Soft 
Daliance
 now 
Emasculates
 the Land,


Old
 Captains laid aside, and 
Boys
 Command;


For 
Balls
 and 
Masquerades
 highly renown'd,


And 
Tilting
 Beedles in their Midnight-round;


Effeminate
 Courts 
Effeminate
 Youths employ,


These keep not up our glory, but destroy.


An 
English King
 Mannag'd by 
Bourillion,


Is a fit 
Tool
 t'advance the 
Gallic
 Throne!




Thus 
We
 who gave the boundless Ocean Law,


And our Confederate Neighbours kept in 
Awe,


Scorn'd
 and despis'd like 
Abjects,
 were become


Slaves
 to the 
French,
 and 
Proselites
 to 
Rome.






At length Great 
Brittains
 better Genius saw,


The heavy Yoak her 
Sons
 were forc't to draw,


And with 
Compassion
 touch'd the 
Generous Nassaw.


Nassaw
 the Darling of Heav'ns kinder Powers,


Our 
Native Freedom
 to our 
Isle
 Restores;


Like the 
First Kings
 or Chiefs, with Courage stout,


He to the Battel leads his 
Captains
 out,


In hottest Actions 
Foremost
 he appears,


Nor shuns the 
Combat
 check'd by 
Guilty Fears,


His 
Martial
 Heat th' Old 
English
 Courage warms,


Rais'd, and 
Revives
 the Credit of her 
Arms:


From 
Rav'nous Lewis
 he a 
Kingdom
 tore,


Forc'd him his 
Boasted Ireland
 to Restore,


And drove his baffled Troops home to their slavish Shoar,


With winged Force pursues him on the Main,


And checks the Progress of his 
Grand Campain;


Whilst shifting 
Luxemburgh
 in Entrenchments hides


His sneaking Troops, and 
Fastnesses
 proyides:


His vaunting Squadrons dares not ours engage,


But dread the shock of Conq'ring 
Nassaw
's Rage;


The Battel of the glorious Field they shun,


And avoiding Fighting, may be said to 
Run.






Brave 
England
's King, who knows not to b' affraid,


Hath all the 
Daring
 Stratagems essaid,


But all in vain, since the 
Inglorious French,


Fearful of Vengeance, meanly do Entrench.




Honour
 and 
Arms
 Great 
Orange
 Nobly Courts,


Lewis
 to Treacherous 
Poisonings
 Resorts;


Conscious, when those his hellish 
Arts
 shall fail,


He ne're can by his 
Guilty
 Arms prevail.






On the 
French
 Conquests now our Monarch stands,


And makes them Tributary to our Bands,


With 
English
 Troops 
Dunkirk
 in Pound he keeps,


And betwixt 
Lewis
 and his 
Dunkirk
 sleeps;


Dunkirk
 that's lodg'd in 
Lewis
's panting Breast,


As of her 
Callais Mary
 once exprest:


Dunkirk
 before, by 
English
 Valour ta'ne,


And for 
French
 Pistols basely Sold again:


Great 
William
's Sword must now the Knot untie,


And regain by 
Arms
 what 
France
 with 
Gold
 did buy:






Whilst our great King, on Land, such 
Glories
 meet,


To 
You
 he leaves the Conduct of his 
Fleet;


You
 who have laid fresh Lawrels at his Feet.


Russel
 before 
England
's Respects might Claim


For a 
Champion,
 and a 
Martyr
 of that Name,


You more a Debtor have your Country made,


And rais'd that 
Fund
 of Honour they had laid.


True to the Trust the 
Royal Pair
 Repos'd,


Their Interest and their Kingdoms 
You
 espous'd.






The first Years Expedition spent in vain,


Hunting for 
Tourvill
 on the Foaming Main;


That blustring Monsieur, who the Year before


Show'd his great 
French Armada
 on our Shoare,


Burning five 
Fisher-Boats,
 durst attempt no more.


At Land, and Sea the 
French
 like Courage show,


With equal 
Force
 they dare not see their 
Foe.




The 
English
 Navy o're the Ocean Rides,


Proud of that glorious Burthen on her Tides.


With Indignation scowres the Channel Round,


But neither 
Tourvil
 nor his 
Fleet
 were found;


Our eager Youth near mad with Martial Rage,


Hunting a Foe they could not come t' engage;


Perplext, and Raving, scarcely they forbear,


With violent Hands their very flesh to tear.


Mean while our 
Heroe
 with great pain supprest


The burning 
Indignation
 in his Breast,


He forc't his swelling 
Passion
 to obey,


And for the next 
fit time
 for Vengeance stay.


Kind Heav'n 
agreed,
 and with a wisht for gale


Upon our 
Fleet
 this year drove fifty Sail,


Their warm Reception quickly made them know,


They now in earnest met a generous Foe,


Would try their Courage e're they'd let 'em go.


With pompous Rage the 
Admirals Admirals
 meet;


Ours glad they'd 
found
 at last, the 
Gallic
 Fleet,


And whatsoe're detracting French-men say,


But 
Forty
 of our Ships could come in play;


Th' unequal Odds our 
Captains
 scorn to shun,


The 
Lesser
 Number 
Greater
 Glory won.


With Peals of Joy our Men the Welkin tear,


And with 
presaging
 Huzza's cleave the Aire,


Glorie's
 their aim, and that they close pursue,


With warmth the 
French
 were unaccustom'd too.


Stout 
Carter
 who too early lost a Thigh,


With his last Breath did still the Foe defie;




He saw himself 
Reveng'd
 e're he expir'd,


And to the bed of 
Glory
 strait retir'd.






Through gusts of Thunder 
bright Brittania's
 hurld.


To 
d the 
Mistress
 of the 
Wat'ry World,


She whom vain-glorious 
Lewis
 built to sway


The 
Ocean,
 as the 
Land,
 must him 
obey;


M
 
h
 the 
Omen
 of his 
Fortune
 be,


And his 
Arms
 at Land succeed as those at 
Sea!


Resolved 
Russel
 storms her lofty sides,


Humbles the vaunting 
Motto
 of her pride,


All heat, all indignation, peals of Fire


Break from his roaring tyres, the affrighted Air


Trembling and wounded, to the 
French
 Coast flies,


And Eccho's out their 
Navy's
 Obsequies.






Tourvill,
 with warmth not seen in 
French
 before


Receives the broad-sides which our Cannons poure,


He all his 
Force,
 and all his 
Skill
 apply'd


To keep Victorious 
Russel
 from his side,


But all in vain, 
Englands
 Brave 
Admiral
 knew


The 
Oceans Soverainty
 was 
Englands
 due;


Close to the Monsieurs fiery sides he bore,


And with fresh Thunder 
Storms
 him o're and o're;


Their Murthering Ball thick as their hail shot flew,


And ev'ry broad-side doth their rage renew;


With Fire 
Brittania
 clouds the 
Rising Sun,


And in flaming Circles on his 
Orb
 doth run,


Arm-yard to Arm-yard closely they Engage,


And in loud roaring vollies tell their Rage;


Ne're on the 
Sea
 was greater bravery shewn,


Nor Honours prize with greater Glory won.




After 
Five Hours
 dispute in Smoaky Clouds,


Storming of 
Hulls,
 Rending of Sinwey 
Shrouds,


With all the Horrid pomp a 
Naval
 Fight


Could e're present, or Scaly Squadrons 'fright;


The 
Rising Sun
 sinks in the Watry deep,


And his 
Shining Glories
 in her 
Waves
 doth steep.


Th' 
Immortal Palme You
 Mighty Sir have won,


And have 
Eclipst
 proud 
Lewis
's Rising 
Sun.






So have I seen in a disturbed Air


Two Sable Clouds meeting from Regions far,


Grown big with Tempests, at each other Flash,


'Till their loud Storms have made Heav'ns vault to crash,


Their Fires meet, and 
Combat
 in the Sky,


And 
Bellow
 out their 
Thunders
 from on High,


Disgorging Flame, as if the Globe they'd burn,


And 
Earths Foundations
 into Ashes turn;


Their 
Sulph'rous Store
 being spent, they melt in showers,


And Rapid Torrents from the Mountains poure:


In 
Lightning
 they begin, in 
Rain
 Expire,


And 
Neptunes
 Flood Extinquisht 
Vulcans
 Fire.


Nor did your 
Captains
 little 
Bravery
 shew,


They signalliz'd their Courage on the foe,


Your
 great Example did their Spirits Raise;


Each Fought for, and deserv'd a Conquerers Bays.


Your Master,
 on the 
Land,
 his Troops Inspires,


At 
Sea You
 Animate with your Martial Fires.


Three mighty Ships into the Air were blown,


Monsieurs flew 
capering
 up, came 
tumbling
 down:


The rest o'th' shatter'd Fleet make to 
La-Hogue,


And seek 
Protection
 from St. 
Patrick
's 
Brogue;




Lillie-Boliero's,
 who their 
Country
 lost,


Were now made 
Guardians
 of the 
Norman
 Coast,


These saw their 
Burning
 Squadrons in the 
Bay,


On their 
own Coasts
 their Ships became 
our
 prey.






Boast not of 
Mons,
 by Treacherous Priests 
betray'd,


Nor 
Namur
 which the 
Floods
 thy 
Captive made!


Whilst 
Heav'n
 with faint 
Te Deums Lewis mocks,


And with 
False
 Tryumphs 
buoys
 his senceless 
Stocks,


On his own Shoar his 
Flaming Flota
 lies,


To the 
English Admiral
 a 
Sacrifice:


Brave 
Russel
 scorns his 
Glorious King
 to greet


With a less 
Bonfire
 than the 
Gallic Fleet.






Methinks I see the King of the great Deep


With all his Trytons Halcyon Revels keep,


Glad their 
Right Lords
 Resume their Ancient sway;


Swearing Allegiance to 
Brittannia.


The 
Syrens
 our 
Brittania's
 Tryumphs sing,


And in Shells of Pearl Quaf Healths to 
Brittains King,


The joyful 
Sea Gods
 pledge the Bumper round,


And with shril whistles make the 
Sea
 resound.


Stave a French-prize,
 quoth 
Neptune,
 and Advance


A Health to 
England
 in the Wine of 
France;


That Conqu'ring 
Heroe
 shall their Topsails Lower,


And 
Tributary France
 shall own 
his
 Power;


Annals to come shall with 
his
 Conquests swell,


Turky,
 and 
India
 shall 
his
 Tryumphs tell.


To the 
Levant,
 and 
Ʋtmost East
 then Fly,


And tell each 
Port
 this Glorious 
Victory,


This said they all Obey'd.








But more 
substantial Votes
 att
nd 
 
aise,


Caesar,
 the 
Senate,
 and the 


Eternal 
Trophies
 to their 
Admirals
 Name,


Shall equalize the longest date of Fame.


So the 
Old Romans,
 when their 
Generals
 prove,


By brave 
Exploits,
 worthy their 
Country's
 love;


Raise 
Obelisks,
 and 
Statues
 to make known


The 
Victories,
 and 
Battels they
 had won.






When future 
Parliaments
 shall come to Note


In their Records our 
August Senates
 Vote,


With what 
Ʋnanimous consent
 they own


The 
Courage, Conduct, Faith
 your zeal hath shewn:


Restor'd
 its former Glory to our 
Isle,


And of a 
Navy
 made a 
Funeral Pile;


This in times Callendar shall far surpass


The 
Roman Marble,
 or 
Corinthian Brass.


'Tis 
Englands Thanks
 that are acknowledg'd due


By her great 
Representatives
 to you!


May no 
Invidious Vermine
 ever tear


That sacred 
Vellom,
 let it always bear


To future times the 
Mighty things
 you've done,


And an 
obliged Kingdoms
 praise have 
won.


May 
pale
 and 
Trecherous Envy
 ever hide


Her 
guilty head;
 whilst still each flowing Tyde


Shall waft fresh Tryumphs to 
great Russel
's Name,


And far as th' Ocean Rowls your 
high desert
 Proclaim.
