victuals, or of armes, or of munition or other such like materials for the Warres, be carried by the Subiects, Vassals, or Inhabitants of those Kingdomes, to the commoditie or be∣nefit of the enemies of the one or other King. And whosoeuer shall attempt to the contra∣rie, shall bee punished with those sharpe paines and punishments, vsed to be inflicted vpon seditious persons and breakers of Faith and Peace. Prouided also, that the Subiects of the one, in the Dominions and Territo∣ries of the other, be not worse handled, then the naturall Subiects in their sales and con∣tracts for their Merchandises, as wel in respect of the prises, as otherwise, but that the Con∣dition of Forreiners be equal and like herein, vnto natural Subiects: Notwithstanding any Statutes or Customes to the contrarie.






XI.


ITem, it is agreed and accorded, that the most renowned King of 
England, Scotland &c.
 shall prohibite, and after the confir∣ming of these present Articles, by Proclama∣tion forthwith prouide, that no one of his

Subiects, Inhabitants, or Vassals shall lade, or carie ouer by any meanes directly, or indi∣rectly in his owne name, or in the name of any others, neither shall lend his Ship or o∣ther vessell for carriage, or vse his name for the transporting or conueying of any Ships, Merchandises, Manufactures, or any other thing, out of 
Holland,
 and 
Zeland
 into 
Spaine,
 or other the Kingdomes and Domi∣nions of the King of 
Spaine,
 or the Arch∣dukes, neither shall carrie in his Ships, any 
Holland,
 or 
Zeland
 Merchant vnto the said Ports, vpon perill of his Maiesties indignati∣on, and other punishments vsually inflicted on the contemners of his Highnesse com∣mandements. And to the effect that fraude (which through the likenesse of Merchan∣dise might happen) bee the better auoyded: It is also prouided in this present Article, that the Merchandises to be carried, and conuey∣ed out of 
England, Scotland,
 and 
Ireland,
 to the Kingdomes and Dominions of the King of 
Spaine
 and Archdukes, shall bee Registred and Sealed with the Seale of the Towne or Citie from whence they shall bee laden, and

that they being so Registred and Sealed, shal without any difficultie or question whatsoe∣uer, bee reputed, and held for English, Scot∣tish, and Irish Merchandises, and so respec∣tiuely according to the Seale or Marke, bee allowed and admitted: Alwayes excepted, that in case of fraude, proofe shall be admit∣ted, without stay notwithstanding or let of the course or venting of the Merchandises in the meane time: And touching such Mer∣chandises, as shall not be Registred nor Sea∣led, the same are to bee Confiscated and ta∣ken for good Prize: And likewise all 
Hollan∣ders
 and 
Zelanders,
 which shall bee found in the same Ships, may also bee taken and de∣tained.

 and other of the Kingdomes of the King of 
Spaine,
 (before mentioned) without the payment of the Im∣position of thirtie in the hundred, lately im∣posed;

but paying onely the Custome and Tolles vsually required, before the said Im∣position of thirtie in the hundred.






XIII.


ITem, it is likewise agreed, that for the Mer∣chandises. which English, Scottish, and Irish Merchants shall buy in 
Spaine,
 or o∣ther the Kingdomes of the sayd King of 
Spaine,
 and shall carrie in their owne Ships, or in Ships hired, or lent vnto them (except as before hath bene said the Ships of 
Hollan∣ders
 and 
Zelanders
) they shall pay onely such Tolles as were accustomed to bee paide before the Imposition of thirtie in the hun∣dred, yet so as they conuey and carrie the same goods and Merchandises to the King∣domes of the said most renowned King of 
England, Scotland &c.
 or to the Ports of the Prouinces, being in obedience to the Arch∣dukes. And for the more suretie that fraude bee not committed herein, and that the said Merchandises bee not transported to other places and Kingdomes, and especially into 
Holland
 or 
Zeland,
 it is concluded, that the

said Merchants shall binde themselues, at the time that they doe lade their Ships in 
Spaine,
 or in the other Kingdomes and Dominions of the said King of 
Spaine
 aboue declared, be∣fore the Magistrate of the place in which they shall lade, to pay the said Imposition of thir∣tie in the hundred, in case they carrie the same goods and Merchandises to other Do∣minions and Countries: And to obtaine also within the space of twelue moneths follow∣ing, a Certificate from the Magistrate of the places, where they shall discharge or vnlade the same goods, testifying their discharge to haue beene either in the Kingdomes and Do∣minions of the King of 
England &c.
 or in the Ports of the Prouinces vnder the obedience of the said Archdukes: vpon the exhibiting whereof, the Obligations concerning those matters shall be deliuered vp, vnto the brin∣gers of the same Certificates.






XIIII.


ANd also that the sayd most renowned King of 
England, Scotland, France
 and 
Ireland,
 &c. shall prohibite soone af∣ter

the confirming of this accord, that none shall exporte any merchandize out of 
Spaine,
 or other Kingdomes of the King of 
Spaine,
 to be caried to other places then to his Ma∣iesties Kingdomes, and the sayd Portes of 
Flanders,
 vpon penaltie of confiscation of all their merchandises, to the vse of the said King of 
England,
 &c. to be paide into his Ma∣iesties Exchequer: of which merchandises, or the value thereof, one halfe is to bee giuen to the Informer, (the imposition of thirtie in the hundred being first deducted) to bee payed to the Ministers and Deputies of the King of 
Spaine,
 and the proofes lawfully re∣ceiued in 
Spaine,
 and transmitted into 
Eng∣land
 in authenticall fourme, are to bee cre∣dited.






XV.


ITem, that the Magistrates of the sayde townes or Cities of his Maiesties King∣domes, which shall make Certificates of the vnlading of shippes, and are to giue te∣stimony of the registring of the merchandi∣ses, shal not commit any fraud therein, vnder

perill of indignation of the Kings Maiestie, and paine of losse of their offices, and other more grieuous punishments at the Kings pleasure. This declaration being added, that when the King of 
Spaine
 and Arch∣dukes shall agree with the French King, or with any other vpon the last Placard of thirty in the hundred, and the Commerce betwixt them be restored, then it shall bee lawfull to the Subiects of the sayd most re∣nowned King of 
England, Scotland,
 &c. to transport their merchandises to the King∣domes and Dominions of him, or them vnto whom Commerce shall be restored without the payment of thirty in the hundred, but onely paying the Tolles and Customes vsed and payed before the sayd imposition.






XVI.


THat which hath before been expressed, concerning the free Commerce gran∣ted vnto the Subiects of the said renow∣ned kings, is to be vnderstood to bee like∣wise agreed on, for the Subiects of the most renowned King & Princes, the king of 
Eng∣land,

Scotland, France
 and 
Ireland,
 &c. and the Archdukes, to wit, that in all places whatsoe∣uer, their Subiects are bound reciprocally, to respect & to fauour ech other, and by mutu∣all kinde offices friendly to intertaine the one the other, and that by land, sea, and fresh waters, without any safe conduct or other licence generall or speciall, they may vnto the saide Kingdomes, Dominions, Lands, Villages, Towns, Cities, Sea shores, Hauens, Sea rodes whatsoeuer, freely, safely, securely, come, enter, sayle, carie and recarie their mer∣chandises, buy, and sell, remaine, abide, and conuerse in the same, so long as it shall please them, any kinde of prouision for victuall, and things necessary for sustenance, and for voiages at iust & reasonable prices, and there repaire also (as occasion shall require) their shipping, and cariages, whether the same be their owne, or whether they be hired or bor∣rowed: As also to depart from thence with like libertie, with merchandises, goods, and other things whatsoeuer (the Customes and Tolles according to the Statutes of those pla∣ces being payd) and to dispose and follow

their businesses freely, and to returne at their owne pleasure, either into their owne Coun∣treys, or to any other place, without any impediment or let, so as the Subiects of the most renowned King of 
England,
 &c. vse not the shipping of the Hollanders, or the vnited Prouinces, and bring not into the Prouinces of the Archdukes any of the manufactures of 
Holland,
 or of the vnited Prouinces bought wheresoeuer, neither any other thing, for which there was paid in 
Holland
 any tribute, nor that they transport any thing from the Archdukes Prouinces, vnto them of those Prouinces vntill a pacification be accorded: Nor that they receiue any the goods or Hol∣landers, or of those other places vnited into their ships, nor trust any of their owne goods in the ships of Hollanders, nor fraudulently by lending their names, colour the goods of any Hollander, or other of the vnited Prouin∣ces: for that if any thing be committed to the contrary, and the same be found, it shall bee held for iust and lawfull Price.








XVII.


ANd the aforesaid Prouisoes are not only to bee vnderstood of ships laden or to be laden in cause of Commerce, but also of shippes of Warre which the said Princes haue or shall haue armed to represse the At∣tempts of their Enemies: insomuch as that it may be lawfull for such Ships of warre, not exceeding the number before mentioned, if they happen to be constrained either by force of tempest, or for buying of Victuals or other things, or for repaire of shipping, to vse the same libertie in arriuing, staying, and depar∣ting: so that they doe no Hostile acte in the said Ports, but demeane themselues honest∣ly and quietly, as it becommeth confederates and friends: and so that they stay and re∣maine not in, or about the same Ports any longer then shall bee needfull for reparation and prouision of necessaries, that thereby they be not a hinderance or interruption to the free Commerce and Entercourse with o∣ther Nations that are in Amitie and Friend∣ship: but where occasion shall fall out of ar∣riuall

of any greater number of Shipping then before specified, it shall not bee lawfull for them to enter, but with the knowledge and allowance of the Prince.






XVIII.


ANd as the saide Kings and Archdukes doe religiously promise, that they will not at any time yeeld any Warlike suc∣cour to any of the others enemies, so it is pro∣uided that their Subiects, or the inhabitants in their Realmes, of what nation or qualitie soeuer they be, may not vnder colour of En∣tercourse and Commerce, nor vpon any o∣ther colour or pretence giue any ayde or helpe to the enemies of the sayd Princes, or of either of them, or conferre, or supplie them with money, prouisions of victuals for warre, Amour, Municion, Ordinance, Artillerie, or other warlike prouision, and those which shall do the contrary, are to take knowledge, that they shall bee punished with the seuere punishments accustomed to be inflicted vp∣on breakers of League, and seditious per∣sons.








XIX.


AND that also greater benefite may through this Concord come vnto the Subiects of the most renowned King of 
England, Scotland, &c.
 and of the Arch∣dukes, it is accorded and concluded, that the said most renowned King of 
England, &c.
 and Archdukes ioyntly and seuerally, will doe their endeuours, that their Subiects haue not the passages stopped or letted vnto any of their Ports, Kingdomes and Dominions, that thereby they bee not hindered, freely and without impediment to come and goe, with their Shipping, Merchandise, and Car∣riages (the ordinarie Customes and Tolles being paide) to al the said Ports, Kingdomes, and Dominions: and with the like libertie (when it shall seeme so good vnto them) with other Merchandises from thence to depart.






XX.


BVt as concerning the ancient Treatises of entercourse and Commerce, whereof di∣uers are extant, betwixt the Kingdomes

of 
England, Scotland,
 and 
Ireland,
 and the Dominions of the Dukes of 
Burgundie,
 and Princes of the Low Countreyes, which not∣withstanding during the late troubles haue beene intermitted, and peraduenture in some parts impaired; it is agreed by way of proui∣sion, That they shall retaine and haue their auncient forte and authoritie, and that they shall bee vsed on both parts, as they were be∣fore the Warres: And if it happen that ei∣ther by both partes or any one part any breach thereof be alleadged, or that the Sub∣iects shall complaine that the Conuentions are not obserued, or that more grieuous bur∣dens then were accustomed are imposed on them, there shall bee Deputies appointed on either part which may meete, and calling vn∣to them (if neede be) Merchants experienced in such matters, may friendly Treate, and e∣qually renew, and restore such things, as shal bee founde either to haue slipped out of course, or to haue beene changed by the in∣jurie of time, or by corrupt custome and vse.








XXI.


ANd for that the rights of Commerce which doe ensue by Peace ought not to be made vnfruitfull, as they would be if the Subiects of the most renowned King of 
England, Scotland &c.
 whilest they haue re∣course to and from the Kingdomes and Do∣minions of the said King of 
Spaine
 and Arch∣dukes, and do remaine there for Commerce, should bee molested in the cause of Consci∣ence: therefore to the intent their Traffique may be safe, and without danger, as well on Land as on Sea, the said renowned King of 
Spaine,
