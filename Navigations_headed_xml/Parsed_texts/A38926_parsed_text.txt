TO THE READER.


'TIS well known, that Ireland was conquer'd at first by the 
English,
 and bad been all along un∣der the easie Yoke of the Kings of 
England,
 till 
James
 II. ascended the Throne. But he, by a Policy, contrary to all the World, designing to subdue 
Eng∣land
 to Popery and 
French
 Government, endeavour'd all he could to have made 
Ireland
 in her Turn the Instrument of that preposterous Conquest. To which purpose, he made use of the general Inclination of that People to the Romish Religion, sent for whole Regiments of that Nation into 
England,
 bred 'em up both for. Officers and Souldiers, with no less Care than the Turks do their 
Janizaries;
 and when he had fill'd all {iIre∣land} with expert Warriors, deliver'd up the whole Power of the Government into the hands of the 
Roman
 Catholicks; so that all that part of the 
English
 Monarchy was only tackt to 
England,
 by the single Thread of Papistical Obedience, during a Catholick Reign. After which, King 
James
 himself, ha∣ving abdicated 
England,
 headed a general Revolt of the 
Irish
 from the Imperial Crown of 
Great Britain,
 which had only left subordinate to it the City of 
London-Derry,
 and one Corner of 
Ulster.
 So that so fair a Portion of the 
British
 Dominion, so Convenient for spacious 
Harbors,
 so fertile for the Soil, so abounding in all Things for the support of humane Life, and so particularly famous for admitting no venomous Crea∣tures to live in it, but only Priests and Jesuits, was either to be quite lost, or quite to be re
conquer'd.




Therefore while the late King 
James,
 assisted with 
French
 Succours, commanded all things, and had set the forfeited Crown of 
Irleand
 upon his 
Head,
 Duke 
Schomberg
 was by King 
William
 sent to stop the Career of the abdicated Prince, and his abominated Crew of 
Gallick
 Foreigners. And first of all the Duke, like the Roman 
Fabius, Cunctando resti∣tuit rem.
 Next King 
William
 in Person, like the far-fam'd 
Scipio,
 forc'd the defeated Invader to abandon the King∣dom. And now, lastly, this Campaign, and second 
Summer
 from the Contest begun, you see the threatning War concluded, while the renowned 
Ginckle,
 like a Torrent, sweeps all before him, and after his having broken the Enemy in Battle, stript 'em of all their strong 
Holds
 by storm, or constrain'd 'em to surrender, and scatter'd the Fugitives to starve among the Moun∣tains, leaves no part of the whole Kingdom unreduced under the Obedience of her lawful Sovereigns. Atchievments not at∣tain'd by Number, but by Courage and Conduct, and meriting large 
Encomiums,
 beyond the narrow Limits of a Preface.


And now I would fain know what are become of those brisk 
Jacobites,
 who thought a languishing 
French
 Cause could be supported by laying malicious and extravagant Wagers. Where-e'er they are, they have nothing now to do, but to pay their lost Money, and, with 
Hudibrass,
 conclude, That Wa∣gers are Fools Arguments. And indeed, 'tis pity, they do not live at this time in 
France,
 where the King is setting so many Projects on foot to raise Money. For their Names would cer∣tainly be taken, to inform the King where the Men of Money liv'd. And then he presently sends his Officers for such a 
Sum
 to be re-paid 
ad Graecas Kalendas.
 I only tell'ent the 
Story;
 let them pick out the 
Inference
 themselves.












AN EXACT JOURNAL OF THE Victorious Progress of Their 
Majesties Forces
 this 
Summer
 in 
Ireland,
 &c.


HIS Majesty, King 
WILLIAM
 III. by the pro∣sperous Success of his Arms at the 
Boyn
 the last Year, was in a very short time become Master of the greatest patt of 
Ireland;
 and had driven the late King 
James
 quite out of the Kingdom; but the Season of the Year, and the excessive Rains, so frequent in that Country, would not permit him any farther Action. For which reason, after he had given order for his Forces to take up their Winter-Quarters in such a Manner, as to shut up the Rebels within the most narrow limits that might be, and prevent their Incursions into the regain'd Countries, His Majesty returned for 
England;
 leaving to Com∣mand the Army and compleat his Conquests, General 
Ginkle,
 a Person of great Experience, Fidelity, Conduct and Expedi∣tion; as will appear by the ensuing Journal. So that if Story receive its lustre from the Grandeur of the Actions which it re∣lates, perhaps this Journal may be thought as considerable as has for many years come forth; as well for the Courage of the Souldiers, the Difficulty and Success of their Euterprizes, and the Importance of their Conquests.

During the 
Winter,
 Both sides lay quiet, but the very Ap∣proach of Spring warm'd the 
English
 to Action, which tho' not so considerable, yet was preparatory to facilitate the Opening of the grand Campaign, which did not begin till sometime after. For upon the 
14th.
 of 
March
 (where this Journal begins) Colo∣nel 
Lillington,
 between eight and nine at Night, march'd from 
Roscreagh,
 with a Party of his own, which being joyn'd by ano∣ther from 
Bix,
 made up together Three Hundred Horse, Foot and Dragoons, and advanc'd toward 
Nagah;
 but finding the way to be longer then he expected, and day coming on, he de∣tach'd Eighteen Horse and as many Foot, which he mounted upon 
Garrans,
 and made all the haste he could to secure the Bridge about half a Mile from 
Nenagh.
 Upon which the whole Garrison sallied out, to oppose him: However with that small party he maintain'd the Pass, till his Foot came up; and then leaving them at the Bridge, he advanc'd with his Horse toward the Enemy, who at a distance were very free of their Shot, but so soon as the 
English
 came nere them, began to run: upon which the 
English
 pursu'd them, and kill'd about Twenty, of which number was a Lieutenant, and took one Cornet. This done, the Colonel sent a Detachment to secure the Pass on the other side of 
Nenagh,
 towards 
Limerick,
 while the rest of his Men entered the Town (the Rebels flying into the Castle) and burnt all the Houses, together with a great Quantity of Malt and Mcal, and brought away three hundred Head of black Cat∣tel, with the Loss but of two Men slain out-right, and another wounded; but of the Rebels were kill'd between forty and fifty.


At the same time News came from 
Cork,
 that upon advice that a Party of the Rebels were come before 
Ballimagoolis,
 a fron∣tier Garrison possess'd by the 
English
 in that County, a Party was sent from 
Cork
 to relieve it, of which the Enemy being inform'd, they drew off in great disorder; whereupon the Garrison sallied out, kill['d several of the Enemy, and took sever Prisoners.


Upon the 15th of 
March
 a detach'd Party or 150 Dragoons, 100 Militia-Horse, and 130 Foot, marched from 
Cork
 under the Command of Major 
Culliford,
 toward 
Ballyclongh,
 where the Rebels were about to have entrench'd themselves; but upon the appearing of the 
English,
 they quitted their Works, and fled with that haste, that all the 
English
 could do in the pursuit was,

to take seven Prisoners, of which four were Officers. With better success a Party of Sir 
David Collier
's Regiment, quartered about 
Bandon,
 together with some of the 
Militia
 of that Place, 300 in all, Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel 
George Hamilton,
 mar∣ched at the same time into the Enemies Quarters about 
Bantry,
 where they killed above seventy of the Rebels, took fifteen Priso∣ners, six hundred Head of Black Cattel, and a good number of Horses, without the loss of one Man.


Of this Action, soon after there came a more full account: That upon notice that Brigadier 
Caroll
 had a design to send five Companies of Foot, with some Ammunition, to joyn Collonel 
O Donavan,
 in order to maintain 
Bantry,
 and put the Country under Contribution; Lieut. Coll. 
Hamilton
 marched on the 15th of 
March,
 with 200 Foot of Sir 
David Colliers
 Regiment, 60 Horse commanded by Lieut. Coll. 
Ogilby,
 and 80 of the Militia, and the next day about two in the Afternoon, came in sight of 
Bantry;
 but finding that the Enemy had quitted the Place the same Morning, followed them with all the expedition he could. Whereupon the Enemy, perceiving themselves so closely pur∣sued, left all their Cattel behind, and betook themselves into the Bogs; however the 
English
 followed 'em four Miles, kill'd about 40, took 14 Prisoners, Coll. 
Courcy
 narrowly escaping, and brought off 1500 Head of Black Cattel, leaving several thousands be∣hind, for want of People to drive 'em, That night the 
English
 stay'd at 
Bantry;
 and the next day, after they had burnt the Town, returned back. In their way, the Enemy had laid 600 Men in Ambush, about six Miles from 
Bantry;
 but being disco∣vered by the Vantcurriers of the Party, after one Volly they ran away to their Hills and Bogs, whither the 
English
 could not pur∣suc them


March
 25. Thirty of the Militia-Dragoons, commanded by Lieutenant 
Powel,
 were ordered to fetch up several Persons out of the County of 
Meath,
 who were suspected to have been concer∣ned in the Murther of Coll. 
Foulks
's Souldiers; but in his re∣turn, he had notice that a Party of Rapparees way-laid him not far from 
Hackets
-Town, with a Resolution to rescue the Prisoners: Upon which, he sent away seventeen of his Dragoons with the Prisoners, and with the other thirteen marched to 
Hackets
-Town; where sending for the Constable, after some hard threat∣ning

Words, the Constable inform'd him where the Rapparees lay; and then he immediately march'd to find 'em out. So soon as he approached the Place, he advanced with four of his Men into a Field adjoyning, where he fell in with a Party of twenty eight 
Irish,
 commanded by Captain 
O Neale.
 The Enemy seeing so small a number, came up and fired at 'em, but without doing any hurt to the 
English,
 who answer'd them in the same Element to better purpose, killing two of the Rebels, and wounding 
O Neale
 himself. By which time, the rest of the 
English,
 being come in, charged the 
Irish,
 and kill'd four of them, put the rest to flight, and pursued them from place to place, till they had killed about twenty of them, and among the rest their Captain 
O Neale;
 who be∣ing wounded before, was now perfectly cured; his Enemies becom∣ing his Surgeons. Of the 
English
 only three were wounded, and two Horses kill'd.


March
 27. Captain 
Mark Baggot,
 who came as a Spy from 
Limerick,
 and was taken in Womens Apparel, was try'd, and sen∣tenc'd by a Court-Martial; but his Execution was respited, upon his offering to make some discovery. However, it appear∣ing afterwards that he did but dally with Justice, and that all his pretended Discoveries were of no moment, he was hang'd out∣right upon the Twentieth of 
May
 following. At the conclusion of this Month, a Proclamation was published in 
Dublin,
 bearing Date 
March
 26. purporting,


That notwithstanding the great Clemency extended by their Majesties to the Popish, 
Irish,
 whereby upon their submission they have had equal protection with their Protestant Subjects, yet such was the inveterate Malice of many, that upon all occa∣sions they not only relieved their Majesties Enemies, but joyn∣ed with them in committing and concealing many horrid Mur∣thers, one of which of eight Souldiers inhumanly strangled at one time, and in one place, was lately discovered, to have been per∣petrated by the Inhabitants of the Place where the Souldiers were quartered, for which some of the Criminals had receiv'd just Punishment: And the Lords Justices-being fully satisfied that such Offences could not be committed without the help or con∣nivance of the Protected Inhabitants; and having received In∣formation that there was a Confederacy among them to relieve their Majesties Enemies, and to take all Opportunities to destroy

their Officers and Souldiers; their Lordships therefore declar'd, That if any such Murthers be hereafter committed, and the Inhabitants do not use their utmost endeavours to apprehend the Malefactors, that they shall be put out of their Majesties protection, and be proceeded against as Spies and Enemies, accor∣ding to the course of War.


April
 2. Coll. 
Tiffin
 sent out from 
Ballyshannon
 a Party of two hundred Foot, and two Troops of Coll. 
Winns
 Dragoons, who marched within three Miles of 
Slego,
 where they kill'd thirty two of Captain 
Macksherry
's Men, and took nine, and brought away with them a Booty of 180 Cows, 50 Sheep, and 30 Horses; but the Captain with the rest made their Escapes to the Moun∣tains.


April
 4. A Party of 
Longford
 Garison, meeting with some of the Enemies Dragoons neear the River 
Enye,
 slew six; upon which, the rest taking the River where it was not fordable, ten more of them were drown'd: Such a strange thing is Fear, that it makes many Men run from one Death to another.


April
 5. A small Party of Dragoons, commanded by Quar∣ter-Master 
Topham,
 met with a detach'd Party of the Rebels, under the Command of Captain 
Bourke;
 of which they slew five, and an Ensign, the rest betaking themselves to their heels.


The same day Brigadier 
Stewart
 sent from 
Belturbat
 a Detach∣ment of fifty Foot and twenty Dragoons, under the Command of Captain 
Stewart,
 with Orders to march toward 
Mohil,
 to free the Country from the 
Rapparees.
 The next morning, by break of day, being come within a Mile of the Place, they discover'd two Troops of the Enemies Dragoons, and about fifty Foot, that were guarding some 
Kereights;
 upon which, the 
English
 see to work with them, without any Preambles; but the Rebels, after the first firing, quitted their Horses, and betook themselves to the Woods and Bogs, whither the 
English
 Foot pursuing them, made a shift to kill thirty, and take five Prisoners: Which done, the Victors return'd to their Quarters, without any manner of Loss, bringing along with them about an hundred Head of Black Cattel, and between sixty and seventy Horses.


April
 6. Quarter-Master 
Topham,
 with eighteen Dragoons and twelve Foot-Souldiers mounted upon 
Garrans,
 surpriz'd the Ene∣mies Guards near 
Newsastle,
 killed seventeen, and brought away

nine Prisoners, seven of which being found to be 
Rapparees,
 were immediately hang'd.


April
 7. Fifteen hundred of the 
Irish
 Army came before 
Inish∣keam,
 and attackt the Garrison of that Place, consisting of no more than forty four Men, commanded by Ensign 
Lindsay
 and Ensign 
Dalyel;
 but notwithstanding so great a multitude of the Rebels, a part of that small Garrison defended the two Avenues to the Town above two Hours, till some of the Popish Inhabi∣tants treacherously gave the Enemy entrance into the Town through a by-way, and then the 
English
 retreated to the main Guard, which they maintain'd six Hours longer, at what time the Rebels summoned the Defendants to surrender; and upon their refusal, had brought together several Hundreds of Faggots to fire the Guard-House; when in the very nick of Opportnnity, Collonel 
Ogilby,
 with a Party of Horse and Foot, came to their Relief; upon whose approach, the Enemy drew off in confusion; which the Garrison perceiving, sallied out upon the Rebels, and kill'd about fifty, with no more than the loss of one Man.


April
 9. Some of Captain 
Green
's Militia-Dragoons, marching into the Enemies Quarters, kill'd several of the 
Rapparees,
 and laid in Ashes a Village that gave them harbor. The same day also a Court-Martial was held, where Brigadier 
Stewart
 presided, and where several Persons, who upon their Tryals appear'd to be Spies, and such as had assisted and sheltered the 
Rapparees,
 were sentenced to be hanged.


April
 13. Quarter-Master 
Callaghan
 went out with a Party, and in a short time after, return'd with eleven Prisoners, twelve Horses, and seventy Head of Black Cattel.


April
 18. General 
Ginkle
 arrived at 
Dublin,
 whither most of the General Officers repaired at the same time, to consult with the Lords Justices about the Affairs of the Campaign, and hast∣ning their Majesties Forces to take the Field; which he was the more encourag'd to do, in regard that the 
Monmouth
 Yacht had already brought Money for the Army, and that several other Ships were arrived at 
Cork, Waterford,
 and 
Kingsale,
 with Re∣cruits both of Horse and Foot, of which two thousand were by that time come to 
Dublin,
 where, through the great Care and Diligence of the General, the Train of Artillery, with the Wag∣gons and Carriages lay all ready fitted.




Much about the same time was published a Proclamation for the apprehending and securing 
Christopher Brown
 a Romish Priest, who by the Examinations of several Persons, appeared to be, if no the first Contriver, and principal Directer, yet a main Abetter and Incourager of the Murther of many of their Ma∣jesties Souldiers, in 
Mallahudder
's Church; and proposing a Reward of Fifty Pounds for any Person that should seize him.


April
 19. No less than seven hundred of the 
Irish
 standing-Army attackt a Stone-House, called 
Croghan,
 near 
Philipstown,
 and valiantly took a Corporal and six common Souldiers, after they had with much more Bravery defended themselves till all their Powder was spent, and that they had killed twelve of the Enemy.


But this Loss was reveng'd the same day with advantage; for the 
English
 being inform'd, that a considerable number of the Rebels were come near to 
Macromp,
 one of their Majesties Fron∣tier Garrisons, a Party of eighty Horse and an nundred and fifty Dragoons, of the Army, and as many of the Militia, was drawn out under the Command of Major 
Kirk.
 This Party marched the 19th in the Evening, and by break of day the next Morning came up with the Rebels, who presently took to their Sanctua∣ries in the Woods and Bogs, whither the 
English
 pursu'd them; and after a chace of some hours kill'd twenty, took five Prisoners, and brought off some Horses and Cattel. Much about the same time the 
Rapparees
 coming with a strong Party to 
Curraglass
 near 
Tallough,
 had stollen some Horses belonging to Collonel 
Denopp
's Regiment, and surpriz'd four Troops. Upon which, the Collo∣nel gave present Orders for the taking up several of the 
Irish.
 In∣habitants about that place; declaring withal, That if they did not procure the Horses and Men to be brought back by such a certain day, they should every one be hang'd: Which wrought so effectually upon the Prisoners, that both Men and Horses were brought back, by the time appointed, to the place where they were taken; and for a further Attonement of the Injury done, some of the Fellows also, that had been Actors in the Rob∣bery.




At the same time three hundred 
Rapparees,
 lying in Ambu
 cade, not far from 
Kennegad,
 had seiz'd upon forty eight Sack of Meal, that were going thither with a very small Guard that made their escapes; of which notice being given to the Town, a Party of the Garrison fally'd out, recover'd a good part of the Meal, and kill'd several of the 
Rapparees,
 with their Cap∣tain.


April
 24. Captain 
Pallaser,
 upon some intelligence that was given him of the 
Rapparees,
 march'd out with forty Fire-locks of the Army, and twenty of the Militia; but by the Treachery of one 
Terence Magragh,
 was drawn into an Ambush of no less than two of the Enemies Regiments of Foot and some Horse: Never∣theless, the 
English
 got into the Ruins of an old Castle, where theless, the 
English
 got into the Ruins of an old Castle, where they vigoriously defended themselves till all their Ammunition was spent; but then were forc'd to accept of Quarter, and were carried Prisoners to 
Nanagh.


April
 27. The Earl of 
Meath
's, and the Lord 
Lisburn
's Regi∣ments arrived at 
Mullingar,
 and encamp'd without the Town. The same day one 
Walter Brown,
 formerly High Constable of the Barony of 
Delwyn,
 was hang'd for a Spy in the same Town. And upon the same 27th of 
April
 also it was, that five hundred of the Militia of the County of 
Dublin,
 marched out of that City to the Town of 
Kildare,
 where they joyn'd the Regiment of Horse, commanded by Collonel 
Piper,
 and which were design'd to clear those parts from the Robberies and Violences of the 
Rapparees.
 And the same day arriv'd in 
Dublin
 Road the Ships from 
Eng∣land,
 laden with the Stores for the Artillery and Ordnance.


April
 28. Collonel 
Brewer,
 and Lieutenant-Collonel 
Hamilton,
 with six hundred Foot and twenty Horse, marched into the Enemies Quarters beyond the Castle of 
Donere,
 between which place and 
Kilbegan,
 about two thousand of the 
Rapparces
 had for some time shelter'd themselves in Hutts and Cabins. But though at the first sight of the 
English
 they drew up in a kind of Bravado, upon the Hills, in several Bodies of Horse and Foot, yet upon the Collonels nearer approach, they flew to their Bogs and Woods, whither the 
English
 pursu'd them, kill'd about fifty, and after they had burnt a great number of their Hutts and Hovels, returned to their Quarters.




April
 30. Capt. 
Clayton
 was sent with a Party of Men, to relieve the Garrison of 
Ballimagooly,
 where Capt. 
Hornycrose
 then comman∣ded, and was the same day to have march'd his Men to 
Cork,
 so soon as Captain 
Clayton
 had relieved him. But understanding that the Garrison of 
Ballyclough
 had a design to intercept him, he thought it not convenient to march by day, and therefore set forward about 12 a Clock at Night. However, this was not so privately carried, but that the 
Irish
 had notice of it, and thereupon drew out a hun∣dred and twenty of their best Horse, and as many Dragoons, with two hundred and fifty Voluntiers and 
Rapparees,
 commanded by Brigadier 
Caroll,
 Sir 
James Cotter,
 the Lord of 
Kinsale,
 Collo∣nel 
Lasly,
 Major 
Slingsby,
 Captain 
Coppinger
 and Captain 
Comb∣don,
 who fell upon the 
English
 just on the other side of 
Six-mile∣water,
 about three of the Clock in the Morning. Upon their ap∣proach, the 
English
 faced, and about twenty fired upon the Ene∣my so well to the purpose, that they brake the Rebels Front, and put them into some disorder; which gave the 
English
 a good opportunity to retreat to an old Pound that had a Mud-wall about it, breast-high, and to clap up a Truckle at the place where they entred. Whereupon the advanced Party of the Enemy, belie∣ving the day their own, boldly made up to the Pound, and of∣fered the Captain and his Man Quarter; which he refusing, they began a brisk Charge, and pressed hard upon the 
English,
 by whom the Rebels were so warmly received, that several of their Number were slain, and carried off, during the heat of the Acti∣on: However, they made a second and a third Attack, though with the same ill success. And thus the Conflict lasted for seve∣ral hours, till notice of it being carried to 
Cork,
 a Party was forthwith sent from thence to the Captain's relief; but the Ene∣my were all fled before they arrived, leaving dead upon the place Captain 
Coppinger
 and Caprain 
Combdon:
 Collonel 
Lasly
 and the Lord of 
Kinsale
 were likewise dangerously wounded, and carried off, and about fifty more wounded. Major 
Slingsby
 was brought dangerously wounded to 
Cork,
 where, in little hopes of Life, he was so ingenious as to confess, That he believed the Hand of 
God
 was against their Party, for that altlio' they offered and promised Quarter to the 
English,
 yet had they yielded, they had resolved to put them all to the Sword. Of the 
English
 were lost no more than eight Men out of fourscore; but of the Enemy 'tis be∣lieved that more were kill'd and wounded than those they fought against.




At the beginning of 
May,
 the Lords Justices put forth a Pro∣clamation, strictly charging and commanding all Officers, Civil and Military, and all Souldiers of their Majesties Army, not to molest any Sutlers that should have a Warrant from the Lord Justices, the General of the Army, or Collonel of any Regi∣ment, to follow the Camp; nor to take any thing from the said Sutlers, nor to use any violence towards them, upon pain of be∣ing severely proceeded against: And that the Collonels should take care that the Souldiers paid for every thing they had of the Sutlers, according to the setled Rates: And to prevent the Rob∣beries and Spoils committed upon the Country, by several unne∣cessary Persons that followed the Camp, they further ordered all their Majesties Subjects, both Protestants and Papists, to stay at, or repair to, their several Habitations, for the Preservation and Improvement of the same; and that no Persons should pre∣sume to follow the Camp, but such as brought Provisions to the Army, or upon some lawful occasion approved by the General, or Commander in Chief.


By another Proclamation, all the Inhabitants of the Counties of 
Waterford
 and 
Tipperary,
 were commanded to repair to their Places of Habitation, or the next Garrison; and the Inhabitants of the Counties of 
Cork, Limerick,
 and 
Kerry,
 were ordered to do the same, in order to their being employed in the Militia, for the Defence of the Country, when their Army should be drawn into the Field.


And by an Order of General 
Ginkle,
 all Officers and Souldiers, and all other Persons whatsoever, were strictly commanded not to press any Horses or Carts, without license from himself in writing; nor to press any Horse that was actually listed in the Militia, upon any pretence whatever.


May
 1. Captain 
Thomas White
 of the old Lord 
George Hamil∣ton
's Regiment, drew out an hundred Men under the Command of Captain 
Johnston,
 who marched with his Party to 
Belnamona
 in 
Kings County,
 where he had such good success, that by break of day he surprized two Troops of Dragoons of Brigadier 
Clif∣ford
's Regiment, and three Troops of Horse of the Lord 
Merrion
's Regiment, kill'd Lieutenant 
Archibald,
 Quarter-Master 
Barnell,
 and fifteen Dragoons, took two Ensigns, and other Pri∣soners, burnt the Town, and returned with a good Booty of Horses, Arms and Cattel.


My
 3. The Governour of 
Clonmel,
 with a Detachment of

Horse, and two Troops of the Militia-Dragoons, marched by Night into the Enemies Quarters toward 
Michels-Town;
 but not meeting with any of the Rebels, was returning back to his Quar∣ters, when a Corporal of Horse making a halt a little behind, was shot at by four 
Rapparees:
 Upon which, the 
English
 surroun∣ded the Wood; and after some hours Man-Hunting, killed above thirty of the 
Rapparees,
 and one 
Cashan
 their Captain.


May
 4. Major 
Wood
 marched from 
Mountmilock
 to 
Castle-Cuff,
 with a Party of three hundred Foot, drawn out of Collo∣nel 
Lloyd
's and the Lord 
George Hamilton
's Regiment, and fifty Horse of Collonel 
Byerly
's. In his march, he divided the Foot in∣to several small Parties, in order to surprize the 
Rapparees
 in the woods and Bogs, keeping with the Horse along the skirts of the Bog, to hinder their escape: By which means, they made a shift to kill about seventy 
Rapparees,
 and to take a good num∣ber of their Cattel. Which done, Major 
Wood
 advanc'd with thirty Foot, and thirty four Horse, beyond the 
Togher
 of 
Mal∣lybone,
 and from thence sent the Cattel homeward under a Guard of thirty Men, and was returning to his Party with those few that were with him, about ten of the Clock in the Morning, when he discover'd two Bodies of Men of the late Kings Army, com∣puted to consist of four hundred each Body, marching silently between the Wood and the Mountains; but who, so soon as they perceiv'd themselves to be espy'd, beat their Drums; upon which, the Major drew up the chiefest part of his whole Party in a Plough'd field, and fac'd 'em: Presently the Enemies Granadiers came over the Hedge, and made towards the Major, till seeing the 
English
 stand firm, they also made a halt. Whereupon the Major, apprehending that the thirty Men that guarded the Booty, were not got clear of the Wood, and consequently might be exposed to the Enemies Numbers, wheel'd off by the skirt of the Wood to their succor; and by that time he had got his Horse and Foot over the Bog, he heard the Enemy firing very thick upon the thirty Men, who bravely however oppos'd 'em, under the Command of Lieutenant 
Ellis.
 The noise of this firing brought in fourscore more of the 
English,
 who had been laid to watch the 
Rapparees.
 Thereupon Major 
Wood
 order'd the Foot to march in two Parties on each side the River, while he with the Horse march'd between 'em both. Being in this manner come within sight of the Enemy, and judging that the Horse might do most service, by fetching a compass about, and getting behind

the Rebels, he gallop'd round, with an intention to fall upon their Reer; which the Enemy perceiving, and being at the same time hard put to it by the Foot, began to make an orderly Re∣treat. But then it was, that the Major, unwilling to lose his Ad∣vantage, fell immediately upon-their Flank with his Horse, and that with so much Courage and undaunted Bravery, that he put the Enemy first into great disorder, and soon after to an absolute flight. Both Horse and Foot pursu'd the Fugitives quite through the Wood down to the Bog, and kill'd about 150 among whom was Capt. 
Chales,
 with 2 Lieutenants, and took Prisoners Maj. 
John Fitz-Patrick
 who commanded the whole Force, 5 Captains, 9 Lieute∣nants, 2 Ensigns (belonging to the several Regiments of Coll. 
Butler
 of 
Ballyraggats,
 Collonel 
Robert Grace,
 Collonel 
Charles Moore,
 Sir 
Morice Eustace,
 and Collonel 
Simon Lutterel
's Dragoons) and a hundred and five private Souldiers, six Serjeants, seventeen Cor∣porals, a Surgcon and three Drums; together with a hundred and fifty Muskets: All which was done by a hundred and ten of the 
English
 Foot, and thirty four Horse. With the Foot were Major 
Rider,
 Captain 
Nenny,
 Captain 
Dixy,
 Lieutenant 
Barton,
 and Ensign 
Russel.
 With the Horse were Cornet 
Joshua,
 Cornet 
Haslington,
 Adjutant 
Robinson,
 and Quarter-Master 
Cadford,
 who with their Men, both Horse and Foot, behaved themselves with an extraordinary Bravery; gaining so considerable a Victory over above six times their number, with the loss only of Adju∣tant 
Robinson,
 one Corporal, and two Foot-Souldiers kill'd out∣right, and one Trooper wounded.


The same day this memorable Action was performed; a Party of Collonel 
Brewer
's Men were going from 
Mullingar
 towards 
Kinnagan;
 at what time a Serjeant and four Souldiers lagging a good way behind, were surpriz'd and murther'd by the 
Rap∣parees;
 only one escap'd, whom they left for dead, and whose Eyes they had most barbarously pick'd out with a Skean.


But the next Day, being the 6th of 
May,
 three 
Rapparees
 were taken, who being brought to 
Mullingar,
 one of them, whose Name was 
Ellis,
 gave Evidence against the other two, who were thereupon immediately hanged. The same day Captain 
Richard Poynts
 went out of 
Mullingar,
 with a hundred Men of that Gar∣rison, and falling upon a Party of 
Rapparees
 near 
Managhan,
 kill'd above forty; and Lieut. Coll. 
Hodson
 sallying out at the same time from 
Mountmelock,
 posted his Men over night at a Place call'd 
Isikapog;
 the morning by break of day, the Foot antred the Woods and Bogs, while the Horse scoured the shirts

of both; to the destruction of 18 of the 
Rapparee
 Vermin kill'd out-right, and several taken Prisoners, among whom was one 
O Rourk
 their Captain; who because he was notoricusly known to have committed several Robberies, was hang'd upon the Place. A fair satisfaction, in so short a time, for the Mur∣ther of the four 
Mullingar English,
 and digging out the Eyes of the fifth.


May
 8. The 
French
 Convoy arriv'd at 
Linner
-Lake, with Pro∣vision, Cloaths and Ammunition, but neither Men nor Mony: The Sieur 
de
 St. 
Ruth,
 who is to command the Rebels, and two 
French
 Lieutenant-Generals, came over in the same Ships. And this was lookt upon like the pouring of Brandy down the Throat of a dying Man.


May
 11. A hundred and fifty of the 
Irish
 Army came to 
Castle-Lyons,
 and took away some Cattel from thence: But Coll. 
Donep
 being there with about 20 
Danes,
 and 20 of the Militia-Dragoons, pursu'd the Enemy; at what time a Lieutenant of the 
Danes,
 with 8 Horse and 6 Dragoons, getting before the rest, and overtaking the Rebels at 
Ballyderrawne,
 beat off 60 from the Hedges which they had lin'd in that part, though with the loss of the Licutenant, who was there slain. But then the Collonel coming up with the rest of his Party, constrain'd the Rebels to run; and being reinforc'd with 50 Men out of the Regiments of Col∣lonel. 
Boyle,
 Collonel 
St. Leger,
 and Captain 
Barry
's Militia-Troops that lay posted at 
Formoy,
 they continu'd the pursuit a Mile an half beyond 
Kilworth,
 kill'd about 50, of which two were Commission-Officers, took 40 Horses, and several Silver-hilted Swords, Cloaths, Arms, and other Accoutrements, recover'd the Booty, and got about 30 Cows besides.


May
 14. The Lords Justices and Council set forth a Proclama∣tion, declaring, That all Popish 
Irish
 Inhabirants, where any 
Rap∣parees
 should commit any Robberies, Burnings or Murthers, or make any Insurrections, if they did not immediately give notice of such 
Rapparees
 and Insurrections, to the Justice of Peace or Military Officer next to their Habitations, and assist them in their taking of such 
Rapparees,
 and suppressing such Insurrections, should be deem'd Confederates with the Rebels, and Enemies to their Majesties Government, and be proceeded against with the utmost severity of Military execution. They farther order'd, That no protected 
Irish
 Papists should be out of their Houses after nine at Night, nor stir out of their Houses before four in the Morning,

upon pain of being put out of their Majesties Protection. And that after the 30th of 
May,
 if any Arms or Ammunition should be found in the possession of such 
Irish
 Papists, they should be lookt upon as Rebels, and punish'd accordingly.


May
 26. The Train of Artillery, consisting of 36 Pieces of Cannon, and 8 Mortars, set forward from 
Dublin,
 and upon the 30th arriv'd at the general Rendezvouz near 
Mullingar.
 The same day General 
Ginkle
 went from 
Dublin
 to the Army, ex∣pecting General 
Douglass
 to joyn him with 12000 Men from the North.


They who beheld the vast Preparations for this Campaign, had a fair prospect of their Majesties extream Care and Provi∣dence for the total Recovery of 
Ireland,
 and were easily convinc'd that the Publick Treasure was not now as formerly given for the Welfare, but expended for the Destruction of the Monarchy; parted with for the Honour of the Nation, but wasted upon Plea∣sure, while they beheld all the proper Ports of the Kingdom con∣tinually fill'd with Ships and Vessels, some transporting Money, others Recruits to the Army; while they beheld such amazing Quantities of Provision, Arms and Ammunition; 500 Draught-Horses at a time for the Carriages, and such other vast stores for the Artillery, with all other Necessaries for so great an Enter∣prize. Which shews the difference of a Nation's being under the Care of good Stewards, and from being under the negligent Mis∣government of Profuseness and unthrifty Prodigality.


As for the 
Irish,
 they were as busie at the same time, as their Assistance would permit 'em: And certain information was given, That their new 
French
 General 
St. Ruth,
 issu'd out all his Or∣ders in the 
French
 King's Name, and requir'd several of the Rebel's Officers to take new Commissions under the 
French
 King, in prosecution of a Design of subjecting 
Ireland
 to 
France,
 that had been long carried on in that Kingdom by 
Abbot Gra∣velle,
 and of which his own Letters to a great Person in 
France,
 that have been since intercepted, are a sufficient Evidence.


But before we launch into the grand Campaign, there is this Observation to be made, That though these lesser Encounters which have been hitherto related, may seem to be of little value, yet considering the continu'd success of the 
English,
 though for the most part their Parties were much inferior to the Enemy, and the continu'd bad Fortune of the Rebels, such a Prosperity must needs be a great Encouragement to the one side, and no

small Disheartning to the other, not to have one smile of For∣tune in their Favor. Add to this, the picking up of so many of the Enemy for Hawks-meat, not suddenly taken notice of by a cursory Reading, was like a kind of Hectick Feaver, wasting their Body by degrees; which if the condition of the Kingdom would have endur'd it, must have consum'd the whole Bulk of the 
Irish
 Opposi∣tion at the long run. For most certainly it may be found by an easie computation, that in less than two Months before the Campaign open'd, the Rebels lost, by these petty Gleanings, 1079, Men kill'd out right, and above 230 Prisoners, in all 1309 Men, of which some were considerable Officers, and perhaps in the Number of the most experienc'd and daring Commanders; whereas about 40 was the utmost of the 
English
 loss; besides, that the ill 
Omen
 of being always beaten, makes a deep impression in the Minds of Men more couragious than the 
Irish.


But now all things being in a readiness for the 
English
 to take the Field, General 
Ginkle,
 Commander in Chief of their Ma je∣sties Forces in the Kingdom in 
Ireland,
 upon the 6th of 
May,
 de∣camp'd from 
Mullingar;
 and being joyn'd the same day by Ge∣neral 
Douglass
 with the Northern Forces, which made up the whole Army 15 Battalions of Foot, and 3000 Horse, upon the 7th of 
May
 came before 
Ballymore,
 seated upon a tongue of firm Land, jetting out into a Lake, being in circumference about a Mile, ending on the two sides with Bogs that are unaccessible, which leave but a very streight Avenue from the main Land. The Enemy had fortified this place with two Retrenchments in the Winter, of which the first was a Horn-work, the second two whole Bastions, whose outward Curtains on each side extended down to the Lake; and within the last Retrenchment was an old 
Danish
 Mount, so fortified as that it made a third Retreat.


Upon the General's approach to the Town, the Marquiss 
de Rovigny
 was sent before with a strong Detachment of Horse and Dragoons, to possess himself of a Pass between the Town and 
Athlone;
 and as soon as the advanc'd part of the Army appear'd upon the Hills that look into the Fort, the Enemy began to play upon the 
English
 with two 
ield-Pieces, but without doing any harm. In the mean time a Detachment of Foot was sent to pos∣sess themselves of the Rebels out Posts, which they quitted upon the approach of the 
English,
 and ran as fast as they could into 
Ballymore;
 only a Serjeant and twelve Men continu'd firing out of a round Tower, and kill'd two of the 
English:
 But the

Tower soon after being taken by Assault, the Serjeant was hang'd upon a high Hill, in sight of the Enemy, for firing upon the Be∣siegers after the Communication was cut off from him and the Town. That Night the Besiegers raised five different Batteries; the first of 12 Pounders, the second of six 18 Pounders, to ruin the second Retrenchment; the third of 8 Field-Pieces to break the Pallisadoes; the fourth of four 18 Pounders, and two 12 Pounders, which batter'd the Horn-work; as also a Lodgment on the same side for three Mortar pieces. All which were brought to play the same Night. About eight of the Clock the next Mor∣ning, the General sent a Message to the Governour, 
That if he and the Garrison would surrender within two Hours, he would save their Lives, and receive 'em as Prisoners of War: If not, that they should expect no quarter.
 To which the Governor returning a shuffling fort of an Answer, in hopes to get better Terms, the Bat∣teries play'd on, and about Noon the Breaches of the first and second Retrenchments were so far advanc'd, and the Pallisado's so effectually cut down, that the General resolv'd to storm the Town in five several Places, on the Hornwork, and the two sides of the Bog by help of Faggots, and by that means to divide the Garrison, which consisted of 1000 Men. The Besiegers also had four large Wherries a float upon the Lake, which were brought from 
Dublin
 with a great deal of trouble, into which were put an hundred and fifty Granadiers, that at the time of the general Aslault, were to attack the Besieg'd on that side that lay open to the Lake. All which Preparations, and their own Condition, put them into so great a Consternation, that they hung out several white Flags; and about seven a Clock in the Evening, when they left off firing on both sides, the Governour Collonel 
Mich. Bourk,
 and several Officers came out, and submitted to the General's Mercy.


Upon the 9th of 
May
 the Garrison came forth, consisting of 780 Men, drawn out of the Enemies standing-Army, besides 4 Field-Officers, 16 Captains, 14 Lieutenants, 12 Ensigns and Cor∣nets, 
&c.
 and 259 
Rapparees,
 all well arm'd; who all laying down their Arms, were made Prisoners in the innermost part of the Fort. Besides the Garrison, there were above 600 Women and Children, among whom a Load of Ammunition-Bread was or∣der'd to be distributed. There was found in the Place several Sacks of 
French
 Oat-meal, about ten Barrels of Powder, with Shot proportionable in their Magazine, two Field pieces and about

three hundred Head of Cattel, and five hundred Sheep, which were given to the Souldiers.


The same Night that the Town surrendred, there was a hot Alarum that the Enemy was at hand, with a Body of 25000 Men; which occasion'd the Besiegers to double their Guards, and send out a strong Party of Horse and Foot toward 
Athlone,
 who within two Miles of that place, surpriz'd an advanc'd Guard of the Enemies asleep the main Body consisting of 1000 Men who retreated in safety, in regard the 
english
 had no Orders to ad∣vance any farther.


So soon as the Town was taken, the 
English
 fell to work in re∣pairing the Breaches, making some additions of new Works, and levelling the Batteries; and a Garrison was put into it of 500 Men: The Prisoners, being 51 Officers, and 900 Souldiers, were sent a∣way to 
Mullingar,
 and from thence to 
Dublin.
 After this, the General lay a while encamp'd near 
Ballymore,
 in expectation of the Prince of 
Wirtemberg,
 who upon the 4th of 
June
 decamp'd from 
Thurles,
 with the Forces under his Command, consisting of 12000 Horse and Foot.


June
 5. They came to 
Roscreagh,
 where they rested all the next day.


June
 7. They marched on to 
Bir;
 and upon 
June
 the 10th, continu'd their march, and came to 
Streanes
 Town the 14th, and upon the 18th joyn'd the General, six Miles farther in the way to 
Athlone.


On the 18 of 
June,
 early in the Morning, the Army march'd from 
Ballymore;
 and the Prince of 
Wirtemberg
 having joyn'd the General, they encampt at 
Ballymore
's Pass; from whence a strong Detachment of Horse and Dragoons was fent to 
Ath∣lone.


On the 19th the Army came before the Place, passing through many narrow Lanes, which might have cost a great many Men, had the Enemy as floutly defended 'em, as they might have done; and it seem'd a new sight, to behold none but 
French
 Colours in four parts of an 
Irish
 Garrison.


Upon the 20th of 
June,
 a Battery of ten 18 Pounders was fi∣nish'd, and began to play upon the Bastion near the Water side looking toward 
Lanesborough;
 and the Guns were so well directed, that by three of the Clock in the Afternoon, the whole Face, Flank, and part of the Curtain, was laid in Ruins; and thereupon the General gave Orders for an Assault to be made, which was per∣form'd

in this manner: First march'd 300 detach'd Granadiers, then 50 Pioneers with Bavins, next 200 Fuziliers, and then 2 Re∣giments of Foot, commanded by Brigadier 
Stewart;
 after which follow'd 200 Pioneers with more Bavins, and 20 Men with Felling-Axes, to cut away any Barricado of the Enemies they might meet in their way. All things being thus in a readiness, about six in the Evening the Sign was given, by a discharge of all the Cannon in Battery: Upon which, the 
English
 advanc'd in very good Or∣der to the Assault. The Enemy seem'd resolv'd at first to have maintain'd the Breach; but upon the first sight of the Hand-Granadiers, they fled, retiring in great consusion to 
Connaught
-side, divers also leaping over the 
Shannon
 for haste: So that the 
English
 had nothing to do but to enter; which the whole Party did, and advanc'd to the Bridge; where lying open to the Ene∣mies shot from the other side, several of the 
English
 were kill'd and wounded, till the Enginiers had compleated some Blinds to cover them from the Town. In this Action however, not above 20 of the 
English
 were wounded, and some few slain out-right: In the number of the first was Brigadier 
Stewart,
 who was shot in the right Arm and in the Neck, but not dangerously; but Lieut. Coll. 
Gore,
 that led on the Granadiers, was shot at the Breach; and Lieutenant 
Kirk
 of 
Villiars
's Regiment, was unfortu∣nately kill'd by a Cannon-Ball, as he was viewing the Place from the top of a Hill that was just by.


On the 24th, a private Souldier seeing one of the Enemies Colours floating upon the River near the Bridge, threw himself into the Water; and though many shot were made at him, brought it off, and presented it to the General, who gave him a good Reward.


And thus one part of the Town being taken, upon the 25th of 
June,
 the Batteries against the other part of it were all finish'd, and thirty two Pieces of Cannon, and six Mortars, planted upon 'em, which play'd upon the Castle and the Enemies Works, on the other side of the River, with great success.


The 27th at Night the Souldiers wrought hard to repair the Stone-Bridge, of which two Arches were broken down by the Ene∣my: One of them was quite made up, and the other almost fini∣shed, when early next Morning the Enemy pull'd away some of the Planks, and threw them into the River; which made the 
English
 resolve to carry on a close Gallery upon the Bridge; which being done accordingly, Orders were given for storming

the Place on the 29th, at seven in the Morning; but before all things were in a readiness for it, a small Party of the Enemy came out, and set fire to the Gallery, though with the loss of most of their Lives. This Accident occasion'd the deferring the Assault till the next day. In the mean time the Cannon and Bombs continually play'd upon the Town and Castle, doing most terrible execution. However, the success the Enemy had in burning the Gallery, gave them so great assurance, that they did not expect to be so soon attackt.


Nevertheless, all things being in a readiness, in pursuance of the Orders given by General 
Ginkle,
 upon 
Tuesday
 the 30th of 
June,
 about four a Clock in the Afternoon, the Attack was made by 1500 Granadiers, and 6 Battalions of Foot standing ready to sup∣port 'em, if occasion should be. The Signal was the ringing of the 
Church bell,
 upon which the Granadiers (with whom M.G. 
Talmash,
 tho' he did not Command that day, went along as a Voluntier) entred the Ford, which was the only Passage the Assailants had, in regard the Bridge was so broken, that they could not get over it. The Enemy at first fired very smartly, but the Assailants, who waded up to their Breasts in Water with continual 
Huzzaing,
 ad∣vanc'd under the shelter of their own Cannon; and throwing their Granadoes, forc'd the Enemy from their Posts and Tren∣ches; and in less than half an hours time, made themselves en∣tirely Masters of the Town, with all their Enemies Works and the Ruins of the Castle. Major-General 
Maxwel,
 with several other Officers, and 200 common Souldiers, were taken Priso∣ners; and between 1000 and 1200 were kill'd upon the Place, besides Officers of note, such as were Brigadier 
Mackelicuddy,
 Collonels 
Mac-Mahoon, O Neale, O Gara,
 Lieut Collonels 
Mac∣genis
 and 
Barnwel;
 and Maj. 
Murray,
 Coll. 
Grace,
 being slain the day before: The rest escap'd over the Ramparts, and fled to the Enemies Camp; from whence some Battalions were coming to their Relief; but meeting with the Fugitives, and receiving a warm Salute from those very Works that were so very lately their own, they retreated back to their Camp.


Of the 
English
 were about 20 slain, and 30 wounded; while all, both Officers and Souldiers, behav'd themselves beyond an ordi∣nary Imagination, and perhaps beyond the Parallel of many Histo∣ries, where so much Bravery of Enterprize is rarely to be found, for only 3000 Men to assail a fortified Town, cross a River, and make themselves Masters of it in so short a time, in the very

face and view of the Enemy; an Action, with which only the Taking of 
Buda
 can stand in competition: Particularly the Ma∣jor-Generals 
Teteau
 and 
Mackay,
 Brigadier 
de la Meloniere,
 and the Prince of 
Hesse-Dermstadt,
 who conducted the Attack; the Prince of 
Wirtemberg,
 Major-General 
Talmash,
 Count 
Nassau,
 and Brigadier 
Bellasis,
 merited lasting Honour, in contributing so greatly as they did, by their Conduct and Courage, to the good success of so signal an Atchievment. There were in the Town six Pieces of Brass Cannon, and two Mortars; but the stores of Powder, Bullet and Provisions, were but small. The Town and Castle were reduc'd to a heap of Ruins; and the Pri∣soners said, That before the Attack, there were kill'd in the Town about 1200 Men, by the Besiegers Cannon and Bombs, of which, nor of their Bullets or Stones, the Assailants were no Niggards, as having bestow'd upon the Place, before it was taken, 10000 Bullets, 600 Bombs, and several Tun of Stones.


The Town being thus reduc'd, the Enemy decamp'd in the Night-time, between the 30th of 
June,
 and 1st of 
July,
 and re∣treated ten Miles off, to a Place call'd 
Bally-Nash,
 where they lay with the River 
Soke
 before 'em, giving out that they design'd to stand a Battel: In pursuance of which Resolution, they at the same time quitted 
Slego, James
-Town, and 
Lanesborough,
 in so much haste, that they left their Powder and great Guns behind 'em.


On the 10th of 
July
 General 
Ginkle
 pass'd the 
Shannon
 at 
Ath∣lone;
 the Foot over a Bridge of Boats below the Town, the Horse and Artillery over the Stone-Bridge; and that Night they encamp'd about five Miles from 
Athlone.


The 11th they march'd, and encampt on the left side of 
Ballinaslow,
 upon the River 
Suc,
 with in three Miles of the Enemy, who lay very advantagiously encampt at 
Aghriam,
 their left Wing stretching out toward 
Kilkon
el
 Abby, and their right upon 
Rilcommodon
-Hills: Before them lay two Bogs, between which, the Road leads to 
Galloway.
 On their left lay the Ruins of an old Castle, which was entrench'd and lin'd with Foot; and on their right they had made several Entrenchments for the security of their Camp.


On the 14th, in the Morning, the Army march'd from 
Bal∣linaslow,
 and by eleven a Clock had pass'd the River 
Suc,
 the Horse at two Fords, and the Foot over the Stone-Bridge: Where after some skirmishing, the 
English
 drove in the Enemies out-Guards,

and the left Wing of their Majesties Army drew beyond the Bog, which cover'd the Enemies right Wing, and made room for the Foot to advance between that and them. In the mean time, the 
English
 Cannon had dislodg'd the Rebels Horse, from the end of the narrow Lane that leads to 
Aghriam,
 and the Kings Horse and Foot took up their Post there, still pouring over Men into a small spot of firm Land, that lay between the two Bogs and the old Castle.


In the mean time, the Enemy drew down great Bodies of Horse and Foot upon the left Wing of the 
English,
 and were so strongly posted behind the high Banks that lay one behind a∣nother, that the Foot had a very warm dispute with the Rebels for two hours, but at last forc'd 'em to give ground, notwithstan∣ding new Supplies both of Horse and Foot were still sent by the Rebels to relieve and second those that gave way. At the same time also three Battalions of 
English
 Foot advanc'd on the right hand, over the skirt of the Bog, and a little River that supplies the 
Suc,
 into a Corn-Field, where they were warmly entertain'd by several of the Enemies Battalions and Squadrons. However, the 
English
 maintain'd their ground till more Regiments came to their assistance; and forcing the-Enemy to retreat, gave time for the right Wing of Horse to come on, who immediately charg'd up the Hills upon the Squadrons of the Enemy; at what time the left Wing of the 
English
 having beaten the 
Irish
 from their ground, and the Right pressing hard upon 'em at the same time, put 'em into an absolute Rout.


The Victors pursu'd the flying Rebels about four Miles; for Night would not permit 'em to do it any farther, in regard it was six a Clock in the Afternoon before both Armies engag'd, and eight in the Evening before the Enemy was absolutely routed.


The 
Irish
 were never known to fight with more Resolution, especially the Foot; besides, that the Rebels were much superior to the 
English
 in number, being no less than 20000 Foot, and 8000 Horse and Dragoons, with all the Advantage moreover imaginable, that the Situation of the Ground could afford 'em However, the superiour Valour and Conduct of the 
English
 was such, as surmounted all those Disadvantages, and wrested a com∣pleat Victory out of the hands of an Enemy more stubborn than had been known for some Ages in that Kingdom. But it was the last Effort, 
pro Aris & Focis,
 wherein the gasping Honour of the

Choice of all the Catholick Nobility and Gentry of the King∣dom strugled to do its utmost.


Of the Enemy 5000, or if you will believe Major-General 
Do∣rington,
 who was one of the Prisoners, 8000 were slain upon the Place; among whom was the 
French
 General 
St. Ruth,
 who was slain by a Cannon Bullet; the Lord 
Galloway,
 Coll. 
Barker,
 Coll. 
Moore,
 and Coll. 
Baggot,
 with several others.


The Prisoners of note were Maj. Gen. 
Hamilton,
 Brigadier

 Lord

 Major 
Ter. Kelly,
 18 Captains 20 Lieutenants, 4 Cornets, 4 Quarter Masters, 13 Ensigns, 1 Adjutant, and 217 private Soul∣diers: In all 407, which were afterwards made up full 500.


Trophies of Honour were also taken, 12 Standards, 30 Colours, and one Kettle-Drum; with which the Lord 
O Bryan
 was sent into 
England,
 to present 'em to the Queen.


Add to this, That never better Conduct nor Gallantry was ever shewn, than among the General Officers; never more Bravery and Resolution seen among private Souldiers, who, with a sur∣prizing Courage and undaunted Fury, prest on, beat down all before 'em, and forc'd the Enemy from their advantagious Posts and Entrenchments, to make way for Victory and a glorious Triumph, with the loss of no more than 500 slain, and 700 wounded. Of the number of the slain were Maj. Gen. 
Holtstaple,
 Coll. 
Charles Herbert,
 first taken Prisoner at the beginning of the Fight, and afterwards inhumanly murther'd by the Rebels when they saw the Battel lost; Coll.

 the Lord 
Cutts,
 Coll. 
Earle,
 Lieut. Coll. 
Brudenell,
 with some others.


After the Battel was over, the General encampt where the 
wish
 lay, and the next day, being the 13th of 
June,
 sent away

Brigadier 
Eppinger
 with a Detachment of 1200 Horse Horse and Dragoons, to seize 
Portumney,
 where the Rebels had a great Ma∣gazine of Provisions, who soon possess'd himself of it; and the next day, being the 14th, the Fort and Castie of 
Banaker
 surren∣dred to Major 
Wood;
 whereby the 
English
 became Masters of all the Passes upon the 
Shannon,
 except 
Limerick,
 and those within eight Miles of it.


Upon the 17th of 
July
 the Army advanc'd to 
Loghreah,
 and from thence upon the 19th to 
Athenree,
 where the General left about 3000 Horse, under the Command of Lieutenant-General 
Scravenmore,
 and Major-General 
Rovigny,
 to observe the Ene∣mies motion, but more especially to secure the free Passage of the Convoys and great Guns; and from thence advanc'd to 
Gal∣loway.


So soon as the General came before the Place, he sent a Trumpet to the Lord 
Dillon,
 Governour of the Town, and of∣fer'd him the Benefit of the Lords Justices Proclamation of the 7th of 
July,
 in case he surrondred before the Cannon were brought to fire upon the Garrison. His Answer was, 
That Mon∣sieur
 d'Ussone, 
who Commanded, was of the same Opinion with him and the rest of the Officers, and that they resolv'd to defend the Place to the last.


Upon this, the 
English
 immediately made their Approaches, and the next day, being the 20th, by break of day, the Besiegers attack'd a Fort upon a Hill, which commanded a Valley between the Town and them. The Granadiers that were drawn out for this Action, march'd with that silence, that they got to the soot of the 
Glacis,
 before they were discover'd by the Enemy; at what time delivering their Granadoes, they went on directly to the Pallisadoes, and entred the Fort without opposition, and made themselves Masters of it without the loss of one Man, the Enemy crying out for Quarter, which was readily granted.


Immediately the 
English,
 having thus taken the Fort, en∣trench'd themselves in the Valley; at what time the General hea∣ring that 
Baldarick O Donnel
 was on his march, in order to throw himself and and his Brigade into the Place, the Tin-Boats were immediately launch'd in the River, and six Regiments of Foot and four of Horse sent over the River, and posted full in the way where 
Baldarick
 was to pass: Who finding it impossible for him to bring about his Design, retreated with his Rabble into the Country of 
Mayo,
 burning and destroying all before him.

The taking this Fort, and crossing over the River so sudden∣ly, may well be thought to have frighted the Enemy into a Treaty; for upon the 21st, about ten in the Morning, the Go∣vernour sent for a safe Conduct for some Persons he intended to send to the General, in order to a Capitulation: Which being granted, three Lieurenant Collonels came forth as Hostages, in the Afternoon. The Treaty lasted the rest of the day and night, at what time the Commissioners were ublig'd to go back, and consult their Superior Officers. But at last it was agreed,


That the next 
Sunday,
 being the 26 of 
July,
 in the Morning, the Town should be deliver'd to such Officers as the General should appoint; and that in the mean time five Hostages should be deliver'd to the Besiegers, for due performance of Articles; and that all the Out-works of the Town should be put into their hands.


That the Enemy should forbear to fortifie in the mean time, and withdraw all their Cannon from the Walls; but that the Besiegers should be permitted to work and post themselves where they would, provided they came not within three yards of the Wall, nor planted any Cannon upon the Battery they made.


That the Garrison and Townsmen that remain'd behind, should have the Benefit of the Lords Justices Proclamation, which gives them their Estates and Liberties.


That they who had a mind to depart, should be conducted safe to 
Limerick,
 with their Arms, Drums beating, 
&c.
 with six Pieces of Cannon.


Lastly, That they shall have the liberty to send to the Lord 
Tyrconnel,
 to acquaint him with what they had done, and per∣swade him to do the same at 
Limerick.


According to this Capitulation, they sent the Lord 
Clanriccard,
 and four Officers more, for Hostages, and allow'd two Persons appointed by the General, to enter into the Place, and take an account of the Stores, 
&c.


Thus upon the 26th of 
July
 was the City of 
Galloway
 actually surrendred, the Garrison marching out in the Morning, and 
a'Ʋssone,
 the 
French
 Lieutenant-General, departing the Town two or three hours before the rest, as it were 
Incognito;
 being a Civi∣lity desired by the Monsieur, and with no less Generosity allow'd by General 
Ginkle;
 who as soon as the Town was clear of the Rebels, put into it three Regiments of Foot, under the Command 
 Sir 
Henry Bellasis.


Galloway
 being thus reduc'd, upon the 28th of 
July,
 the 
Eng∣lish
 Army set forward from thence toward 
Portumney,
 where the great Cannon for Battery was to meet them from 
Athlone:
 And there it was that the General receiv'd advice, That Captain 
Coale,
 with a Squadron of 
English
 and 
Dutch
 Men of War, and the Provision and Ammunition-Ships from 
Kinsale,
 was arriv'd be∣fore 
Galloway;
 upon which, the General order'd him imme∣diately to sail away for the 
Shannon.
 From 
Athernee,
 the Army advanc'd to 
Banabar
-Bridge, where they were joyn'd by seven Regiments more that lay Quarter'd in those parts; and while the General stay'd there, a great number of Draught-Horses were taken up, in order to carty Provision and Ammunition to the Camp. At the same time also, several Deserters came from the Enemy; who gave an account, That the 
French
 that were in 
Limerick,
 had been endeavouring to get off a Night or two be∣fore; but perceiving several 
English
 Ships in the mouth of the River, they return'd back again. They further inform'd, that there were above twenty Merchant Ships and two Privateers, all laden and bound for 
France.
 Whereupon Orders were sent to Cap∣tain 
Coale,
 who commanded the Squadron then lying in the 
Shan∣non,
 to take care to secure those Vessels, and prevent their get∣ting out.


Upon the 3d of 
August,
 the 
English
 decampt from 
Banabar,
 and the same day Brigadier 
Leveson,
 with 500 Horse and Dra∣goons, got before, and in the Evening came to 
Nenagh;
 upon whose approach, the Governour, Brigadier 
Carroll
 quitted the Place in great haste, having first set it on fire; which, however, it was soon put out, by eleven of the 
English,
 who hapned to be Prisoners there, and were left behind.


On the 6th of 
August,
 Collon
l 
Mitchelhourn
 having block'd up 
Slego
 on both sides, the Governour Sir 
Teague O Regan,
 sub∣mitted to a Capitulation, and sign'd Articles the same day, to surrender the Town by the 15th next ensuing. But afterwards, out of that same treacherous Inconstancy, natural to the meer 
Irish,
 he refused to yield upon the Capitulations he had sign'd. So that a more numerous Force was drawn out, and sent away to joyn with 3000 of the 
Militia,
 to bring him to another sort of Re∣pentance.


At the same time also 
Baldaric O Donnel,
 sormerly a Collonel in 
Spain,
 and said to be the true Earl of 
Tyrconnel,
 whose Name has hitherto made a great Noise among the superstitious 
Irish,
 that pin their Faith upon Prophecies, sent to the General a Proposal

of some Conditions which he desired might be granted to him and his Followers, upon their laying down their Arms; and that for the present, an Article for a Cessation might be allow'd him, for continuing unmolested with his Men, in some place to be assign'd him, till their Majesties Pleasure should be known con∣cerning his Demands.


Upon the 7th or 8th of 
August,
 the 
Militia
 of the County of 
Cork
 made an Incursion into the Rebels Quarters, beyond 
Ban∣try,
 under the Command of Collonel 
Beecher,
 and Lieutenant-Collonel 
Moore;
 who in their march to joyn with Lieutenant-Collonel 
Freek,
 Lieutenant Collonel 
Roberts,
 Major 
Wade,
 and Major 
Morris,
 met with a Body of the Enemy, consisting of 400 Men, near 
Skibberteine,
 which they presently defeated, kil∣ling above 60, and taking several Prisoners. Which done, they joyn'd the rest of the Party; and making up 500 in all, march'd toward a place where they were inform'd that 
Mac-Car∣ry Moore,
 and 
O Danavan,
 lay with their Regiments; and with great difficulty got over a Pass, which the Rebels might have defended with 20 Men, against 2000. Which put the Ene∣my into such a Consternation, that they betook themselves to their Heels, in so great a confusion, that they left behind, for a Prey to the 
English,
 a thousand Head of Black Cattle, five hun∣dred Garrans, as many Goats, two thousand Sheep, and store of other Booty.


Much about the same time, a Vessel, on board of which w
 
St. Ruth
's Goods and Plunder, attempting to get out of the 
Shan∣non,
 was taken by one of their Majesties Frigats that was cruiz∣ing about the Mouth of the River; at what time two other Ships, in which were 
Sarsfield
's Lady, and some other Persons of Quality, observing, as good luck for them would have it, the Misfortune of the first Vessel, return'd back to 
Limerick.


Upon the 11th of 
August,
 the General march'd from 
Nenagh
 
o 
Shadey,
 about two Miles from the Silver Mines. The next day he advanc'd to 
Tullen,
 and upon the 14th, to 
Caricken-Lysh,
 which is about four Miles from 
Limerick.


Upon the 15th, the General went with 1500 Horse and Dra∣goons, within sight of the Town; and having beaten in the Ene∣mies out Guards, took a view of the Rebels Works, from the Hills where their Majesties Artillery was lodg'd the last Year.




On the 16th, being 
Sunday,
 the Earl of 
Tyrconnel,
 who depar∣ted this Life the 
Friday
 before, as it was certainly said, out of meer Anguish of Mind, to see the ruinous Condition of his Ma∣ster's Affairs, was buried at 
Limerick;
 who being thus laid in his Grave, a Commission was produc'd from the late King, which Mr. 
Plowden,
 formerly one of the Commissioners of the Revenue in 
Ireland,
 had brought but a little before from 
France,
 appoine ting Sir 
Alexander Fitton,
 Sir 
Richard Neagle,
 and the said Mr. 
Plowden,
 Justices of 
Ireland;
 who immediately, by virtue of the same Commission, took upon 'em to act, within the narrow Confines of 
Limerick,
 as Lords Justices of that Kingdom.


At the same time Collonel 
Henry Lutterell
 had been seiz'd by order of the 
French
 Lieut. gen. 
d'Ʋssone,
 for having made some Proposals for a Surrender; and was sentenc'd, by a Court-Martial, to be shot to Death. Of which General 
Ginckle
 being inform'd, sent word to the 
French
 Monsieur by a Trumpet, That if any Man were put to death for having a Mind to come over to the 
English,
 he would revenge it double upon the 
Irish
 Prisoners.


August
 25. The 
English
 Army drew near 
Limerick,
 and drove the Enemy from all their several Forts and Places of defence with∣out the Town; of which they quitted some upon the approach of the 
English.
 Nevertheless, in another Fort which they had new∣ly built, and wherein they had six hundred Men, they made a shew of greater Resistance; but upon the advance of fourscore Granadiers to attack it, they only gave one general discharge up∣on 'em, and then made a running Retreat by a Covert-way, within their Flank Lines, which they had newly raised round about the Town.


The next Morning, a considerable Detachment of Horse and Foot was sent away, with some Cannon, under the Command of the Prince of 
Hesse-Dermstadt,
 to take in 
Castle-Connel,
 where the Enemy had a strong Garrison: And another Party was sent to reduce three other Castles, in the Enemies possession, that lay upon the River below the Town.


Upon the 25th of 
August,
 the whole Army decamping from 
Carrick-
glish,
 about three in the Afternoon came before 
Lime∣rick,
 the left Wing reaching to the River; but in regard the Enemy had planted two Pieces of Cannon on the other side of the River, to the Disadvantage of the 
English,
 a Regiment of Dra∣goons, and another of Horse, that were posted: nearest to the Banks of the Stream, were constrain'd to remove to a little far∣ther

distance out of Harm's way. Being thus come before the
 Town, the 
English
 advanc'd to 
Cromwel
 Fort, without any oppo∣sition, the Enemy quitting both that and the Line of Commu∣nication, which they had made to the Church, and retreating to their Intrenchments that were nearer the Town. And at the same time, a Derachment of fourscore Granadiers were imme∣diately order'd to attack one of their Out-works, which was a new Fort, and guarded by six hundred Men; which upon the advancing of the 
English,
 they abandon'd after one single dis∣charge, and fled by the Covert-way into the Town. Upon which, the Granadiers entred the Fort; and pursuing the Fugi∣tives, kill'd several, and took about twenty Prisoners, with the loss of no more than one Man. Only one unhappy Accident sell out that night, that Collonel 
Donep
 of the 
Danish
 Horse, was un∣fortunately slain by a Random-shot.


The 26th the heavy Cannon and Mortars arriv'd, and the Souldiers began to work upon the Lines of Communication.


The 27th a Battery was raised by the Besiegers against 
Tho∣mond
 Bridge; and the same day Lieutenant-General 
Scraven∣more
 was sent with a Detachment to reduce 
Castle O Gunnel,
 which presently surrendred at discretion; so that the whole Garrison, consisting of a hundred and fifty Men, were all made Prisoners of War. At the same time some lighter 
English
 Frigats made up, and cast Anchor within sight of the Town, while Captain 
Cole
 with the rest of the Squadron lay about six Miles off. 'Tis said that the Besieged, upon the first appearance of the small Frigats, expressed an extraordinary Joy, believing them to have been 
French;
 but were as much appall'd, when they found their unlucky Mistake.


The 28th 
Castle-Connel
 surrendred to the Prince of 
Hesse-Derm∣stadt,
 which was attended with the surrender of several other petty Castles thereabout, and made the 
English
 Masters of above nine hundred Prisoners.


Upon the 30th the Besiegers began to play upon the Town with nine Mortars, which set it on fire in several places, though it burnt not very long, the Buildings being all of Stone, and very strong. However, the second Bomb that was thrown kill'd the Lady 
Dillon,
 and wounded several others. The next day nine Cannon began to play upon the Castle to ruin it, and to hin∣der the Enemies Communication with their Camp; and the same night was erected a Battery of two Mortars more, of eighteen

Inches diameter; and soon after two more Batteries were finish'd, one of fourteen Pieces, the other of ten, all carrying twenty four and eighteen pound Ball. The Report of all the Deserters, who daily came over to the Leaguer, at that time was, that the Gar∣rison in the Town was very numerous, but that they were not half arm'd, and that they were in great want of Previsions. But though it is not amiss for a General to hear what such People say, yet there is but little Credit to be given to their Reports, which are most frequently fram'd to curry favour. Thus in a few days after, other Deserters reported, That there were not Provisions in the Town for many days, and that 
d'Ʋssone
 the 
French
 Go∣vernour, had promised to dismiss the Militia that were forced in∣to the Town, after the Battel of 
Aghrim,
 if succour did not come from 
France
 in twelve days. Of the Truth of all which, an easie Conjecture may be made by what has hapned since.


However, after all these fair Stories, the General hearing that several Regiments of the Enemies Horse, with a Party of 
Rap∣parees,
 were drawn together in 
Kerry,
 about sixteen Miles from 
Limerick,
 sent away Brigadier 
Leveson
 with five hundred Horse and Dragoons, in pursuit of the whole Party; who being inform'd of his March, divided themselves into two Bodies, to make their retreat the more easie. Which Brigadier 
Leveson
 understanding, did the like; and with one part of his Detachment, himself pur∣sued one of the Enemies Bodies, while Collonel 
Newenhuys
 pur∣su
d the other. Nor was it long before the Brigadier overtook the Party which he pursu'd; and so entirely put them to the rout, that very few escap'd; among the rest, the Lord 
Castle Con∣nel
 was taken, and sent to the Camp with the rest of the Pri∣soners.


Upon the 3d of 
September,
 the Enemies Horse quitted their Camp, under the Cannon of the Town, and betook themselves to another that lies in the Road between 
Limerick
 and 
Killalow;
 and thus their Horse being near to second 'em, they posted four Regiments of Dragoons to guard the Fords of the 
Shannon,
 in case the Enemy should attempt to pass the River. On the other side, the Besiegers had by this time finish'd their Line of Circum∣vallation, with four Redoubts to defend it.


September
 4. Three hundred Horse and Dragoons were sent to re-inforce Brigadier 
Leveson;
 who after the Defeat of the two Regiments, and the Body of 
Rapparees,
 in 
Kerry,
 was advanc'd farther, in order to the reducing of those few small Garrisons

which the 
Irish
 had left in that County; to which purpose, is Pieces of Cannon were also order'd him for the more speedy ef∣fecting his Design.


About the same time, the 
Irish
 having put between 2 and 300 of the Protestant Inhabitants of 
Limerick
 into a little Island in the 
Shannon,
 under a sufficient Guard, their sad and starving Condition mov'd the Compassion of the Officers, to whose care they were committed; who being no less desirous themselves to go over to the 
English,
 sent to Maj. 
Stroud,
 who then lay posted with some of the 
Melitia
 not far from the Island, to let him understand their intentions; upon which, the Major went over with a Party in small Boats; and brought away not only the Guard, but the Pri∣soners, that were almost starv'd for want of Food, in a place where they had only two pitiful Hutts to shelter them from the Inconveniences of the Weather.


Septemb.
 8. The great Battery of 22 Pieces of Cannon began to play very early in the Morning, and in a short time made a Breach of about 30 yards in the 
English
 Town, on the North-East side of it. Upon the left of this Battery were also planted 8 Mor∣tars, two of which were 18 Inches in diameter. The next day, be∣ing the 9th, two more Batteries were finish'd, which play'd upon St. 
John
's Gate in the 
Irish Town.
 These Batteries and Mortars playing without intermission, made a world of Havock, dismoun∣ted the Enemies Cannon, made several Breaches, set the 
English Town
 several times on fire, and laid the greatest part of it in Rub∣bish; and all this by the 12th at night; at what time some of the Besiegers Bombs falling among the Enemies Stores, burnt three of their Magazines, one of Brandy, and the other two of Bisker, and shortly after fired and blew up another Magazine of Powder, which forc'd the Enemy to remove what Provisions and Am∣munition they had left, into the 
Irish Town.


Septemb.
 15. The Lord 
Lisburn
 was kill'd by a Cannon Ball, as he was lying upon his Quilt in the Trenches.


On the 17. One Capt. 
Taffe
 came over to the 
English,
 and inform'd the General, that the 
English Town
 was utterly ruin'd; that the great Guns and Bombs had kill'd a great number of the Garrison, which at that time was reduc'd to 6000 Foot, and those but very ill clad.


Upon the 
18th.
 an Express was sent to 
Dublin
 by the Earl of 
Granard,
 giving this Accompt, that upon his com∣ing before 
Slego
 with a Body of the Army, and Militia of the Country, consisting of about 3000 Men, to whom 
Baldaric

neale,
 who was absolutely come over to the 
English,
 had joyned his own Thou∣sand followers, the Irish quitted the Town, and retreated into the Fort; up∣on which his Lordship caus'd a Battery to be Rais'd against it. But then the Irish chusing rather to submit in time, then suffer the fatal Effects of a suc∣cessful Storm, surrender'd the Fort upon the 
15th.
 of 
September,
 and Marched out accordingly to the Number of between 5 or 600 Men. They left in the Place 16 Pieces of Cannon, 30 Barrels of Powder, more Shot in proportion, and a great Quantity of Provision. The Articles they obtain'd were almost the same with those that were granted to 
Galloway,
 wherein divers other pet∣ty Garisons were included, upon this Condition that they furrendr'd twenty four Hours after being Summon'd. Much about the same time, General 
Ginckle
 having determined that part of the Army should pass the 
Shannon,
 with a re∣solution to dissipate or remove the Irish Horse that lay Encamped in the Coun∣ty of 
Clare,
 and shut up the Town on that side also, the better to conceal his design, made a shew by giving Orders to draw off and ship the heavy Cannon, and quit several Castles near the Camp, as if he intended to raise the Siege; which the Enemy believing to be real, expressed their joy by loud and frequent∣ly repeated Shouts. But the same Night the 
Pontons
 were laid over the 
Shan∣non
 about a Mile above the Town; which was perform'd with that Order and Silence, that upon the 
16th.
 by break of day, the Royal Regiment of Dra∣goons, with a Detachment both of Horse and Foot had pass'd the River be∣fore they were discover'd by the Enemy. All this while Brigadier 
Clifford
 lay with four Regiments of Dragoons on the other side of the Water, to have hinder'd the 
English
 from getting over; and so soon as he perceiv'd himself frustrated in his design; brought down all his Men on foot (their horses being at grass) to make the best opposition he could. But they were presently routed, and forc'd to betake themselves to their Heels, flinging away their Arms, and leaving behind them all their Tents. Baggage, Saddles, Bridles and other Accoutrements, together with two Pieces of Cannon, and the Standard of 
Maxwell.
 Many were kill'd, and several taken Prisoners, among whom was a French Lieutenant Collonel. Upon this, the rest of the Irish Horse, that lay higher up towards 
Ki
lalow,
 took the 
Alarum,
 and drew out as if they had intended some stout resistance, but as it prov'd, 'twas only to secure their Baggage, and get time to take down their Tents. For so soon as the 
En∣glish
 drew near 'em, and had pass'd the first Lane that was between the Irish and Them, they March'd off in great disorder toward the Mountains. Which done, the Horse return'd to the Camp, and the Foot were posted at the head of the Bridge. At what time the 
English
 also took a Castle that stands in the Middle of the 
Shannon,
 the Garison of which consisting of about three-score Men, surrender'd at discretion; besides another Post not far from it which were of great Use to the Besiegers. The 
English
 also remov'd their Bridge of Boats nearer to the Town, and secur'd two more Passes to it, of which one was call'd the Pass of 
Annabegg,
 where the 
English
 went over the last year.


On the 22d. of 
September
 the General of the 
English
 passed the 
Shannon
 very early in the Morning with a strong Party of Horse and Dragoons, and Ten Regiments of Infantry, and fourteen Pieces of Cannon, leaving the rest of the Army under the Command of the Duke of 
Wittenbergh
 to secure the Be∣siegers Works on the other side of the River. About Noon the same day, both Horse and Foot were drawn up before the 
Irish
 Town, notwithstand∣ing that the Enemy play'd upon 'em all the while from the Castle, and seve∣ral Towers, both with their great Guns and small Shot. About four of the Clock in the Afternoon, the General Order'd all the Granadeers together with the Regiments of Collonel 
Kirk,
 Collonel 
Yiffin,
 and the Lord 
George Hamilton
 to Advance and Attack the Fort that secures 
Thomend
 Bridge; at what time the Besieged sent two great Detachments out of the Town, to re∣inforce

and second their own Party that defended it. But notwithstanding all this, the 
English
 went on with that Courage and Bravery, that they beat the Enemy from their Works, who thereupon fled to the Town in hopes to have been let in. But the Governour fearing least the Victorious 
English
 should have Enter'd with the fugitives, durst not let down the draw Bridge to receive them, which occasion'd a great slaughter of the vanquish'd Irish, so that nothing was to be seen from the foot or 
Thomond
 Bridge to the draw Bridge, but heaps of dead Bodies. Six hundred of the Enemy were slain, and about one handred and thirty raken Prisoners, among which Number was Collonel 
kelton
 (since dead of his wounds) two Lieutenant Collonels, two Majors, three Captains, seven Lieutenants and six Ensigns. The loss which the 
En∣glish
 sustain'd was occasion'd more by their own Contempt of Danger, and too eager pursuit of Victory, than the Resistance of the Enemy. For all the while the conflict endur'd, the Enemy play'd with their Great and Small Shot from the Walls of the Town at a more than ordinary Rate: which was the rea∣son that the Mettle of the 
English
 precipitating them too far, they were much more than they needed to have been, expos'd to the Enemies Fire: so that between two and three hundred were slain and wounded, tho not any one of Remark.


The next day in the Afternoon the Garison beat a Parley on both sides of the 
River,
 and desir'd a Truce, which was agreed upon by the General; which time being expir'd, 
Sarsfield
 and 
Wahop
 came forth, and desir'd the Truce might be continu'd for three days, to the End they might send to their Horse, which lay toward 
Clare,
 to know upon what Conditions they expected to be comprehend∣ed in the Capitulation.


Upon the 
25th.
 Collonel 
Sheldon,
 and some other of the Enemies Officers came into the 
English
 Camp, and thence went into 
Limerick.
 The next Day 
S
rsfield
 and 
W
hop
 din'd with the General; and the Lord 
Cutts,
 Sir 
David Collier,
 Collonel 
Tiffany
 and Collonel 
Fiper
 were sent as Hostages into the Town, and the Lords 
Westmeath, lveagh, Trimblestown
 and 
Lowth,
 remain'd in the Camp as Hostages for the Garison. Upon the 
27th.
 the 
Irish
 sent out their Proposals, which the General not approving, instead of an Answer, sent back twelve other Articles, which was all he would allow them; and at the same time gave Orders for the great Guns and Mortars to be in a rea
ness, in case they resas'd the Proposals he had sent; which brought down the Stomac
