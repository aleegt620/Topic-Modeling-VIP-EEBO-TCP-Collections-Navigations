THE LIFE OF Admirall 
De Ruyter.


ARts in all ages have had their Chiefs and Grandecs, who by inventing of new, or improving of old devi∣ces, have been esteemed whilst a∣live, and renowned after death. And as their attempts were no o∣therwise to be valued but as the prevailing 
genius
 of their times weighed the uses of them so seve∣ral ages according to their predo∣minating measures, have placed,

or displaced their Artists in the 
Classis
 and Register of fame; which ought indeed to be the Royal Stan∣dard of such Worthies praise; though fond Posterity either over-affected with the advantages of their own, or not throughly in∣formed of the usefulness of elder-atchivements, do for the most part unjustly rank the Illustrious of former times in that order; that these have the precedency who seem most to favour the preroga∣tive of the present applauded pra∣ctices: when antiquated contri∣vances being tryed by a true sur∣vey of their profitableness when they Flourished, and the advances they gained beyond their respe∣ctive Predecessors, may appear to have made as high a rise above their antecedent hints, as our Great Guns excell the Roman bat∣tering Rams, or our roaring Trumpet-speaker, old bauling 
Sten∣tor,
 who now with the great He∣roes

of distant ages are sent again to School,


Ʋt pueris placeant & declamatio fi∣ant.


The Masters of the Military Art as well as others, being obnoxious to this severe and partiall Judge∣ment, the contemporaries of great men have in all ages laboured to vindicate the honour of their He∣roes, by bringing to a fair tryal of their Countrey, the attainments and feats of such as they (the only competent Judges) thought wor∣thy to be listed in the Roll of Fame: and to crown them with such Verdant Bayes as nothing but a hotter season of newer attempts, and more taking discoveries, could ever blast or wither: And as care∣ful Navigators in coasting of new∣found Lands, or Ingenious Pain∣ters at the view of some rare and surprising beauty, fail not to make

some transient designes of the new objects; that either misfortune might not altogether deprive the world of them, or that the curio∣sity of others who should have bet∣ter opportunities might be raised to finish and compleat their in∣tended draughts: So in all times some have been, who have left to posterity the true and natural proportions and more discerna∣ble lineaments of the actions of famous men, which others who lived nearer them might fill up and imbellish with the several colours and shaddows of smaller occurrences. Now since our Age hath brought forth as many (if not more) Instances of this na∣ture, then any past, and rewar∣ded them with as suitable ho∣nours and titles, as the most tri∣umphant times whatsoever: I thought it not amisse at this time, when every little Ale and Coffee-house 
Virtuoso
 comes blustering

upon us from the press; to give the world a view of the Life and Death of the late Renowned Sea-General 
Michael Ad. de Ruyter
 Lieutenant-Admiral of the States of the United Netherlands, whose rare Endowments and memora∣ble Exploits have rendred him parallel to his most famed Com∣petitors, and the high pitch to which he grew from so low a root, more conspicuous then all: wherein if every little period of the several vicissitudes and chan∣ges of his fortune, be not so di∣stinctly and punctually handled, as might be expected from an ex∣act Diary, or 
Memoires
 (which is not the intent of this Treatise;) yet the more observable Circum∣stances of his whole life, partly from Relations of his own mouth, and partly from the authentick Te∣stimonies of Witnesses & Records, shall be faithfully collected to the satisfaction of every Reader.




DUring the Wars betwixt the Spaniards and Dutch in 
Flan∣ders,
 there served for some years the States of 
Holland,
 in quality of a private Trooper (a stranger by some judged a scottish man, so little known by his family, that his profession gave him his Sir∣name,) the happy Father of this brave man; who (being disban∣ded from, or displeased with that course of life;) with his wife, his only then childe 
Michael Ad. de Ruyter,
 born to him at 
Flushing
 in 
Zealand,
 (the subject of this present Discourse,) and serving∣maid, being the whole of his Fa∣mily, retired himself to a Coun∣trey-house at two miles distance from 
Bergen ap Zome,
 and there to the quieter employment of a husbandmans life: where by his industrous endeavours, with two horses, the greatest part of his substance, in the usuall labour

of that Countrey, he supplied the wants of his family with care and pains: but neither the low∣ness of the poor mans fortune (which commonly begets either contempt or pity) nor yet the priviledge of his person, as ha∣ving sometime served under the same Ensignes; could secure him or his beasts from the vio∣lence of licentious Souldiers: his two horses are taken from him by force; and carried to the Dutch Camp in 
Flanders,
 by some of the Troopers of that Ar∣my: this loss was too considera∣ble to be neglected by him, who thereby saw himself and family utterly ruined: He therefore ha∣stens after them to the camp; but finding his addresses for justice fruitless, by the delays and neglect of the Officers, and being well ac∣quainted with the proceedings of loosly disciplined or ill-paid Ar∣mies, where the Commanders

either share in, or connive at the rapine of the Souldiers: he resol∣ved on a speedier and more effectu∣al way of reparation, by stealing from robbers what they had un∣justly forced from him: And so having discovered where his hor∣ses were at grass, watching his opportunity, he secretly conveyed them away, and left them in a place somewhat remote from his own house, where he judged them farthest from danger, foreseeing (as indeed it happened) that these new Masters would not fail to look after the strays. The souldiers mis∣sing there booty, and concluding that the owner had them, returned in the night with a purpose to finde them at his house; but being by his provident care disappointed; in barbarous revenge they set on fire the poor single thatcht Cot∣house about the ears of the help∣less Inhabitants; In the horrour of this sudden surprise, whilst

the father, mother and servant save themselves, by breaking through the merciless flames, with that care of self-preserva∣tion, which is common to all creatures, and astonishment, usu∣al in such unexpected frights; the poor harmless childe the fu∣ture darling of 
Neptune,
 lay at the mercy of devouring 
Vulcan
 fast asleep in an upper room, swadled in his cradle; but the flames of Parental love towards an only childe, stronger than those of fire, soon scorcht the mothers heart with so great ap∣prehensions of the danger of her Son; that aided by that provi∣dence which saved the Children in the fiery furnace, with more than masculine courage, she threw her self into the house a∣gain, to save or die with that childe, by whose life and death fortune had decreed her honour: and having in her petticoat,

through smoke and flames, got into the upper Room, first threw the childe out of the window in∣to a sheet held by the father and maid to receive him, and after∣ward jump't out her self, saving from that little 
Troy
 her young 
Aeneas.
 So cross and unlucky are many times the beginnings of virtuous Men, and low the 
basis
 of Fames 
Pyramides,
 misery being commonly the first step to happiness, and a gloomy morning the portal of a fair day: Having thus happily avoided the Fury of this cruel Element, though stript of all, naked as truth it self, the disconsolate Fa∣ther in this so great uncertainty, finding no other hopes of relief but the Charity of the Merciful, betook himself with his wretch∣ed Family to 
Bergen ap Zome
 the next Town of Note, where arri∣ving early in the morning, he presented to his compassionate

Countreymen a lamentable spe∣ctacle of his new disaster:


The commendable care of that Countrey in providing for the Necessities of the indigent, either by maintaining of the infirm and impotent, or by imploying the stronger and those that are able, to work: afforded means for the poor man to subsist and feed his family; untill his young son being grown up to the state of a boy, able to do somewhat for himself, was placed in the rope∣ground of the Heer 
Lampson
 in 
Flushing,
 a considerable Mer∣chant; who had a Manufactory of Ropes there: The poor childe complying with the condition which he could not alter, with several other boys of his own rank and age, dilligently follow∣ed, his business in spinning of rope-yarn, and other drudgeries of that vocation to the content of his Overseers; until some time

after, the Heer 
Lampson
 himself coming into the rope-ground, and eying the lad; his fancy suggested to him (observing the features and carriage of the boy) the unsuitableness of that trade to the 
genius
 of the lad: and finding upon examination the forwardness of his wit, and con∣fident readiness in his answers, and his willingness to leave that course, and to serve him in some other capacity; he released him from that slavery, and sent him to school; where in a short time he gave such pregnant proofs of his parts and industry, that his Master finding his pro∣ficiency ripe for employment, prudently at first intrusted him with the charge of keeping of the accounts of his family-expen∣ces, that so he might the bet∣ter have a tryal of the youths abilities, and prevent the er∣rours, into which higher ad∣vancement

and distance of place often misleads unexperienced be∣ginners; imitating herein the example of Falconers, who use first to call their hawks to their fists with a guard, before they venture them at large to the lure: In this office he carried himself with so great fidelity and discretion, and thereby gained so great esteem from his Master; that he advanced him to be his book-keeper, and to the management of his Mer∣chant-affairs: wherein being likewise much satisfied with his skill and diligence; he pitched upon him as a person every way qualified for a Factor in his trade in 
Ireland,
 which consisted in but∣ter, herrings, tallow and hides: and accordingly sent him to 
Dublin;
 There he lived seven years under the inspection of Mr 
Cremor,
 Mr 
Vanhorn,
 Mr 
Wi∣born,
 and some others of his

Masters Correspondents; during which space, besides his attain∣ing of the English Tongue (ve∣ry necessary to him who was af∣terward to treat so often with the English in their own Lan∣guage) he gave so great proofs of his dexterity in the conduct of affairs of Trading, and of his faithfulness to his trust, and thereby so much content to his Master and Correspondents; that by them he was sent into the 
Streights,
 to negotiate as 
Supercargo
 of their Concerns there. And whilst in his several Voyages from Port to Port in those parts, he successfully improved his traffick to the profit both of his Master and himself; being a na∣tural enemy to idleness, and an Unactive life, and totally averse from the lazy and bruitish re∣vellings of the most part of Sea∣men; he had leisure to rub up those few impressions and hints

of the Mathematicks, and parti∣cularly Navigation, which he had learned when a boy: where∣in by the ripeness of his wit, his constant pains and study, and the assistance of some Artists, in a short time he made such lau∣dable progress; that he not only became able to conduct any Ship himself, but obtained a great Name amongst Navigators. And having afterward made several Voyages into the 
Streights
 and 
Barbary,
 upon the account of the Heer 
Lampson
 his Master and Be∣nefactor, with constant good for∣tune and applause, he married a Widow, and setled himself in 
Flushing
 in 
Zealand.


The many good services which he had performed to his Master, and the reputation gained in his Sea-expeditions, began to plain the way to his preferment: In the year 1650. the dayly dam∣mages received from the 
Corsairs


of 
Argiers,
 the enemies of the 
Hollanders,
 being so sensible, that thereby the 
Mediterranean
 Trade, of great advantage to that Nati∣on, was much obstructed: the States (for the security of their Merchants) resolved to send Convoys with their Ships: the Heer 
Lampson
 laying hold of this opportunity to serve his Coun∣trey, and at the same time to show his love and gratitude to his friend, by the cheapest, and yet most noble way of reward; so effectually recommended Mr 
De Ruyter
 to the 
States General,
 that he obtained for him a Com∣mission to be Captain of a Man of War appointed by them, as a Convoy for their Merchant-men in the 
Streights,
 those fatal Nar∣row Seas, the Hercules-pillars of his life and honour, where he began and ended his Sea-prefer∣ment; and gave the first and last proofs of his Conduct and Va∣lour.




In this expedition he had the Occasion to lay the foundation of his future greatness, first, by rendring himself remarkable in his Command, and next in his Estate, the two usual handmaids of rising fortunes: for as by his Valour and Conduct in many successful Engagements with these Pirates, he procured the one, so by his lawful and honest endeavours, he missed not of the other. Insomuch that his Name being grown publick in 
Holland,
 by the dayly characters of those who had been obliged by his care and good offices; the States began to think him worthy of some higher rank.


The Occasion was not long wanting to his more prosperous fortune, For in 
anno
 1652. the equal success of the two Neigh∣bouring Common-wealths of 
England
 (then too unhappily established) and the States of

the 
Ʋnited Netherlands
 more deep∣ly rooted; began to advance to the incompatible heighth of Su∣periority (which was as much as Supremacy) their pretensions on the Seas: And although their claims were as different as that of an old possessor from a new intruder; yet the younger Rival the 
Hollanders
 thinking their power not inferiour to the other, the 
English,
 who upon the ac∣count of long and uninterrup∣ted possession, demanded of them the usual submissions: resolved to dispute the right by force of Arms, and so broke forth a War; which for the eagerness of the parties, the frequency of engagements, and the undaun∣ted constancy of the adversaryes whilst it lasted; may justly take place of all which before that time enobled the Ocean. Now was Captain 
Michael Adr. De Ruyter
 (signalized for his good

services in the Mediterranean, and eyed by the States as a per∣son fit for greater action) called home: And whilst Old Admiral 
Van Trump
 (after the engage∣ment on the nineteenth of 
May,
 1652. with General 
Blake
 off of 
Dover
-rode, the first action of hostility in this war, where he was defeated with the loss of two Ships and many men) was equipping and preparing in 
Hol∣land
 his Fleet, and broom to sweep the Seas; 
De Ruyter
 with a squadron of Fifty Men of War was speeded out from 
Zealand,
 to Convoy the Merchant-men to the Westward out of danger; and to scowr the Seas of the English; who on that side rendred the Navigation unsafe: This great Fleet first appearing off of 
Bright Hamstead
 in 
Sussex,
 where they forced ashoar, and took several Barks, continued their course Westward by the back of

the 
Isle of Wight:
 Advice of this being brought to the pretended Parliament of 
England,
 Sir 
George Ayscue
 who then Commanded a Fleet of fourty Men of War in the West about 
Plymouth;
 was ordered to stretch over the Channel towards the Coast of 
France,
 to hinder, or at least dispute them their passage: this he accordingly obeying, on the sixth of 
August
 1652. the two Fleets came in sight; and about four in the afternoon, to blows; and here continued a sharp Fight, bravely maintained on both sides, till separated by night, both lay by: But 
De Ruyters
 chief business being to secure his Merchant-men, and Sir 
George
 not thinking it conveni∣ent to renew the Engagement: he carried off his Fleet without loss of a Ship.


The States acquainted with his good Conduct in this First Ex∣pedition,

appointed him his sta∣tion in the mouth of the Chan∣nel, to stop and seize all English Ships homeward or outward∣bound: There he discharged an English Ship that he had taken, upon condition that the Master should acquaint Sir 
George Ayscue,
 that he stayed for him, and would be glad to see him: but Sir 
George
 knowing well the prudence and valour of the Commander, and the humour of the 
Dutch,
 not rash to run any apparent risk on∣ly for ostentation of bravery, his own Fleet being inferior in num∣ber; and having received no new Orders from his Masters; returned no answer: This brisk carriage won 
De Ruyter
 a singu∣lar reputation of gallantry and good conduct from the States-Ge∣neral, but in particular manner from the States of 
Zealand:
 In this station he continued cruising, till 
De Witt
 with another consi∣derable

Fleet from 
Holland
 joyn∣ed him, on the Twenty fourth of 
September;
 and having recei∣ved six Plate ships with their convoy whom they expected from 
Cadiz,
 they both together set sail homewards.


General 
Blake
 returning with the English Fleet from 
Plymouth
 towards the 
Downs,
 discovered the Dutch Fleet commanded by 
De Witt
 and 
De Ruyter
 riding at the back of the 
Goodwin-Sands,
 after that they had sent their charge into 
Holland; Blake
 resol∣ved to have engaged them, but the winde blowing hard hindred his attempt then untill afterward; the season being more favourable on the Twenty eighth of 
October,
 with three Squadrons of Ships he made up to them; but fin∣ding them so well protected by the Sands amongst which they rode, and having run aground the 
So∣veraign
 and 
Resolution,
 (which

were presently got off again) in his too rash approach with the great Ships, he was forced to de∣sist. 
De Witt
 and 
De Ruyter
 in the entry of a War being ashamed thus to be braved, voluntarily left their advantagious station, came forth and fought the Eng∣lish; but with so great loss, that notwithstanding all the cou∣rage and conduct employed by the two Admiralls during the action, they were forced to run, leaving many Ships burnt and sunk; and were pursued by the English within twelve Leagues, E. S. E. of the 
Maes,
 on the Coast of 
Holland;
 till with the remainder of the Fleet shattered and torn 
de Wit
 and 
de Ruyter
 got into 
Goree.
 The 
Hollanders
 im∣puted their ill successe in this Fight to the over-match of the English, and the cowardise of some of their Captains, who did not fight; but experience hath

since demonstrated, that the pru∣dent use which the cautious 
De Ruyter
 made of the misfortune, was never to forsake an advantagi∣ous station till a more advantagious opportunity of fighting offfered.


This Defeat spurr'd the 
Dutch
 on revenge: For on the Nine and twentieth of 
November
 following, old 
Van Trump
 and Vice-Admiral 
De Ruyter
 with a Fleet of Eighty Men of War, and Ten Fire-ships put to Sea again, and finding Ge∣neral 
Blake
 at his station with a number far inferiour, not much exceeding fourty Sail, but with equal resolution to fight: 
Van Trump
 and 
De Ruyter
 made up towards him, and he not shrinking, there began a hot and bloudy combat, obstinatly maintained for some time; but the disparity of num∣ber being unreasonably great, the English were routed, and the Garland-Frygat taken: In this Fight 
De Ruyter
 sustained much

dammage in his Ship, and lost many men, having been observed as forward in the Engagement as any, and as long in action.


The Dutch in the mean time kept the Seas, cruising in the Channel off of the 
Isle of Wight,
 whilst 
Blake
 impatient of long delay, having with great expedi∣tion fitted and reinforced his Fleet: the Eight of 
February
 1653. set sail from 
Quinborough
 with sixty Men of War, intending to joyn twenty more at 
Portsmouth.
 These keen Competitors seemed only to withdraw a little, and take breath, that with greater force, and fury, they might renew their onset, as it proved shortly after: For 
Van Trump
 be∣ing sailed according to his Or∣ders to the Westward, to attend and Convoy a Numerous and Rich Fleet of Merchant-men, coming from the 
Streights,
 and other Southern parts; and on

the eleventh of 
February
 General 
Blake
 having joyned the 
Portsmouth
 Fleet at 
Beachy-head,
 he sailed the height of 
Portland,
 and there lay cross the 
Channel,
 expecting the coming of the 
Dutch:
 On the Eighteenth, about break of day, were discovered 
Van Trump
 and 
De Ruyter
 with their Fleet, to the number of between three and four hundred Sail, Men of War and Merchant-men: The English stoutly bore up and en∣gaged them, and were with no less valour received by the Dutch; but 
Blake
 resolving to make them sensible, that it was not their courage, but number, which had given the English the former ruffle; pressed them with such irresistable courage and force, that they were forced to run, and with great loss to get home; yet the conduct and cou∣rage of 
Van Trump
 and 
De Ruy∣ter
 was so remarkable in bringing

off the Merchant-men; that both merited and received special and publick thanks from the States.


By this time the Hollanders having by fresh experience lear∣ned the danger of tempting the Lion even in his den, resolved no more to hazard their Mer∣chant-men in the Channel; but judged the farthest way about to be the nearest way home; and so having ordered them to re∣turn by the back of 
Ireland
 and 
Scotland;
 Leiutenant Admiral 
Van Trump
 and Vice-Admiral 
De Ruyter
 were set out from the 
Texel
 with Eighty Men of War to meet and Convoy a Fleet of Two hundred Sail of Merchant∣men coming that way from 
France:
 which being successful∣ly effected without interruption from the English then in the 
Downs,
 they kept out at sea expe∣cting their Enemies. The English then being commanded by a tri∣umvirate

of Generals of equal and joynt authority, 
Blake, Dean,
 and 
Monck,
 on the second of 
Iune,
 came in sight of the Dutch Fleet, and about eleven or twelve of the Clock engaged them. It was fought till night with much blood and fierce reso∣lution; but the English accusto∣med to victory, having lost 
Dean,
 one of their Generals, ply∣ed them so warmly, that they thought it safest to fly to 
Blanck∣enburgh;
 General 
Monck
 pursu∣ing them at the heels to seven fathom water. During the whole fight Vice-Admiral 
De Ruyter
 and Rear-Admiral 
Lawson
 on the English side, having singled themselves out, fought singly with such courage and emulati∣on as might be expected from two Commanders of so much Fame and Honour.


Hardly can there be shown greater struglings for Victory,

or stiffer ambition for greatness, than appeared in the Dutch, du∣ring all this War; who the more they were beaten (like balls against a wall) the sooner they rebounded: About the lat∣ter end of 
Iuly, Van Trump
 and 
De Ruyter
 from 
Zealand,
 and 
De Witt
 from 
Holland,
 set out again to sea; and being joyned, made up a Fleet of Ninety Sail of Men of War, and ten Fireships. Gene∣ral 
Monck
 with a Fleet far less in number being then abroad, the twenty nineth of 
Iuly
 towards night came up with them: but the Master of his Ship fearing the enemies Fireships, and advi∣sing him not to venture an En∣gagement, the General in anger, and in terms more of a stout Commander, than expert Sea∣man; bid him 
Turn again:
 And so with prodigious courage gave them their last, and most fatal defeat, in these their Wars with

the Commonwealth of 
England:
 wherein besides the loss of Twenty six Men of War, their Admiral 
Van Trump
 ended his daies; and of all the Flagships of their Fleet only that of 
De Ruy∣ter
 had the fortune to come into Port with the Flag standing.


After the death of 
Van Trump, Opdam
 was made Admiral in his place, a Land-Souldier and Offi∣cer of Horse; the States proba∣bly thinking, that by matching the quality of their Admiral with that of the English General 
Monck;
 they might equal their fortune: 
De Witt
 Vice-Admiral, and 
De Ruyter
 Rear-Admiral of 
Holland.
 But whilst the 
Dutch
 are fitting for new action, though with somewhat slower procedure than formerly, their heat and strength being much, cooled and abated; there starts up in 
England
 a new Statholder; 
Oliver Cromwel
 General of the

Army made Protector of the Common-wealth. This New Usurper, knowing that his authority being forced, violent, and against nature, needed grea∣ter confirmation and support, than he could expect from the free and voluntary obedience of an overpowered people: and the States general finding them∣selves much weakened by the past War, they both understood one another so well, and their several interests, that about the latter end of 
January
 1653/4. a peace was concluded betwixt them, which at that time stopt the troubled humours, but remo∣ved not the causes of relapses.


After this peace, 
De Ruyter
 transports himself with his Wife, Son 
Engell De Ruyter,
 two daughters, and the rest of his family, from 
Flushing,
 where he had formerly lived, to 
Am∣sterdam,
 as the place of his fu∣ture

residence, and more con∣spicuous stage of Honour: but here he had hardly warmed his new House, when the States found new business for him in the 
Old Streights.
 The Pirates of these Seas after their wonted manner so incommoded Navi∣gation in these parts, that 
De Ruyter
 with a Squadron of Men of War in 
anno
 1654. was sent by the States to suppress and tame their insolency: In his Voyage thither he friendly met with his ancient enemy 
Blake,
 who then was in the 
Streights
 with a Fleet of Ships upon the account of the Protector and Commonwealth of 
England;
 where they saluted each other, shook hands, and parted in very good terms; and 
De Ruyter
 continuing his course to 
Argiers;
 in a short time so humbled the 
Corsairs
 of that place, 
Tripoli
 and 
Tunnis,
 that he brought them to a peace,

though of short duration, and so with honour and applause re∣turned back again to 
Holland:
 where shortly after a greater field of honour was designed for him.


Men that would be great and rich by hook and by crook, by potching, and fishing where sometime they should not; first grow envious and pettish, and then angry and quarrelsome with their thriving Neighbours. In the year 1657. the Victorious Arms of 
Swedland
 had lodged themselves in the very heart of 
Poland,
 threatning danger if not ruine to that Kingdom. The States of 
Holland
 fearing lest the prosperous success of that Crown with which their friendship and correspondence was always doubtful and uncertain, might keep bread from their butter, and much damnifie their traffick in the Baltick Sea: perswaded

the King of 
Denmark
 their anci∣ent Allie, who had more reason then force, to break with 
Swed∣land,
 promising him all assist∣ance to regain from that King what he had wrested and de∣tained from him some years be∣fore: This instance of the States-General so prevailed with him, that he declared War against the King of 
Swedland,
 and invaded his Kingdomes; wherewith the 
Swede
 being allarmed, was for∣ced to leave 
Poland,
 and with all his forces return home against the 
Dane.


The bad success which the 
Danes
 had in these Wars both by Sea and land, obliged the States of 
Holland
 to put a Fleet to Sea under the command of Admiral 
De Witt
 to assist them in the 
Sound;
 But his Fleet being by the 
Swedes
 there routed, the Admirals Ship the 
Bredrow
 sunk, and 
De Witt
 himself either killed or drowned:

a fresh Recruit was dispatched with Admiral 
Opdam
 to re-inforce their Fleet: 
Opdam
 arrived in the 
Sound,
 but finding himself too weak to encounter the enemy; was forced to secure himself and Fleet in 
Copenhagen,
 then blockt up by the 
Swedes
 with a strait Siege, both by Sea and land: The King of 
Swedland
 in the mean time hear∣ing of greater preparations in 
Holland
 for a stronger Fleet to be sent under the command of 
De Ruyter,
 whose conduct and fortune was more apprehended then that of the others, ordered his Ministers in 
England
 vigorous∣ly to prosecute with the Usur∣per 
Oliver,
 their instances for as∣sistance: This they so accomplish∣ed, that the intended succours (his death preventing) were by him recommended to the care of his Son 
Richard,
 the short Successour to his Usurped autho∣rity: 
Richard
 with the consent

of the then pretended Parliament, for that end, and for the security of the English Trade in the 
Bal∣tick,
 in the beginning of the year 1659. sent the brave General 
Mon∣tague,
 afterward Earl of 
Sandwich,
 with fourty Men of Warr well mann'd, and some Fire-ships, who on the twenty seventh of 
April,
 arrived in the 
Sound:
 Shortly af∣ter came also 
De Ruyter
 with a strong Fleet from 
Holland,
 whose presence relieved 
Copenhagen
 and 
Opdams
 Fleet; For the 
Swedes
 not being able alone to come to a try∣all, the English refusing to fight until they were satisfied in some demands, and the news of the al∣teration of Government in 
Eng∣land (Richard
 the Protector being turned out of power) superve∣ning at the same instant, which called them home again, relieved the Besieged, and hindred a new rupture betwixt the 
English
 and the 
Dutch,
 which in all probabi∣lity

must have immediately en∣sued.


The King of 
Denmark
 by this timely succour revived, and the English Fleet returned to 
England,
 and 
Opdam
 to 
Holland; De Ruyter
 with the 
Dutch
 and 
Danish
 Fleet continued Master of the Seas, ready for some Land-undertaking, since the 
Swedes
 (then too weak) declined all engaging at Sea: The Island of 
Funnen
 in the 
Baltick Sea,
 of the ancient inheritance of the 
Danes,
 but then in the possession of the 
Swedes,
 being taken by them some years before, offered a neces∣sary occasion: And for that pur∣pose General 
Schaack,
 with seven thousand men, being put aboard of the Fleet at 
Kiel,
 were by 
De Ruyter
 conducted; and on the last of 
October
 landed at 
Kortemundor,
 in the Island of 
Funnen:
 The 
Swedes
 made brave resistance; but 
De Ruyter
 diverting their Forces, with alarming at the same time

other parts of the Island, and with a stout example, he him∣self standing in the water, encou∣raging the Souldiers to land, whom in great numbers they poured ashoar; The 
Swedes
 were overthrown with great losse, and the Island regained to the 
Danes.


This brave action of 
De Ruyter
 gained him more reputation from his Countrey, and honour from his masters, then all which be∣fore that time he had atchieved, and so endeared him to the fa∣vour and esteem of the King of 
Denmark,
 that he honoured him with the highest Order of Knight∣hood of that Kingdom, being that of the Elephant; and presented him with a Chain and Meddal of Gold, which afterward he wore; and having remained there among the 
Swedes,
 untill the Peace between the 
Danes
 and them in 
May.
 1660. was ratified,

he with great applause returned with his Fleet home.


The War betwixt the 
Danes
 and 
Swedes
 ended, and 
De Ruy∣ter
 with his Fleet safely returned into 
Holland,
 new losses from the Pirates of 
Argiers, Tripoli,
 and 
Tunis,
 called afresh to the States for remedy: The vigilant and successful 
De Ruyter
 was by the States designed for that charge; whose good services (on the like occasion) even in the infan∣cy of his Sea-command had been remarkable in those Seas; and is therefore dispatcht with a Squadron of Ships into the 
Streights;
 where he kept rang∣ing with his Fleet, pursuing and pressing those 
Gorsairs
 with so great care and success, that the benefit of his constant pains and valour became sensible to all the Merchants who traded there; whereby he confirmed to himself that fame and reputation which

he had heretofore so justly meri∣ted, until matters of greater con∣cern called him thence, upon the occasion following.


After the wonderfull and long-wished-for re-establishment of his Majesty, the King of 
Great Brittain,
 in the Throne of his Ancestors, from which by the madness of his Subjects he had been long banished; the States of the United Provinces overgrown with the wealth and prosperity of many years peace, the ordinary promoters of am∣bition; being conscious to them∣selves, that their carriage to∣wards their Neighbors, especi∣ally the English, however cloak∣ed, could not but breed such jealousies as must in time break forth into open enmity; and perceiving his Majesty of 
Great Brittain
 already so dissatisfied with their disguised practises, as could not but of necessty produce

a War, resolved to bring it to a tryall as soon as possibly they could, by giving the first occasi∣on of rupture, under the pretext of being provok'd by injuries re∣ceived upon the Coast of 
Guiny,
 and elsewhere; Hereupon they Ordered Admiral 
De Ruyter
 with a squardron of thirteen Men of War then at 
Gibraltor
 in 
Spain,
 to make sail for the Coast of 
Gui∣ny,
 and to set upon the English there; This he so effectually per∣formed, that in a short time he destroyed most of their Factories, took 
Cormanteen
 Castle with other places, severall Ships and goods belonging to the English.


That action so incensed his Ma∣jesty of 
Great Britain,
 that war was thereupon in 
anno
 1664. publick∣ly proclaimed against the States General of the United Provinces, impowering all his Majesties Sub∣jects, to use against them their subjects and people, all acts of

hostility; but whilst this was do∣ing at home, 
De Ruyter
 diligent in the pursuance of his Com∣mission abroad, attempted the burning of the English Ships at 
Barbadoes,
 but in vain; and from thence sailing to 
New-found land,
 took several Merchants Ships, stript the men, and left them without provisions; an act un∣worthy the name of so brave a man: Thus whilst 
Opdam
 Ad∣mirall of the Dutch Fleet in 
June
 1665, having engaged his Royall Highness the Duke of 
York,
 was in fire and smoak hurried out of this world, and his Fleet beat home with great loss of Ships and men; 
De Ray∣ter
 remained at Sea, annoying the Ships and Foreign Plantati∣ons of the English: But 
Opdams
 death rendred his presence at home absolutely necessary, his experience and success in War being so well known to all, that

the universal voice of the peo∣ple daily called his Name, whom (according to the interest and power they pretend to upon the Seas) they adopted, and inti∣tled, 
Son of Neptune:
 Advice was therefore sent to him, that he should with his Fleet hasten home with all expedition; which he obeying, slily slipt by the English Fleet wrapt in mist, as men with their cloaks about their mouths shun the company of those whom they are not willing to meet; And on the last of 
July
 1665. safely arrived in the 
Emmes:
 his arrival was congratulated by the States, and he thereupon made Admiral, but with authority not so abso∣lute, but that he was subordi∣nate to the Triumvirate of 
De Witt, Huygens
 and 
Bureel;
 who according to a new Model, had the superintendency of the Na∣vall affairs. He was no sooner

installed in his new Command, but 
August
 13. with a Fleet of Ninety Sail of Men of War, he was Ordered out from the 
Texel,
 to secure and convoy home the 
East-India
 Fleet, and many other rich Merchant-men, which stopt at 
Bergen
 for fear of the English Fleet then at Sea under the Command of the Earl of 
Sand∣wich;
 and who had been put in great alarm by the brave, but fruitless attempt of Sir 
Tho∣mas Tiddyman,
 who was sent out to have seized them in their harbour; In his going he met not with the English Fleet, but in his return was discovered and attacqued by the Earl of 
Sand∣wich,
 who finding himself too weak, his charge great, and the windes very high, with a run∣ning Fight he made the best of his way, and with the loss of two great 
East-India
 Ships, some other Merchant-men, and five

Men of War, he brought his Fleet into the West 
Emmes.


Before his Arrival by a Ma∣ster of a Ship which he had met at Sea, he sent a challenge to Major 
Holmes
 to meet him there; that seeing they two had been the first Adventurers in the War, they might try the success of the publick quarrel, as far as their particular prowess and fortune could incline it: The Challenge was as nobly ac∣cepted by the Major, as ge∣nerously and gallantly sent by 
De Ruyter;
 and the King of 
England
 to encourage the under∣taking, Knighted Major 
Holmes,
 and assigned him a stately New Ship then built at 
Deptford
 which he purposely called the 
Defiance:
 but this combat was diverted by other intervening accidents.


In 
May
 1666. 
De Ruyter
 with his Fleet being at Sea, His Ma∣jesty of 
Great Britain
 set out a

well appointed and great Fleet, under the joint Command of his Highness Prince 
Rupert,
 and his Grace the Duke of 
Albe∣marle,
 renowned for his valour and success in the former War against the Dutch, and now advanced to that title; for the great and memorable Services performed to the King: but a false rumour of the French be∣ing at Sea, occasioned the divi∣ding of that Fleet: for Prince 
Rupert
 with the white Squa∣dron, being ordered to make for the coast of 
France,
 to hin∣der the conjunction of the 
French
 and 
Dutch,
 who before the French came to Sea, the Duke of 
Albemarle
 was left, with about fifty Sail of Men of War, to wait on the Dutch: The boundless courage of that Duke, a dispiser of danger, led him to a gallant, but rash attempt, upon 
De Ruyter
 and his Fleet,

who then riding at anchor off of 
Dunkirk,
 with a number of Ships far exceeding the English; was upon Fryday the first of 
June
 so unexpectedly assaulted by them, the winde blowing high; that many of his Ships were fain to cut their cables in haste to put themselves in order of fighting: This was indeed a bloody and terrible engage∣ment, which continued with matchless fury and resolution on both sides, till Sunday in the Evening; when the English Fleet being much torn, and the Generals own Ship disabled; (the disproportion of number, and the enemies Fleet being to the Leeward, whereby they played their great guns, which the English could not, being to the weather, and the winde high; giving great advantage to the Dutch) they drew off, having lost the evening, before

the brave Ship the 
Prince,
 which being stranded, was burnt by the 
Dutch,
 and Sir 
George Ayscue
 Commander made Prisoner: yet notwithstanding their great loss, Prince 
Rupert
 upon notice given, and the noise of the guns then heard, having on Sunday in the Evening rejoyned the Fleet, and given the usuall proofs of his great and undaunted valour: both Generalls on Munday early in the morning, pursued the Dutch, who were almost out of sight, passed and repassed their Fleet several times: But 
De Ruy∣ter
 finding himself (notwithstan∣ding of the recruits received) so weakned, that his longer continuance in action might have produced the effects rather of a vain glorious Bravo, then of a prudent circumspect General, and good Countrey-man; ha∣ving given wonderfull marks of his carriage and conduct, made

made what haste he could to se∣cure his Fleet: This was the first encounter that 
De Ruyter
 as Com∣mander in chief had with the English in these Wars; the vic∣tory of which was equally cele∣brated in both Nations, but who∣ever had the better, it is certain, both sustained very great losses.


The pretensions to victory in this last Fngagement owned mu∣tually by both parties, occasioned their hastening out again with all speed to Sea, either to make good the old, or to gain a new title; and so in 
Iuly
 both Fleets were abroad; The 
English
 commanded by 
Albemarle,
 and the 
Dutch
 by 
De Ruyter;
 And on S. 
Iames's
 day about nine in the morning met and fell to blows again. 
De Ruy∣ter
 with his Fleet for some con∣siderable time made a brisk and a stout resistance, but the English jealous of their honour which seemed to suffer by the 
Dutch
 ar∣rogating

to themselves the Victo∣ry in the former Engagement, plyed them so fiercely, that pro∣vident 
De Ruyter
 finding his fleet in a bad condition, according to his saving principles, of making the best of an ill bargain, began to give way, and was so closely pursued by the 
English
 Red and White Squadrons (whilest 
Van Trump
 couragiously entertained the Blew) that 
De Ruyters
 own Ship was much shattered, and himself in all probability, if the English great ships could have got up with him, in danger of being taken, and two squadrons of his Fleet utterly destroyed: In this fight, on the 
English
 side, were only three Captains killed, the 
Resolution
 burnt, and not ma∣ny above three hundred men kil∣led and wounded: On the 
Dutch
 side (according to the general computation of that time) above four thousand men killed, three

hundred common Sea-men wounded, and many Captains slain, amongst which 
Everson
 Admiral of 
Zeland, Dirickhids
 Ad∣miral of 
Friesland,
 the Vice-Ad∣miral of 
Friesland,
 and Rear-Ad∣miral 
Van Saen,
 and the number of their fleet so impaired, that of above an hundred Ships there re∣turned but eighty into harbour. The 
Dutch
 who hitherto still boast∣ed of Victory, gave now sensible signs of the English having the better, by leaving their harbours and rodes undefended; so that Sir 
Robert Holmes
 shortly after this fight, sails into the 
Ulie,
 and with one fifth-rate Frigate, some Ketch∣es and fireships, there burnt an hundred and sixty sail of 
Dutch
 Vessels.


But neither was this nor the last blow so fatall as to keep the 
Dutch
 from Sea, for about the end of 
August
 Admiral 
De Ruyter
 ap∣pears again with a stronger fleet

then before, stretching along the back of the 
Goodwin
 sands, for the 
French
-coast, with designe to have joyned the Duke of 
Beaufort,
 who with about forty sail of 
French
 ships lay at 
Rochel
 ready to come to their assistance: The English fleet having advice, made after them with such diligence, that they were forced to stand in for 
Bulloign
-road, and there very nar∣rowly escaped a new Engagement, by reason of the weather, which growing extremely tempestuous, constrained the English to bear away for 
S. Hellens Bay,
 the place of rendevouz, and the most pro∣per station to hinder the conjun∣ction of the 
French
 and 
Dutch:
 In the mean while the 
Ruby
 a 
French
-ship of fifty four guns, com∣manded by 
Monsieur le Roche
 se∣parated by foul weather from the rest of the fleet, mistaking the enemies white-flag for their own, fell in amongst the English, and

after some stout resistance, was taken, and the Captain made Pri∣soner, but in complement to his valour, was afterward dismissed: And now 
De Ruyter
 falling sick, was forced to return to 
Amster∣dam,
 leaving the care and charge of the 
Dutch
 fleet to 
Van Ness;
 But the States finding the season far spent, and the weather stormy and tempestuous, commanded their fleet home.


After that the 
Dutch
 Fleet was returned into harbour, and 
De Ruyter
 recovered of his sickness, some grudgings and animosities arisen betwixt him and 
Van Trump
 during the late actions, pro∣ceeding partly (as it was concei∣ved) from the byass of their differ∣ing factions, the former being a de∣clared re-publican, and the latter a favourer of the interest of the Prince of 
Orange,
 who was not then advanced to the dignity of Stat-holder;) broke forth in∣to

such open debate, that they mutually accused and blamed each other, for the ill success and miscarriages of the past Summers actions; but Admiral 
De Ruyter
 highly esteemed by the States for his Valour, prudence and fingular conduct, and sup∣ported by the favour of the lea∣ding Party, so far prevailed with his Masters, that several Sea-Commanders were put to death for cowardise, and himself con∣firmed with greater power and authority then before.


About the end of this year 1666. the Dutch being weary of the vast expences, and weakned by the great losses of the war, and the English much disheart∣ned by the burning of the City of 
London,
 which happened in 
September;
 both seemed inclina∣nable to an accomodation; and overtures of peace thereupon be∣gan to be set on foot on either

side; which seemed to some who thought themselves wise very hopeful.


In the beginning of the Spring 
De Ruyter
 was again speeded out to Sea, and in 
April
 1667, made an attempt with a good Fleet upon Brunt-Island, a Town in the Scottish firth, intending to have landed and spoyled the Countrey; but by the vigilant care, and conduct of the Earl of 
Rothoes,
 Chancellour of that Kingdom, with the Trained Bands of the Countrey, he was bravely repulsed with loss.


After this, 
De Ruyter
 to amuse the English (who in a small Fleet were at sea) sent off a detach∣ment of twenty five sail of ships to cruise to the Northward, who on the third of 
June
 falling in with Nineteen Sail of English Frigats off of 
Hull,
 began a furi∣ous and bloudy conflict, which was so stoutly and obstinately

maintained on both sides, that from twenty five the 
Dutch
 were reduc't to fourteen sail, and the 
English
 from nineteen to fifteen.


Shortly after he made an at∣tempt upon some Neighbouring parts of 
Harwich,
 having put a∣shoar three thousand men near 
Felston-cliff,
 and commanded two thousand of them to make an as∣sault upon 
Langward-Fort,
 which was twice essayed, the first last∣ing about three quarters of an hour, and the other one quarter; but at last with the losse of an hun∣dred men, they were forced to retreat in so much haste and dis∣order, that they left behinde them all their ladders: whilest these a∣ctions continued at 
Langward-fort,
 a party of twelve hundred 
Dutch
 being posted at the cliff their lan∣ding-place, to secure and make good their retreat, were attack∣ed by the Trained Bands of the Countrey under the Command of

the Earl of 
Suffolk,
 and the 
Dutch
 being supplied with fresh recruits from the Fleet, a very smart skir∣mish continued betwixt them till ten of the night; but the 
English
 horse then coming in sight, the 
Dutch
 thought it safest to quit the Land, and so as soon as their boats were afloat, in great haste they embarqued, and returned to their Fleet.


The day following this defeat at 
Langward-Fort, de Ruyter
 with the 
Dutch
 Fleet was pursued by Sir 
Edward Spragg
 and Sir 
Joseph Jordan
 with about twenty sail of small Frigats; but whether 
De Ruyter
 finding his Orders limited, or for the reasons above-hinted, notwithstanding he had a much stronger Fleet, kept at distance, and carefully avoided engage∣ment; taking his course through the channell for the Western parts of 
England:
 In his passage he ap∣peared before 
Portsmouth,
 but

knowing the strength of the place, and finding the Countrey in arms, he only shewed himself there, and so continued his voyage to the Western coasts.


In 
Devonshire
 he endeavoured to have landed some men at 
Wen∣bury,
 but the Militia of the Coun∣trey being ready to receive them, so warmly saluted them with some Volleys of small shot, that they were forced with all speed to betake themselves back again to their ships. The Admiral de∣spairing to effect any thing here by force, sent off a boat with a white flag, desiring leave to come ashoar to buy fresh provisions, but it was denied him by the Gen∣tlemen and Officers that com∣manded there; alledging that no such permission could be granted without the consent and autho∣rity of the Commander in chief, who then was absent: 
De Ruyter
 in this manner disappointed of

his intent at 
Wenbury,
 came with his whole Fleet before 
Couland
 in 
Cornwall,
 and having anchored within musket shot of the shoar; sent off twelve boats full of men with designe of landing, whilst he in the mean time played on the land with his great guns from aboard: but the Foot of the Countrey, that were posted there, purposely to oppose their lan∣ding, charged them so briskly, that they were forced to put off again without effecting an
 thing.


By this time 
De Ruyter
 being informed from 
Holland
 of the progress of the Treaty of Peace, which now was in a tendency to a speedy conclusion, not willing with new hostilities to retard that which was so heartily desired by both parties; relented a little in the ardour of his proceedings, and began to heal the wounds which he had formerly made, by

prudent application of the poli∣tick plaisters of necessity and ig∣norance; excusing some hostili∣ties, as thereto enjoyned by his Commission, and others as com∣mitted without his Order: And to that purpose sent off two of∣ficers with a flag of truce, who being brought before Sir 
Jonathan Trelawny,
 who commanded in chief under the Earl of 
Bath
 in these parts, and having made the complement and apologies of the 
dmiral, desired in his name a conference with some English aboard, for whose safe coming and returning, he was ready to engage the faith of the Seven Provinces. Sir 
Jonathan
 having herewith advised the Earl of 
Bath,
 by his Order 
De Ruyter
 was visited aboard of his own Ship, by the same Sir 
Jonathan Trelawny,
 Major 
Sparks,
 and Mr. 
Windham.
 The Admiral upon their approach courteously came

over his Ships-side, met, and re∣ceived them in their boat, where after mutuall salutations, having renewed the Apologies formerly made by his messengers; he in∣vited them aboard, received them with a salute of Ordinance, and entertained them with the Chief Officers of his Fleet at a mag∣nificent dinner in the great Cabbin: During which he gave honourable demonstrations of love and esteem for their per∣sons, and frequently repeated the expressions of the great ho∣nour he had for his Majesty and Kingdom of 
England;
 and real and hearty wishes for a solid and permanent correspondence be∣twixt both Nations, lamenting the great damages and loss which acorued to both by so ruinating a War. The English entertained his civilities with reciprocal returns of honour and kindeness, and having offered

him supplies of all necessary pro∣visions for his own Table, refu∣sing more untill the peace should be concluded; they took their leave, having been first assured by him, that no more hurt should be done to the Countrey whilst he remained on these Coasts. The Earl of 
Bath
 after∣ward presented him with such provisions and necessaries, as the Countrey and season of the year afforded; which he courteously received, and in signe of grati∣tude fired several guns, and so departed: but notwithstanding the promises of indemnity gi∣ven, after his departure from 
Plymouth,
 two of his Fleet, ad∣vancing toward 
Foy,
 for some time lay annoying and battering the harbour and shoar with great shot, till having received dammage in their hulls, and one of them having lost his main topmast, they desisted and went

off; whether this was by the Generals Order or not, is not known; there having been no enquiry ever made in the action, by reason of the peace that im∣mediatly followed; but it is be∣lieved that 
De Ruyter
 had no hand in it.


This long expected Peace con∣cluded at 
Breda
 the 21 of 
June,
 and at length the 14th of 
August
 1667. ratified in 
England,
 rather by the exigency and necessity of the times, than the intire and full satisfaction of both parties, as appeared within few years af∣terward, gave respite to both Nations to breathe a little, and recruit their mutual past losses by industrious prosecuting their traffick, the hugg'd darling of both people: and to consider in cold blood what had been done amisse by either side, during the War, that from so seasonable a peace, they might pick the ne∣cessary

means of future reparati∣on. And now 
De Ruyter
 having safely reconducted his Fleet into harbour, was received by the States with thanks and honours suitable to his merit, and with the universal acclamations and applause of the Countrey; and was judged by all discreet men to have understood as well the measures of a General in that Common-wealth as any who∣soever, by his never giving way to the transports of vain∣glory, or rage in the heat of action, but by timely retreat or advantagious fighting; like the Roman 
Fabius Maximus, Cunctan∣do restituit rem.


The States having now no more need of so eminent a Com∣mander at sea, the great and dreadfull War being over, but occasion still of a wise and pra∣ctised Statesman at home; ad∣mitted the 
Heer De Ruyter
 with

no less expectation into their Councils of difficult affairs, then they had formerly impowred him as General at sea: wherein he so answered their hopes; that during the four years peace, or rather cessation of arms betwixt 
England
 and 
Holland,
 he gave so signal proofs of his prudence, that they were only fain to dis∣pence with his being at home; because they could not finde a Successour for him abroad which the businesse of the year 1672. ur∣gently required.


The 
French
 King in 
anno
 1671. with a considerable army came to 
Dunkirk
 in 
Flanders,
 this progresse in a time of peace being accom∣panied with great preparations for War, gave apprehensions to all his Neighbours, but especial∣ly to the States of the United Provinces, who suspecting that his approach so near them, was to shew them the rod with

which he intended to chastise the rudeness and insolency which the States were said to have used towards his Majesty; began to arm, and make ready for their own defence. The King of 
Great Britain,
 likewise seeing his po∣tent and most dangerous compe∣titors so busy and earnest at work, the designe of which was not as yet made publick; thought it time to look to the security of his subjects, and to put his Kingdoms out of danger of a surprise: and so at the same time (as by an influence of de∣stiny) most States of Christen∣dome seemed to prepare for war. The 
French
 who pretended to teach civility and good manners to those, who oftentimes are not willing to learn; thought the 
Dutch
 stood in need of some do∣cuments; and the partial and slow performances made by the States to the King of 
England,


and his subjects, of the Articles of their last Peace, and the quar∣rel of the 
Dutch
 fishing, ancient∣ly in the English seas, and more lately in their rivers, being neither so well adjusted, nor digested, as might stand with the honour and security of pub∣lick interest; the King herewith provoked, and by reviling Pamphlets against his Royal Person, joyned with the 
French
 King in a strict League of pur∣suing by arms their mutual pre∣tentions against the 
Dutch:
 And having first friendly demanded satisfaction of the past abuses by his Embassadour Sir 
George Down∣ing,
 his Majesty resolved to sum∣mon them to their duty by a more effectual Method.


On the thirteenth of 
January,
 two parties meeting, and the Dutch refusing to strike, there followed an engagement, and this first blow being thus given,

the King of Great Brittain pub∣lisheth his Declaration against the States of the United Pro∣vinces to this effect; That the dissatisfaction which his Majesty had from the carriage of the States General of the United Pro∣vinces towards him, for some years past, being such, that he could no longer without diminu∣tion of his own honour, dissem∣ble the indignation raised in him by a treatment too unsuitable to the great obligations which he and his Predecessours had so li∣berally heaped upon them; He was resolved to declare war a∣gainst them, forbidding all his Subjects to hold correspondence with them upon pain of death. This Declaration being with the usuall solemnities proclaimed in 
London
 and 
Westminster,
 was se∣conded by the French King with actions previous to a rupture with that Crown also: he ha∣ving

laid great taxes and cu∣stomes upon all Dutch goods in his kingdom, and raised an im∣position of fifty 
per cent.
 upon salt, and other merchandises of 
France
 exported by the 
Dutch,
 and up∣on all herrings, spices, and o∣ther goods imported into his do∣minions by them: prohibiting all his subjects to lade any bran∣dy aboard of any 
Holland
 or 
Dutch
 Vessells, and shortly after publickly, and in good earnest declared war.


The States of 
Holland
 foresee∣ing the storm which now began to break upon them, had so for∣tified themselves with the pow∣erfull alliances of 
Spain, Germany,
 and 
Denmark,
 that they seemed not unequally matched with their mighty enemies in so great a conjunction: so that in the year 1672. the greatest part of the States of Christendome be∣came involved in a bloody and

expensive War, which is not yet ended.


Matters thus advancing to∣ward action, the Dutch who were not behinde in their pre∣parations, but wanting a head, resolved to gratifie both Kings in the choice of their General, and so in a full Assembly of the States, the 
Prince of Orange
 is una∣nimously elected 
Generallissimo
 of all their Forces both by Sea and Land, for that years expedition, with promise to renew his au∣thority after expiration, during life: and 
Jan De Wit
 and the 
Rereward van Putten
 (the two unfortunate brothers that were afterward barbarously murthered in a tumult of the incensed rab∣ble at the 
Hague
) with some others, appointed as Commissi∣oners to assist him: Under him 
De Ruyter
 was made Lieutenant-Admiral, whose power (not∣withstanding of his many tried

services, such is the fear of that State of an absolute authority) was stinted, having the 
Rereward Van Putten
 placed over him by the States as a check and curb: and considering the foreward∣ness of the English in their pre∣parations, was ordered with all expedition to hasten with his Fleet to Sea.


His Royall Highness the 
Duke of York,
 whose former success a∣gainst the Dutch had rendred his very name more terrible to that people, than the wonders of others, being at Sea with the English Fleet commanded by himself in chief, and the Earl of 
Sandwich
 Admiral of the Blew; and having joyned the 
French
 with the white flag under the Command of the Count 
d'Estree,
 which all together made a for∣midable Navy, of about an hun∣dred and sixty sail, great and small: In 
May
 1672. made to∣ward

the Coast of 
Holland,
 in search of the 
Dutch
 Fleet, then likewise at Sea, Commanded by 
De Ruyter, Van Ghent
 and 
Banckert;
 and having had seve∣ral views of the enemy, but no opportunity of fighting, which the cautious 
De Ruyter
 always a∣voided, according to his politick 
Maximes,
 without some appa∣rent advantage; but more espe∣cially at this juncture, when the States had so much lying at stake, not thinking it safe to quit his sands: his Highness with the whole Fleet returned to the Coast of 
England,
 and came to anchor in 
Southwold Bay.


De Ruyter
 (in the mean while) who was seldome out in his con∣jectures, concluding that his de∣clining of an Engagement would certainly be by the 
English
 and 
French
 interpreted fear, and con∣sequently breed in them con∣tempt of their enemy, and there∣by

security, resolved to come up with them before he was ex∣pected: and being by his scouts advertised in what posture the English fleet lay, and having the winde favourable at E. N. E. weighed anchor from behinde his banks with his whole Fleet and on 
May
 29th. by five of the clock in the morning came in sight of the Royall Fleet, so un∣expected, that several Ships were forced to cut their cables in dis∣order, to put themselves in po∣sture of fighting, and about eight in the morning fell in with them. The fight began be∣twixt the Earl of 
Sandwich
 in the 
Royall James
 with the blew Squadron, and 
Van Ghent,
 whilst his Royall Highness in the 
Prince
 with the Red, engaged 
De Ruyter,
 and the Count 
De Estree
 with the French, and white Squadron, 
Banckert.
 The fight was terrible and bloody, especially between

the blew Squadron and 
Van Ghent,
 who in the beginning of the battel was shot to death. The brave Earl of 
Sandwich
 who was resolved to pawn his life for his honour, being engaged in the middle of the 
Dutch
 with a few ships; the 
Soveraign,
 and others of his Squadron, having stood off to gain the weather-gage, and the Duke in hot action with 
De Ruyter,
 overpowerd with a number of men of War and fire∣ships, and a hardy Dutch Cap∣tain 
Adrian Brackell,
 having laid him aboard athwart the hass; yet still continued the fight with such unshaken courage, that he sunk two of three of the fire∣ships that had grapled with him, and forced the Dutch Captain to call for quarter: but at last his ship being unhappily fired by a third Fireship, was burnt, and he himself with many persons of quality bravely, but unfortu∣nately

perished; to the grief of the King his Master, and un∣speakable regret of his Coun∣trey; having left to posterity an immortal proof, that Valour crowned with honour, does not shrink, but swells by its reward. 
Haddock
 his Captain though wounded, escaped by swimming, till he was taken up. This hap∣pened in the afternoon, when those ships of the blew-squa∣dron, that had stood off, having got the winde, bore down upon the Dutch, and assisted the Duke who pressed 
De Ruyter
 so straitly, that towards the even∣ing he gave way, and stood o∣ver for the Dutch Coast, and was pursued by the Duke all night. In this Engagement be∣sides the losse of the Noble Earl of 
Sandwich,
 and his ship, the 
Henry
 and 
Royall Catherine,
 two great ships on the English side were taken, Captain 
Dighy


Commander of the first being killed, and Sir 
John Chichely
 of the latter made prisoner, but were both shortly after regained by the English prisoners aboard, who forced and overcome their guards. On the Dutch side, Ad∣miral 
Van Ghent
 was slain, most of their great ships miserably torn, and two of them sunk, and one of fourty eight guns Captain 
Elderson
 of 
Amsterdam
 Commander taken, many more were missing, of which no parti∣cular account can be given. The 
Dutch
 with confidence pleased themselves to brag of a Victory with the accustomed solemnities of rejoycing; and imputed much of the English loss to the French seperating from the rest of the Fleet that day, about noon; but it is certain that the Duke ha∣ving pursued them to their own Coast, and having next day in vain offered battel, kept the

seas, and could bring them to no more action this year.


The advice of the prevailing progress of the 
French
 on the one hand, and the Bishop of 
Munster
 on the other, which put the States in much apprehension, and the people in great fright and confusion; being brought to 
De Ruyter,
 as he rode with his Fleet at the Oyster-bank; oc∣casioned his hastening from thence to 
Blanckenburgh,
 there to put ashoar a great part of his men to be employed at land, where the danger then seemed most pressing: And whilst he continued there with a Fleet half mann'd to secure the arri∣val of the 
East-India
 Fleet, which was then look't for; the 
Duke of York
 kept at sea, sometime cruising, sometime at anchor on the 
Doggerbank,
 in very bad weather, with intention either to seize that Fleet, or to pro∣voke

voke the Dutch to a New En∣gagement by their attempting to defend them. About this time the tumult of the untractable people who imputed all their ca∣lamities to the errours of their Governours, grew every where so high, that it seemed to threa∣ten a dissolution of Government; especially at 
Dort,
 where the 
Burghers
 armed in a great body having surrounded the house where the 
Prince of Orange
 sate at dinner, with the Magistrates of the place; sent some of their Officers with a form of writing, containing a New Election of his Highnesse to be hereditary Stat∣holder of the Common-wealth, with a renunciation of all mali∣cious Acts and Edicts made by the 
Lovestein
 faction to the con∣trary; threatning the Magistrates with the losse of their lives, un∣lesse they presently signed it: This peremptory desire the Magistrates

durst not refuse, but presently signed the Writing, and dispen∣ced with the Oath formerly ex∣torted from the Prince, never to accept any such dignity for the future by the contrary and sway∣ing party: and this tumultuary procedure had the influence up∣on the other Corporations, that most did the like; so that at length it advanced so far as to be publickly ratified and confir∣med by the States; so great or∣der many times by a guiding providence is produced from greatest confusion.


In the rage of this unruly multitude 
De Ruyter
 himself there celebrated tutelary and guardian, though then at sea, for their de∣fence hardly escaped their fury; for a company of common peo∣ple having mutined into a body beset his house in the New Island of 
Amsterdam;
 and if they had not been hindred by the Magi∣strates

had plundered and sackt it: this was so strange when no previous set discourse (that is known) did winde up the Jack to such a revolution; that it af∣fords us another easy and obvi∣ous remark, that men when they are mad, are never wise.


The Duke of 
York
 having for many weeks kept his station, and suffered very foul weather on the 
Dogger-bank;
 and 
De Ruyter
 at 
Blanckenburgh,
 without any of∣fer of fighting; the long wished for 
East-India
 Fleet (which the Duke hoped might give occasion to a new tryal) at length ap∣peared near the Coast of 
Holland. De Ruyter
 by his advice-boats in∣formed of this, thinking him∣self obliged to use his utmost en∣deavours, for the security of so great a concern: weighed from 
Blanckenburgh,
 and with a Fleet ill-mann'd, and in bad conditi∣on of fighting; slid along the

shoar, without being discovered by the English; met the Fleet, and safely conducted them into 
Delfzey
 in the 
West-Emms.
 The 
Cambridge
 and 
Bristol
 two Eng∣lish Frigats, being then upon the scout, came up with them, and had some little encounter; but the windes was high, and the sea so rough, that no booty could be gained. The Duke having now lost all hopes of alluring the 
Dutch
 to any more action this year, left Sir 
Edward Spragg
 with a squa∣dron of ships to keep the seas, and disturb their fishing, and he him∣self with the rest of the fleet re∣turned home.


The torrent of the French con∣quests at land being now some∣what stopt, and the tumult and, rage of the people quieted, the affairs of Sea came next in play; In the preparations for which, the vigilant 
De-Ruyter
 with much diligence employed the winter

(which happened by reason of its openness, to be very favourable to the 
Dutch
) proposing to him∣self reasonable advantages, if he could have a Fleet in readiness next spring at Sea, before the coming of the 
French,
 which he effected. For in 
May
 1673. with a strong and well-appointed Na∣vy commanded by himself, 
Van Trump
 and 
Banckert,
 he was out again at Sea, and in the mouth of the River of 
Thames,
 with de∣signe, by sinking of several great Ships in the narrow passages of the Channel, called the 
Middle∣ground,
 to have stopped and blockt up the mouth and entry of the river; but the breadth of that channel, and the commodiousness of others, rendred his attempts al∣together in vain.


Prince 
Rupert,
 who for this Years Expedition Commanded the Royal Navies, lying at the 
Buoy of the Nore,
 with part

of the 
English
 fleet (the 
French
 being not as yet arrived) when 
De Ruyter
 appeared, was hindred by the windes to get out; but afterwards having with much dif∣ficulty put to Sea, and made to∣wards the 
Dutch: De Ruyter
 not swerving from his former mea∣sures, thinking he gained enough when he did not lose, warily re∣tired behinde the banks, those impregnable sea-ramparts, shun∣ning at that time any engagement: The Prince seeing this, stood with his fleet for the 
Streights
 off 
Calais,
 with intention to meet the 
French
 and 
Portsmouth
 fleets; whom af∣ter a short stay, he having joyned at 
Dungean ness,
 with the whole fleet, returned for the coast of 
Holland,
 and 
May
 26. 1673. arrived before 
Schonvelt
 where 
de Ruyter
 lay with his fleet.


The winde and Sea then unsea∣sonable, allowed no fair opportu∣nity of fighting, but the twenty

eighth in the morning, the wea∣ther fair, and a fresh gale, invi∣ted the Prince to action: 
De Ruy∣ter
 still kept his station where the great ships could not approach: and the Prince resolving by all means possible to draw him to an engagement, sent off thirty five sail of small Frigats to provoke him to battel: The 
Dutch
 con∣trary to the expectation of the 
English
 and 
French
 in excellent order came forth, and boldly en∣countred this Van-guard of the fleet with such hot service, that they being forced a little to yield, disordered the rest of the Royal Navy: The fight continued des∣perately on both sides, the 
English
 and 
French
 with mutuall emula∣tion behaving themselves brave∣ly, and with so much eagerness, that they entangled each other, and gave some advantage to the enemy: For the Valiant Earl of 
Ossory
 being pestered amongst the

French,
 ran foul of an 
English
 Fregat, and was entangled with a fireship; and was no sooner got clear, but the observant 
De Ruyter
 laying hold of the oppor∣tunity, bore down upon him with his whole Squadron, and gave him fresh occasion to signa∣lize his Valour: The Earl with his ships that were with him, received the Admirall with no less resolution then he was at∣tacqued, and maintained a bloudy fight, with equal success, till both being sufficiently battered, the night put an end to the con∣flict, and the 
Dutch
 returned to their lurking holes: In this Fight 
de Ruyter
 lost only the Ship called the 
Debenter,
 and had killed the Vice-Admsral 
Schram,
 Rear-Ad∣miral 
Ulugh,
 and six Captains: After the old manner both Par∣ties claimed the honour of the Victory; The 
Dutch
 because they had repulsed the Assailants, and

the English because they had for∣ced the 
Dutch
 to their banks of re∣fuge; but both fleets were much damnified.


The next three days were spent in mending and re-fitting their shattered ships, which the 
Dutch
 had better opportunity to perform (having all necessaries from their stores at hand) then the 
English,
 who were so remote from their own Coast; So that 
de Ruyter
 knowing well the advantage, in the begining of 
Iune
 put out again, and by his approach allarmed the 
English,
 who had not as yet got into such readiness; yet notwith∣standing they presently put them∣selves in a posture of engaging, observing the motion of the 
Dutch;
 which 
de Ruyter
 perceiving drew all his fleet into a line, reaching three leagues, and so came to an anchor, expecting the coming unto the fleet of the 
Heers Boscho∣velt, Van der Meyden, Moregnault,


and 
Van der Vierse
 the Deputies of the States General; who being arrived and in a Council of War having approved his intent of fighting, and afterward return∣ed again ashoar; on the fourth of 
June, De Ruyter
 with his whole Fleet, was by eleven of the clock again under sail, mak∣ing directly towards the Eng∣lish, who kept their old stati∣on. Sir 
Edward Spragg
 Admiral of the English blew squadron, who had the Van, not believing that the Dutch intended to fight, but only as before to change their rode; made no great haste to bear up, and so lost the winde; and being much pressed by the 
French,
 as they by the Prince in the rear, who were all ea∣ger to come to blows; he was put in some little disorder. The two Fleets for some time fought stoutly, especially where the Earl of 
Ossory
 and Sir 
Edward

Spragg
 engaged, till the Prince finding the disadvantage of the winde, with the red and white squadrons stood away 
N W. De Ruyter
 thinking it was to get the winde, which he was not wil∣ling to lose, did the like, and left 
Van Trump
 with the rest of the Fleet in a sharp conflict with 
Spragg
 and 
Ossory.
 The day began to close before the shot on either side betwixt the Prince and 
De Ruyter
 began to do exe∣cution: but at length the Eng∣lish must confess, that to their great wonder, they first learned here, that the 
Dutch
 powder was stronger and the guns longer than their own. So Prince 
Ru∣pert
 having shifted himself from the 
Royal Charles
 into the 
Old Soverain,
 and Sir 
Edward Spragg
 rejoyned the Fleet, they fought at distance most part of the night, and by break of day both Fleets being out of sight of each

other, the Prince with the loss of many men, and disabled ships, made for the 
Thames;
 and 
De Ruyter
 with little loss having had the advantage of the winde and a distant fight, stood back for his old station on the Coast of 
Zeland. De Ruyter
 in this acti∣on gave evident proof that he knew when it was time to pur∣sue as well as retreat, and that he never turned his back but with intent to shew his face.


It was now the twentieth of 
July
 before the 
English
 and 
French
 were in condition again to visit the 
Dutch
 Coasts, and then ha∣ving discovered 
De Ruyter
 with his Fleet eight leagues off of the Coast of 
Zealand,
 and in posture of Fighting, the Royall Navy expected an Engagement, but wise 
De Ruyter
 who always fought after his own manner, knew well the importance of so great a triall, and that the affairs

of his Countrey so embarrassed on all hands, did not require the hazarding of the interest and honour of his Masters, or of himself, without some probable hopes of saving of both; stood in nearer the shoar, and bore a∣way along the Coast, declining all engagement untill the one and twentieth of 
August
 follow∣ing.


On the twentieth of 
August,
 Prince 
Rupert
 being informed that the 
Dutch
 Fleet were about 
Goree,
 made thither, and towards the evening discovered them: but being then late, thought best not to attacque them that night: In the mean time 
De Ruyter
 according to his ordinary conduct improving the benefit of the darkness, stood in close to the shoar, and bearing up before next morning, gained the winde of the English, and by seven of the Clock bore down

upon them freshly. The 
Prince
 upon this, changing his course, stood away S. W. and the 
French
 who had the Van engaged 
Banckert,
 the Prince in the middle, 
De Ruyter
 and Sir 
Edward Spragg
 in the rear, (after the old manner) 
Van Trump.
 This Fight was so managed between the 
Eng∣lish
 and 
Dutch,
 as if both parties being by some secret instinct ac∣quainted that this was to be the last, resolved to prove their ut∣most and last effects of fortitude and conduct among the 
French,
 Capt. 
Martel
 behaved himself bravely: 
Banckert
 sent off a few ships to wait the 
French
 motion, and with the rest of his squa∣dron came in to the assistance of 
De Ruyter
 against the Prince, who for some time valiantly ex∣changed their broadsides, and behaved themselves with equal courage and success. Sir 
Edward Spragg
 and 
Van Trump
 (the two

declared Competitiours and Ri∣vals for honour) with their squa∣drons in the mean time persisted in action with such determinate resolution, that the 
Dutch
 avow the like never to have been seen, their own two ships having without touching of a sail strangely endured the fury of three full hours uncessant batte∣ry. But Sir 
Edward Spraggs
 Ship the 
Prince,
 having lost her masts, and being so fearfully torn, as to be unfit for more service, with his flag displayed in his boat, he shifted aboard off the 
St. George;
 and finding her like∣wise disabled, as he was leaving of her to get into the 
Royall Charles,
 a cruel shot funk his boat, and left him helpless in the Ocean, whose power being grea∣ter then that of 
Van Trump;
 by his death chill'd that heat of courage, which 
Trump
 could ne∣ver have cooled above water:

His death was by all, even the Dutch themselves bewailed, who acknowledged him to have been a brave man, and valiant Souldi∣er: His Ship couragiously defen∣ded by the stout Earl of 
Ossory
 (notwithstanding all the at∣tempts that 
Van Trump
 made to be Master of her.) was safely towed off by the 
Hampshire
 Fre∣gat. The Prince and 
de Ruyter
 at this time finding themselves at too great distance from the squadrons so hotly engaged, who stood both in need of as∣sistance; as by mutual consent, tacked both, and in friendly manner without firing, stood to∣wards their respective friends: but 
de Ruyter
 having joyned 
Van Trump
 who was still engaged, with the blew, before the Prince could could come in; fell upon the blew with renewed fury, intending to have totally out off that squadron from the rest of the

English Fleet; but at length the Prince coming in time, broke in amongst the Dutch with unan∣swerable force, and Captain 
Legg
 with his fireships, put them in great disorder and confusion; It was believed by all, that if the 
French
 had made their best use of that winde, 
de Ruyter
 and his Fleet could not so fairly (as they did) by the favour of the night, have taken their leave of this and all other publick action with the English, during this War. The losses in this last Fight were great on both sides; many brave Com∣manders, and Vast number of men killed and wounded; but both so positively pretending to victory, it is hard to determine who had the better; yet the Dutch by Sir 
Edward Spraggs
 death think∣ing their title good, made the whole Countrey so merry with the ringing noise of Victory: that the States changed the following

day of Humiliation into thanks∣giving, and in stead of fasting, drunk and sung Psalms.


The singular prudence and con∣duct of Admiral 
de Ruyter
 in the several passages of this War, ren∣dred him so useful to his Countrey (of whose tottering and decay∣ing state he seemed the 
Atlas
 and guardian) and so considerable to his enemies, who by experience found it not easy to triumph-over him; that notwithstanding the powerful efforts made for that end, the success of affairs remai∣ned so little inclined to either side, that the one had no reason to despair, nor the other to scorn the prossers of accommodation; made way for a Treaty of peace with 
England;
 and the States of 
Holland
 catching their opportuni∣ty, when the vigorous intercessi∣on of the Crown, and Ministers of 
Spain
 concurred so pat with the publick good offices of their

friends in 
England:
 they so ef∣fectually pursued the necessary and advantagious concern of peace with that kingdom, that by the frequent sollicitations and busy importunities of one and other, the King of 
Great Britain
 did at length condescend to a peace with the Dutch: which was concluded at 
West∣minster
 the Ninth of 
February,
 1674. to the unspeakable joy of the States, and perpetual renown of 
de Ruyter,
 in such a pinching nick of time, that the Dutch had good reason to be thankfull for so seasonable an accomoda∣tion.


Janus
 Temple being thus half shut, and the States General ha∣ving now but one way to look; resolved to bend all their forces against the 
French,
 both by Sea and land: and knowing that the 
French
 would not adventure to meet them at Sea; being dis∣joyned

from the English; judg∣ed it most convenient to molest their navigation, annoy their Coasts, and destroy (as much as conveniently could be done) their Countrey and Plantations. In Order hereunto, they sent out a great Fleet of sixty six men of War, besides victuallars, ten∣ders and fireships, under the Com∣mand of Lieutenant Admirall 
De Ruyter,
 and 
Van Trump,
 with a flying Army of Land-forces, Com∣manded by Count 
William Van Horn.
 This Fleet joyned at their rendevous on the fourteenth of 
May
 1674. set sail from the 
Weel∣ings;
 and having by a Squadron of fifteen men of War, allarmed all the Coast of 
Calais
 and 
Bulloigne,
 they passed along the English shoar, and 
Isle of Wight,
 and come to anchor in 
Tourbay.
 Here after a great Councill of War, they divided the Fleet into two Squadrons; appointing one and

twenty fail of Men of War, and fourty eight other Ships, with se∣veral Companies of Land-souldi∣ers, under the Command of Old 
De Ruyter
 Admiral, 
Evertse
 of 
Zealand
 Vice-Admiral, and young 
Engell de Ruyter
 Son of the other Rear-Admiral for the Western French Islands; and 
Van Trump
 and the Count 
Horn,
 with the rest of the fleet and Land-forces, for the Coast of 
France.


The designe so laid, was accord∣ingly put in execution; for 
De Ruyter
 with his fleet on the 29. of 
May
 made sail to the Westward, and ten days after 
Van Trump
 for the coast of 
France; de Ruyter
 conti∣nuing his course with fair windes, on the ninth of 
Iuly
 came in sight of the 
Isle of Martenique,
 and the tenth arrived in the Bay called 
Cu∣sack:
 The 
French
 being advertised of their coming, appeared in readi∣ness, marching towards the shoar, and the Dutch with some small

ships that sailed near the land, told them their errand, by firing smart∣ly against them from aboard? this salute forced the 
French
 a little to retreat, and burn some houses, which they thought stood in their way, and favoured the Enemy: In the afternoon a Council of War being held, a descent was conclu∣ded on, and 
de Ruyter
 having given the signe of landing, the land∣forces divided into 3. squadrons, under the Command of Col. 
Vy∣tenhove,
 with 20 men to throw gra∣nadoes for each Squadron, imme∣diatly embarked in their boats and shalloops, and with great cou∣rage, notwithstanding the 
French
 violent firing on them from their ships which they had ashoar, and out of their woods, landed and made themselves Masters of a Bank, which the 
French
 had cast up to prevent their landing, and forced the Enemy to retire to their Fort: 
De Ruyter
 perceiving

the Engagement hot, sent off 1500. seamen to reinforce his par∣ty, but the 
French
 firing furious∣ly from behinde their ships, and battery, which they had raised, flanking the 
Dutch
 who stood na∣ked to their shot, and whose Ca∣non did them little service, to∣wards the Evening beat them off again to their ships, with the loss of many men, and several brave Officers, and so freed the Island at this time from further dan∣ger.


De Ruyter
 after much loss find∣ing the attempt fruitless, left four ships to cruise thereabouts, and wait the coming of some Victu∣allers expected from 
Holland,
 and next day sailed to 
Dominico,
 there to take in fresh water, which be∣ing done, passing by 
Mevis
 and the 
Barmoodoes,
 and having mu∣tually received and rendered ci∣vilities with the 
English
 there, made sail for 
Holland,
 and about

latter end of 
September,
 with lit∣tle success in this expedition, ar∣rived safely at home, and 
Trump
 and 
Van-Horn
 having by several descents on 
Bell-Isle,
 and other parts of that coast of 
France,
 al∣larmed and vexed the 
French,
 and plundered the country; and the fleet having after conducted and brought back from 
Spain
 the Count 
Van Horn,
 who went to negotiate at 
Madrid,
 with 18 sail of the fleet (the rest being other∣ways imployed) in the latter end of 
November
 following, returned likewise to the 
Texell.


Now the difficulty of the re∣ducing 
Messina,
 so strongly pro∣tected by the 
French,
 requiring much of the care and Forces of 
Spain
 to be employed in 
Sicily,
 sensibly weakened the Confede∣rates of the States of 
Holland
 in 
Flanders,
 where the danger lay at their doors. The States there∣fore being sollicited by the Mi∣nisters

of 
Spain,
 that they might either give a necessary diversion to the 
French,
 who in good ear∣nest espoused the quarrel, and endeavoured the assistance of the 
Messinesses,
 and thereby hinder the progresse nearer home; or that they might effectually aid the 
Spaniards
 to the intire subduing of these Revolters, and so bring over to 
Flanders
 the 
Spanish
 For∣ces, and other instruments of war employed in these parts; In the beginning of 1675. resolved to dispatch their successeful Admi∣ral 
De Ruyter,
 with a considera∣ble fleet of Men of war into the 
Streights,
 to joyn the Prince 
Mon∣tesarchio
 Generall of the 
Spanish Armada
 for the effecting of that designe; accordingly about the latter end of 
August, de Ruyter
 with a fleet of 25. sail, wyed from 
Schonvelt,
 and having stopt at 
Ca∣diz,
 and other places, by the way, in 
December
 following joyn∣ed

Montesarchio
 at 
Palermo
 with part of his Fleet, and after that he had stayed some time for those of his Ships which then were re∣turned to 
Naples
 from 
Argiers
 under the Command of Vice-Ad∣miral 
de Haen,
 and received them at the place of Rendevouz: They sailed all together from 
Palermo
 to 
Melazzo,
 where 
de Ruyter
 ha∣ving had conference with the Duke of 
Ferrandina
 the Spanish Viceroy of 
Sicily,
 It was resolved that the 
Dutch
 and 
Spanish
 Fleet by Sea, and the Vice-roy by Land should attacque and molest 
Messina,
 before that any further succours did arrive there: In or∣der to that, 
de Ruyter
 being in∣formed of a Fleet of Ships laden with provisions and necessaries for the besieged who then were in great straits by want, and not like long to subsist without re∣lief, being at sea under the Con∣voy of a squadron of Men of

War commanded by the 
Sieur de Quesny,
 made towards the fare of 
Messina
 to intercept and hinder their passage; and whilest the Prince 
Montesarchio
 left with some ships to guard the mouth of the fare, was separated from the rest of the Fleet, on the 29th of 
January,
 1675. 
de Ruyter
 en∣countred the 
French
 off of 
Lipari,
 with a fleet not much odd in number to his own, having both between twenty and thirty sail of Men of War a piece, besides galleys, fireships, and other small craft, and with much courage and bravery engaged them: The 
French
 received him with no less resolution; so that there began a very brisk dispute betwixt them, which continued all that day and the next, with considerable damage to their Ships and rigging, but no great losse of men, the fight having been at some distance: In this

engagement the 
French
 lost one man of War, and two fireships, and the 
Dutch
 one Fregat, which being disabled in the engage∣ment, as the Galleys were towing of her off for 
Palermo,
 sunk, but the men were saved. The day following 
de Ruyter
 being advi∣sed, that the 
Sieur de Quesny
 by another way round the Island, unperceived by the 
Dutch,
 had conveyed the destin'd succours into 
Messina;
 and foreseeing well the bad consequences of the dis∣appointment, being much dis∣pleased with the slow proceedings of the 
Spanish
 grave & Phlegma∣tick circumspection, and their conduct of affairs; thought it not convenient further to pursue the 
French,
 nor to abide longer in these quarters, (the six Moneths appointed by the States his Ma∣sters for that expedition being now expired) and therefore ha∣ving rejoyned 
Montesarchio
 with

his eight Spanish Men of War, he took his leave of him, in order to his returning home∣ward.


This sudden departure threat∣ned by 
de Ruyter,
 put the Vice∣roys of 
Sicily
 and 
Naples
 in great perplexity, and the Court of 
Spain
 in much trouble, who judged thereby the businesse of 
Messina
 almost desperate; so that all means possible were used by the Agents of 
Spain,
 to retain him in these parts; and particularly importunate in∣stances in 
Holland
 for the pro∣longing the time of his Commis∣sion, which prevailed.


New Orders from 
Holland
 be∣ing arrived at 
Naples,
 the Vice∣roy the Duke 
de los Velos,
 fearing that 
de Ruyter
 might pass with∣out touching there, and so misse of receiving of his Letters, of so great concern to the 
Spanish
 in∣terest: sent off the Dutch Con∣sul

with some Galleys to meet him, and to acquaint him with the will of the States, and to in∣vite him to 
Naples:
 This occasi∣oned 
de Ruyters
 coming to 
Naples,
 where he was splendidly enter∣tained by the Vice-roy; and in visiting the City treated with the same honours as are usually rendred to his own person, but hastened again aboard. The ad∣vice sent from 
Holland
 of his Commission renewed, and a re-inforcement of his Fleet pro∣mised, set him at work to ani∣mate and push forward the slow and heavy march of the Spaniards in the execution of their Goun∣sils; and so having cruised with his Fleet some time at 
Palermo,
 and some time at 
Melazzo;
 and had conference with the Vice∣roy of 
Sicily:
 It was condescend∣ed on, that 
Augusta,
 a place that held for the Rebels, should be invested by Sea and Land, and

accordingly 
de Ruyter
 with his fleet made haste for the 
Bay of Au∣gusta,
 a place to him too satal for so famous a name; whilest he was there, intelligence was brought him, that the 
French
 were at Sea; whereupon that night he sailed, and next morn∣ing got sight of the Enemy, they being about the Cape 
Spartivento,
 and he himself with his fleet three Leagues from 
Augusta:
 The morn∣ing was calm, so that he could not come up with the Enemy, but in the afternoon a fresh gale blowing from S. E. brought both fleets nearer together: 
De Ruyter
 being in the Van, the 
Spaniards
 in the body, and Vice-Admiral 
de Haen
 in the Rear of the fleet, which besides the 
Spanish
 consist∣ed but of seventeen 
Dutch
 Men of War, with other galleys, fire∣ships and small craft; They bore down with great eagerness upon the 
French,
 consisting of thirty

Men of war, and seven fireships, with galleys, and other Tenders: About four in the afternoon the fight began, and lasted till seven, with obstinate resolution and cou∣rage, betwixt the 
Dutch
 and 
French,
 who sustained the whole brunt of this Engagement; for the 
Spanish
 did but little, only kept themselves out of harms way, and did what mischief they could at a distance.


The 
Dutch
 had in this Engage∣ment three Ships so disabled as to be towed off, and one Captain kil∣led, but smaller losses are undis∣cernable when the great 
De Ruyter
 fell; For here it was that pres∣sing the 
French
 at the latter end of the Fight, so as to make them give way; a bold bullet from the Enemies Fleet stopt him in his carreer; which having carri∣ed away part of his left foot, and broke his left leg above the ancle, threw him on the deck,

so as by his fall he was woun∣ded in the head: The Fleet here∣upon slackened sail, and stood for the Bay of 
Syracusa:
 The wounded General was carried a∣shoar for the more conveniency of cure; which then did not seem desperate, but the greatness of his minde unacquainted with such checks of fortune, encrea∣sed so that distemper of body; which it patiently bore, that the nineteenth of 
April
 having been speechless a day before, be∣tween nine and ten of the Clock at night, in the Seveniteth year and Second Moneth of his Age, at the first violent summons of Fortune; yeelded his last Duty to Nature; and as he had lived, died in the embraces of beloved honour.


This his Death, as it filled his friends and Countrey with grief and lamentation, and all men with pitty and regret, so

being a losse great enough to cast the ballance of advantage even to the most forlorn and des∣pairing side; gave the 
French
 a Victory not equalled by their confederate Adversaries, unless when last year Triumphant 
Tu∣rene
 the only Paragon of his worth and fame, upon a different Stage, played his last Act: which two great Champions much un∣like in their Original (the one being born to a great share of his honour, and the other to make all his own,) did so re∣semble each other, in the course of their Lives and Fortune, and manner and Circumstances of dying; that it seemed nature had framed them for two Sub∣jects whereon Fortune might shew her skill, in dispencing e∣qually her inclinations to great and powerfull adversaries in the highest pitch of competition. For as either had been the constant

Favourite of their respective Masters, and the often and long experieneed prop of their Victo∣rious hopes; the one at Land, and the other at Sea, so both fell by an interchanged great Shot, in such a point of time, when their actions gave great hopes and confidence to their several Parties; and their death was at∣tended with remarkable and dangerous consequences to either side: and had Fortune proceed∣ed from the beginning, and should she still continue with so even and impartial a hand in all the occurrences and transactions, of this formidable war; both parties might have occasion to celebrate their triumphs with tears, and with drawn stakes sit down, and mutually confess, that


Iam sumus ergo pares.




De Ruyter
 was a person (as most brave men have been) of a middle stature, a strong and well compacted body, not fat, but fleshy, of a gracefull and majestick countenance, his as∣pect pleasant and chearfull, not terrible by too much fierceness, nor by too great mildeness un∣awful; of a complexion san∣guine, and a constitution tempe∣rate and healthfull; sober in his diet, and moderate, though free in his words; neither sullen with rigid and morose reservedness, nor by loquacity affected or vain; his gestures manly and natural; and generally of a frame of tem∣per so even and harmonious, as rendred him sedate and constant, and altogether free from the mistakes and waverings that ac∣company fickle and light natures, in the greater vicissitudes of for∣tune: He advanced to the height of Honour by the regular steps

of merit and patience, never im∣portuning his destiny by untime∣ly and precipitant ambition; nor slighting or being out of the way when Fortune called him to preferment: which he con∣ducted by such wise and prudent measures, as made him accepta∣ble to all; not staining the repu∣tation of his great actions by vain-glorious ostentation, and overweening pride; but by being dutiful to his superiours, respect∣full to his equalls, gratefull to his benefactors, affable and cour∣teous to his inferiours; and in a word, obliging to all: he gained the love and esteem of all that knew him; entertaining e∣ven the meanest of the acquain∣tances of his low estate with that civility, that if in the top of honour, they enjoyed not the ancient familiarity of his baser fortune, they easily saw, that it was his place and dignity, and

not the change of humour, that altered the stile. 
In fine,
 he was so good a man, so devout and pious a Christian, so stout a Souldier, so wise, expert, and successfull a General; and so faithfull, trusty, and honest a Lover of his Countrey, that he deserves justly to be recommen∣ded to Posterity, as an ornament of his Age, the darling of the Seas, and the delight and ho∣nour of his Countrey.
