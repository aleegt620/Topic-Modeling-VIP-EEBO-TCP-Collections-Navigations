CHARLES II.


King of England, Scot∣land,
France, and Ire∣land,
&c.


Dread Soveraign,


T
HIS small
Treatise, or
Description,
of Your Ma∣jesties

of


Your MAJESTIES most

THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.


HAving the Favour of some

Notes
 from my Honoured
Friend 
Sir Thomas Linch
Knight,
 about the 
Descrip∣tion

of the 
Island
 of 
Jamaica,
 whose
Worth and Ingenuity hath lately
merited from his 
Majesty the Go∣vernment

of the said 
Isle;
 as like∣wise
the opportunity of several 
Pa∣pers



relating to the 
Affairs
 and 
De∣scription

of the other 
Isles
 and 
Ter∣ritories

in 
America,
 wherein the

English
 are concerned, which I re∣ceived
from the hands of several
of my 
Friends
 who are related
thereunto, I thought them very
fit to be 
Published.
 The said

Notes
 and 
Papers
 I have digested
into a clearer and more compen∣dious
Method; being brief 
De∣scriptions

thereof, which this small

Treatise
 only aimeth at; and not
to trouble the 
Reader
 with large
and unnecessary discourses no ways
proper for the Design in hand:
for by that means, I might (by the
help of a large 
Print
 which some
Publisher of 
Books
 call Ornamen∣tal)
have put them to an unne∣cessary
charge in Buying, and as
great a trouble in Reading. I
have also added some 
Maps
 for


the more utility thereof, which
were taken from the 
Latest Sur∣veys.


Rich. Blome.

A NEW
SURVEY,
OR,
Description of the Island of
JAMAICA.


THe Island of 
Jamaica
 lyeth
betwixt the 
Tropicks
 in
the 17.
 and 18. De∣grees
of 
Northern Lati∣tude;

and beareth from off the
Island of 
Hispaniola
 Eastward, a∣bout
35. Leagues.


From the Island of 
Cuba
 North∣wards,
about 20. Leagues.



From 
Porto Bello
 Southwards,
about 160. Leagues.


From 
Carthagena
 South-easter∣ly
about 140. Leagues.


From 
Rio de la Hache
 in the
Continent South-easterly, 160.
Leagues.




The forme and Extent of
the Isle.


It is something inclined to an
Oval Forme,
 being from East to
West 170 Miles in length; and
from North to South in the midst
where it is broadest about 70, it
waxing narrower and narrower
at both extream ends.


From East to West along the
the midst of the 
Isle
 runns a con∣tinued
Ridge of lofty 
Mount
ins

which are full of fresh 
Springs,

whence flow the many Rivers that


so plentifully waters the 
Island,
 to
the great refreshment and accom∣modation
of the 
Inhabitants.






The Soyle, Fertility, &c.


It is in most parts (especially the
north) of a rich and fat 
Soyle,
 be∣ing
of a 
blackish Earth,
 in many
places mixt with a 
Clay,
 and in
some, as the south West 
Parts,

it is of a more red and loose 
Earth,

but every where incomparable
apt to produce, and liberally to
answer the 
Cultivators
 cost and
paines for what is planted; being
alwayes 
Springing,
 and its 
Trees

and 
Plants
 never disrobed of their

summer Livery,
 every month be∣ing
to them as our 
May,
 or 
April.


Here are many 
Savanas
 which
are intermixed with the 
Hills

and 
Woods,
 (especially in the


North and South parts, where are
great store of wild 
Cattel)
 which
by report were sometimes 
Feilds

of 
Indian Maiz,
 or 
Wheat,
 which
when the 
Spaniards
 became

Masters
 of the 
Isle,
 they conver∣ted
to 
Pasture
 for the feeding of
their 
Cattel;
 bringing hither
from 
Spain, Horses, Cowes, Hoggs,

and 
Asenegros
 for a Breed, after
they had destroyed all the 
Na∣tives,

or 
Indians,
 which according
to calculation, did amount to a∣bout
60000. which 
Cattel
 did
exceedingly encrease, witness the
great heards of 
Horses,
 and other

Cattel,
 that are now wild in the

Woods;
 besides the great quan∣tities
of 
Cows
 that have been
Killed by the 
English,
 since they
became 
Masters
 thereof: And
these 
Savanas
 are the most bar∣ren,
as being so long made use


of without Tillage; yet doth they
produce such great Plenty of 
Grass,

that the 
English
 are constrained
oft-times to burn it up.






The Air, and Temperature.


The 
Air
 is here more tempe∣rate
then in any of the 
Caribbee
Isles,
 as seated more Northerly,
and of as mild a temperature (as
to 
Heate)
 as any place between
the 
Tropicks,
 being always cooled
with fresh Breezes, that constant∣ly
bow easterly, and refreshed
with frequent 
Showers
 of 
Rain,

and such 
Dews
 that fall in the
night (much quickning the growth
of what is 
Planted)
 that it may
truly be called 
temperate
 and
healthful; and by reason of its
continuall 
Verdure
 (as I have be∣fore
noted) exceeding Delight∣ful.



And it is observed that the west
and east 
Parts
 of the 
Isle
 are most
subject to 
Raine
 and 
Windes;
 and
the 
Woods
 being also thick, and
close, rendreth the 
Aire
 less agree∣able,
then the North and South
Parts, which are more plain and
open, and less subject to 
Raine

and 
Winds.
 The 
Mountaines

which run along the midle of the

Isle
 from one extreame point to
the other, are much Cooler then
the other parts, insomuch that oft
times in the mornings there is small
white 
Frosts.


This 
Island
 is in no parts
troubled with those 
storms
 of 
Wind

called 
Huricanes,
 which all the 
Ca∣ribbee
Isles
 are much pestered with,
having somtimes by the violence
of those 
Gusts,
 their 
Ships
 forced
out of their 
Roads;
 and on 
Shore,

their 
Houses
 blown down, and 
pro∣visions,



&c. rooted out of the
Earth.






The Weather.


The 
Weather
 of this 
Isle
 is less
certain then in the rest of the 
Ca∣ribbee
Islands;
 the most observa∣ble
wett 
seasons
 are in 
November

or 
May;
 there being no seem∣able

Winter
 but by a little more

Rain,
 and 
Thunder,
 in the winter
months.


The winds here constantly blow
all the day from nine in the mor∣ning
easterly, and become more
fresher as the 
Sun
 mounteth
higher, by reason of which, at
midd-day 
Travel
 or 
Labour
 is suf∣ferable.
But from eight at 
Night

to about eight in the 
Morning,
 it
frequently blows Westerly; and
with these 
Winds,
 or 
Breezes,
 the



Vessells
 get out of the 
Harbours,

and ply to wind-ward.


There is scarce any sencible
lengthning or shortning of the

Days
 or 
Nights,
 but are almost
alwayes of an equal length.


The Sea 
ebbs
 and 
flowes
 sel∣dome
above a foot.


Hurricanes
 are here never
known, as before I have noted;
nor hath any 
Vessel
 been lost, or
cast away on the 
Coast,
 since the

English
 were 
Masters
 of it.






The Commodities, which this
Island Produceth.


This 
Isle
 hath, and produceth
many excellent 
Commodities
 and
that in exceeding great Plenty,
as 
Sugars
 so good, that they out∣sell
those of the 
Barbadoes
 5. s. 
per
Cent.
 there being at present about



Sugar Works,
 which may produce
yearly 1710 thousand weight of

Sugar,
 those still encreasing, and
divers others a going up.


Cocao,
 the principal,
 and most
beneficial 
Commodity
 of the 
Isle,

which I shall anon take occasion
to speak of more at large; and
that by reason of the aptness of
the ground to produce and beare
it above other places: here being
at present above 60. 
Cocao Walks;

besides abundance of young 
Walks

which are a growing up, and still
more a planting, so that in time
it will become the only noted
place for that 
Commodity
 in the
world, which is so much made use
of by us, and other 
Nations,
 but
in far greater measure by the 
Spa∣niards

who alone are enough to
take of the product of the 
Isle;
 so
that there is no fear that it will


become a drugg, and lye upon the
hands of the 
Planter.


Indico
 this 
Isle
 produceth very
good,
 there being at present more
then 60. 
Indico Works,
 which
may produce about 50000. weight
of 
Indico per. Annum,
 and do like∣wise
much encrease.


Cotton
 here hath an especial
fineness,
 and is by all preferred
before that of the 
Carribbee Isles.


Tobacco
 is here indifferent
good,
 being esstemed better then
that of the 
Barbadoes,
 but it is not
much planted, only a sufficiency
to serve themselves; the other
Commodities being more beni∣ficial.


Hydes,
 of which great quanti∣tyes
have been Yearly made, and
are found to be very large and
good.


Great store of 
Tortoises
 are ta∣ken


on this 
Coast,
 whose meat
(being excellent) they eat, and
their 
Shells
 so much esteemed
here in 
England
 for several curi∣ous

Works,
 finds good vent.


Here are great variety of 
Woods

for 
Dyers,
 as 
Fustick, Red-Wood,
 a
kind of 
Logg-Wood,
 &c. also

Caedar, Mothogeney, Brasilletto,
Lignum-Vitae, Ebony, Granadil∣la,

and many other excellent sweet
smelling, and curious 
Woods
 fitt
for choise 
Works,
 whose names
are as yet not known; nor indeed
their excellencies; but are ex∣ported
in great quantities.


Copper,
 they are assured is in this

Isle,
 for they have seen the 
Ore,

wrought out of a 
Mine
 here; and
by the 
Spaniards
 report, the 
Bells

that hung in the great Church of
St. 
Iago,
 were cast of the Cop∣per
of this 
Island.




Silver
 may probably be here,

as well as in 
Cuba,
 and in the

Maine;
 and the 
English
 have been
shewed where the 
Spaniards
 had
found a 
Silver Mine,
 behind the

Mountains
 west of 
Cagway.


Ambergreece
 (according to the

Spaniards
 report) hath been often
found on this 
Coast.


Salt,
 this 
Island
 might make great
quantities, there being already
3. good and very large 
Salt-ponds,

containing neare 4000. 
Acres

of ground; but as yet they
make no more then for their own
use: although there was made in
one 
Yeare
 about 10000 
Bushells;

and the manager thereof, 
Cap.
Jo. Noye,
 did affirm that he could
have made as many 
Tunns
 if they
had had Vent.


Saltpeter
 hath been found in
many parts of the 
Island.




Ginger
 grows better in this 
Isle,

then in many of the 
Carribbe
Islands;
 of which here is suffici∣ency
planted.


Codd-pepper
 which is so common∣ly
used in all the 
West Indies,

grows plentifully here.


Piemente,
 or 
Jamaica Pepper,

a spice of the form of 
East-India
Pepper,
 very Aromatical, and
of a curious 
Gousto,
 having the
mixt taste of divers 
Spices,
 grows
here in great plenty, wild in the

Mountains.
 But the 
Spaniards

did sett a high esteeme thereon,
and exported it as a very choise

Commodity,
 as indeed it is; and
now it is begun to be planted by
the 
English,
 and will become a
good 
Commodity.


Drugs
 are here in great abun∣dance,

as 
Guacum, China-Roots,
Sasapharilla, Cashia Fistula, Ta∣merindes,


Vinillos, Achiots
 or 
A¦netto,

which is like to prove a good

Commodity.
 Here are also dive


Gums,
 and 
Roots,
 wherewith ex∣perienced

Planters
 do cure ma∣ny

Hurts, Ulcers,
 and 
Distem∣pers

of the Body. And by the
report of an intelligent 
Doctor,

which made it his business to
search after such things, here are
likewise 
Contrayerna, Cyperas,
Aloes, Assole Pie, Adjuntum,
Nigrum, Cucumis, Agrestis, Su∣mach,
Acacia, Miselto,
 with ma∣ny
other 
Druggs, Balsoms
 and

Gums,
 whose 
names
 are not
known, or remembred: but the

Planters
 begin to be more expert
in these 
Drugs,
 and endeavour to
encrease them, and supply 
Eng∣land

therewith.


Cochaneil
 is produced by a

Plant
 that grows in this 
Isle,
 but


as yet the 
English
 want experi∣ence
to husband it; easterly 
Winds,

and many other things being Ene∣mies
to its growth, besides the
difficulty of makeing it.


These with some others are the
Commodities that this 
Island
 pro∣duceth,
which if well improved,
would soon become the best, and
Richest 
Plantation
 that ever the

English
 were, (or are like to be)
Masters of.


I shall in the next place give
you an Account of the manage∣ment
of a 
Cocao Walk,
 with a
calculation of its 
Costs,
 and 
Profits,

as it was lately estimated by that
judicious and great encourager of
the Planters, 
S. Tho. Modiford
Baronett,
 late 
Governour
 of the said

Island.








Directions about a Cocao
Walk.




First, take up 5 or 600.

Acres
 of 
Land,
 which be
sure choose in a good
place proper to produce
the 
Cocao,
 which will cost
for the 
Surveying
 and 
Pa∣tent

010 l. 0 s.


For 3 
Negro men,
 and
as many 
Negro women
 at
20 
l. per
 head
120 l. 0 s.


For 4 
White Servants,

with their Passage and
Dyet for a year
080 l. 0 s.


For 20 
Axes, 20 Bills,

and 20 
Hoos
 for them
005 l. 0 s.



For 6. 
Negroes Dyet,

for Six months at 2 
s.
per Day,
 until you
have some provisions

Grown
 in your 
Planta∣tion.

018 l. 5 s.


For an 
Overseer
 to
look after the 
Servants,

for his 
Wages▪
 and 
Diet

at 40 
s. per Month

024 l. 0 s.


In all
257 l. 5 s.




And for the employing these

Servants
 in your 
Plantation
 as
followeth: supposing them to

Land,
 and to be on the 
Plantati∣on

the first of 
March,
 and that
they have by the middle of that
month (as they may very easily)
cleared a convenient place, and
built fitting houseing for the lodg∣ing


them. Then put them to fal∣ling,
cleaning, and planting a

Potato peece
 of 4. 
Acres,
 which

ten hands
 will very well do by
the middle of 
April:
 after this,
you may clean, and plant with

Rue
 and 
Plantin-Trees,
 until the
last of 
February,
 which is above
10 
Months;
 in which time they
may with ease have cleansed and
Planted 21. 
Acres,
 besides keep∣ing
them clean which are Planted
and are still a Planting; and in
this time, which compleats the

Year,
 you may be full of 
Potatoes

and 
Corn,
 and within 2. 
Months

of the new 
Year,
 with 
Plantins,

and a small stock of 
Hoggs,
 and

Fowles;
 so that you will be at no
more charge for 
Provisions
 for your

Servants.
 And then to keep this
clean, and to plant the 
Cocao-Walk,

and for five more 
Negro


Men,
 and 5. 
Negro-Women
 to
buy about the first of 
March
 fol∣lowing,
at 20 
l. per Negroe
 comes to
200 
l.


And in that 
Month
 you will have
Planted 
Cocao-Trees
 out of the

Nuts,
 or 
Seed,
 betwixt all the

Rows
 of the 
Plantin-Trees,
 that
are 6. 
Foot
 high; so that by the
first of 
June,
 the whole 21 
Acres

that were planted the last 
Year,

will be full of 
Cocao-Trees,
 and by
that time you will have (besides
much other work done) 21. 
Acres

of 
Cocao-Trees
 in the ground;
which in less then 4. years, from
the Planting, will begin to bear

Cods,
 and in a year after, produce
compleat Cropps. And according
to experience, an 
Acre
 doth produce
every year about 1000. pound

Weight;
 which at 
Jamaica
 is worth
4 
l. per Cent.
 which for the 21 
Acres,



doth amount unto 840 
l. per Ann.
Although
 this last year, by reason
their 
Cropps
 were blasted, it is at
present far dearer, the 
Hundred
weight
 at 
London
 being now worth
18. pound 
Sterling.


The charges of gathering and
houseing the 
Cocao,
 is inconside∣rable,
only 
Cloths
 or 
Baggs
 to put
it in, which with some other in∣cident
charges, may be reckoned
at the most (as all things else have
been) to Amount to 42. l. 15. s.
more, which makes up just 500. l.


Note, that all this that is 
Plan∣ted,

is done in 15. 
months,
 and the

Cocao
 bears not compleatly until
the sixth year from the first be∣gining,
or comming; so that you
will have four years and nine
months at liberty with your 
Ser∣vants,

either to encrease the 
Co∣cao-Walk,

building of conveni∣ent


houses, and makeing of 
Gar∣idens

for pleasure; or else you
may fall on 
Ginger, Indico,
 or
some other 
Commodity
 for present
profit, which perhapps may be
necessary for such as cannot for∣bear
their Money, until the 
Cocao
Walk
 doth come to perfection as
aforesaid: after which, you will
find sufficient profit as is exprest,
Sickness,
 Mortality, and running
away Excepted. Yet it cannot be
expected, but that as the 
Island

encreaseth in this 
Commodity,
 they
must some-what abate the present
Price, and content themselves
with a more moderate Gaines.


And according to this 
Calcula∣tion

proportionably a greater or
lesser 
Cocao-Walk
 may be under∣taken,
and performed.






Their Cattle.


In this 
Isle
 are greater abun∣dance


of 
Cattle
 then in most of
the 
English Plantations
 in 
Ameri∣ca;

as 
Horses,
 which are here so
plentiful, that a good 
Horse
 may be
bought for 6 or 7 
l.


Their 
Cowes
 are very large,

and so numerous, that although
there hath been every Year so
many Killed, yet their number
seemeth not much to be lessoned.


Assnegroes
 and 
Mules
 (both
wild and Tame) are very many,

which are found to be very ser∣viceable
to the 
Inhabitants.


Their 
Sheep
 are large,
 and tall,
and their 
Flesh
 good, but their 
Wool

is long, hairy, and little worth.


Goats
 are many,
 which thrive
exceedingly well, the Countrey
being very fit for them.


Hoggs
 are here in exceeding
great plenty,
 as well those wild in
the 
Mountains,
 as tame in the



Plantations,
 whose 
Flesh
 is far
better tasted, and more nourish∣ing
and easier to be digested then
those of 
England;
 which is the
reason that it is so much eaten in
this 
Island;
 as indeed throughout
the 
West-Indies.






Their Fish.


This 
Island
 hath both in the

Rivers,
 
Bayes, Roads,
 and 
Creeks,

very excellent 
Fish,
 and in such
abundance that it contributes
much to the feeding of the 
In∣habitants;

and those that frequent
this 
Isle,
 say, that they have few
or none of those sorts common
to us in 
England;
 but such great
Variety of those appropriated to
the 
Indies,
 that it would be too
tedious to Repeat the names of
them, if they were known or Re∣membred.



The principal sort is the 
Tortoise,

which they take plentifully on
the 
Coast;
 and about 20. or 30.

Leagues to the Leeward
 of port

Negril,
 by the Isles of 
Camavos,
 in
the months of 
May, June,
 and 
Ju∣ly,

do resort great store of 
Ships

from the 
Carribbee Isles
 to 
Victual

and 
Load
 with this 
Fish,
 it being
reputed to be the wholsomest and
best provision in all the 
Indies.






Their Fowls.


Here are very great plenty of
tame 
Hens,
 
Turkies,
 and some

Ducks;
 but of wild 
Fowle
 infi∣nite
store, as 
Ducks, Teale, Wigen,
Geese, Turkeys, Pigeons, Guine-Hens,
Plovers, Flemingo's, Snipes,
Parats, Parachetos,
 with very many
others, whose names are not
known.








The Fruits.


There are great plenty of choise
and excellent
 Fruits 
in this
 Island,

as Oranges, Pome-granates, Cocar-Nuts,
Limes, Guavars, Mammes,
Alumee-Supotas, Suppotillias, Avo∣catas,
Cashues, Prickle-Aples,
Prickle-Pears, Grapes, Sower-Sops,
Custard-Aples, Dildowes, 
and many
others whose names are not known,
or too tedious to name, besides

Plantains, Pines, 
&c.






Their Herbes, and Roots.


Here likewise grows very well,
all manner of Summer-
Garden-Herbs

and 
Roots
 common to us in

England,

as 
Radish, Lettis, Pur∣seley,
Cucumbers, Melons, Pars∣ley,
Pot-herbs,
 also 
Beanes, Pease,


Cabbages, Colly-Flowers,
 &c.






Their Diseases.


It hath been experimentally
found,
 that there is no such Anti∣pathy
betwixt the constitutions of
the 
English,
 and this clime, for
the occasioning Sickness to be
Mortal or Contageous, more than
in other parts; for if a good 
Dy∣et,

and moderate Exercises are
used, without excess of 
Drinking

they may enjoy a competent mea∣sure
of Health.


The 
Diseases
 that Strangers are
most incident to,
 are 
Dropsies
 (occa∣sioned
often by ill 
diet, drunkeness,

and 
slothfulness) Calentures
 too fre∣quently
the product of 
Surfits,

also 
Feavers,
 and 
Agues,
 which
although very troublesome, yet are
seldome Mortal.



And the reason of the great
Mortality of the 
Army,
 at their
first arrival, was their want of 
Pro∣visions,

together with an unwil∣lingness
to labour or excercise, joy∣ned
with discontent.






Hurtful things.


There are upon this 
Island,
 very
few obnoctious 
Beasts, Insects,
 or

Plants.


Here is the 
Manchonele,
 which is
a king of a 
Crab,
 so common in all
the 
Caribbee Isles.


Here are 
Snakes,
 and 
Guianas,

but no poysonous quality is ob∣served
in them.


In many of the 
Rivers,
 and 
Land-Ponds,

are 
Alligators,
 which are
very voracious Creatures, yet
seldome do they prey upon a Man,
as being very easy to be avoided,


for he can only move forwards, and
that he doth with great Swiftness
and Strength, and is as slow in tur∣ning.
Some are 10, 15, or 20
foot long, their backs are scaly
and impenetrable, so that they
are hardly to be killed, except in
the 
Belly
 or 
Eye.
 They have
four 
Feet
 or 
Finns
 with which they
go or swim. They are observed
to make no kind of Noise: and the
usual course for the getting their
Prey, is to lie on the 
banks
 of 
Ri∣vers,

and as any 
Beast
 or 
Fowle
 com∣eth
to 
drink,
 they suddenly seize
on them; and the rather, for that
they do so much resemble a long
peece of dry wood, or some dead
thing. And as these 
Allegators
 are
thus obnoctious on the one hand,
so are they found to be useful on
the other, for their Fat is a Sove∣reign

Oyntment
 for any internal


Ach or Pain in the 
Joynts,
 or 
Bones.

They have in them 
Musk-codds,

which are stronger scented then
those of the 
East-Indies,
 and by
this their strong smell, they are
discovered, and avoyded; which

s supposed the Cattle by in∣stinct
of Nature, are also sencible of,
and do by that means often shun
them. They lay 
Eggs
 in the Sand
lay the water-side, which are no
bigger than a 
Turkeys,
 which they

over, and by the heat of the 
Sun,

the young ones are hatched, who
naturally creep into the water.


Here are also 
Muskettoes
 and

Merry-wings,
 a sort of stinging

Flies
 that are troublesome in some
parts of the 
Isle,
 but are seldome
found in the 
English Plantations.








Their Harbours, Roads, and Bays▪


This 
Island
 abounds with goo


Bayes, Roads,
 and 
Harbours:
 th

Principal amongst which are


Port-Royal,
 formerly called 
Cag¦way,

situate on the extream en

of that long point of 
Land
 whic

makes the 
Harbour,
 which is e
¦ceeding
commodious for 
Shippin

and secured by one of the stronge

and most considerable 
Castles
 th

his 
Majesty
 hath in all 
Americ

in which are mounted about 6

peeces of 
Ordnance,
 and is we

guarded with 
Souldiers.
 It is land
lock't by a point of 
Land
 that run
12 miles 
South-East
 from the mai

of the 
Island,
 having the great 
R
¦ver

that runs by 
Los Angelos,
 and

St. 
Jago
 falling into it, where 
Ship

do commonly 
water,
 and conven
¦ently



wood.
 The 
Harbour
 is 2. or
3. leagues cross in most places, and
hath every where good 
Ancho∣rage,

which is so deep, that a 
Ship

of a 1000 
Tunn
 may lay her sides
to the shore of the 
Point,
 and load,
and unload with 
planks
 a Float:
which commodiousness, doth make
it to be the most frequented by

Men
 of 
War,
 and 
Merchants Ships

of any in the 
Island,
 and as much
inhabited by the 
Merchants, Store∣house-keepers,
Vintners,
 & 
Alehouse-keepers,

being the only noted place
of 
Trade
 in the 
Isle,
 and doth con∣tain
(since the 
English
 became 
Ma∣sters

of it) about 800. 
Houses,
 being
about 12 miles and a half in length,
and the houses are as dear-rented as
if they stood in well-traded 
Streets

in 
London;
 yet it's situation is very
unpleasant and uncommodious, ha∣ving
neither 
Earth, Wood,
 or 
Fresh∣water,



but only made up of a hot
loose 
Sand,
 and being thus popu∣lous,
and so much frequented, as
well by 
Strangers,
 as by the 
Plan∣ters,

in the negotiation of their
Affairs as being the scale of 
Trade,
provisions
 are very dear. This 
Town

or 
Port
 is seated about 12 
miles

from the 
Metrapolitan Town
 of the

Island
 called St. 
Jago,
 or St. 
Jago
de la vega,
 or the 
Spanish
 Town;
of which I shall treat anon.


Port-Morant
 in the 
Eastern
 Point,

a very Capacious and secure 
Har∣bour,

where 
Ships
 do convenient∣ly

Wood, Water,
 and 
Ride
 safe
from the 
Windes,
 and about this
place is a potent 
Colony
 of the

English seated.


Old-Harbour
 Westwards,
 from
St. 
Jago,
 a good 
Bay
 for 
Ships

to Ride in.


Point-Negril
 in the extream



Western
 Point, very good and suf∣ficiently
convenient, and secure
to windward, in which men of 
war

do often ply, when they look for
the 
Spanish Ships,
 whence a little

North-west,
 was seated the Old
town of 
Melilla,
 founded by 
Colum∣bus,

after the shipwrack there; which
was the 1
st
 place that the 
Spaniards

setled at, and afterwards deserted.


Port-Antonio
 seated on the

North,
 a very safe land-lock't-Har∣bour,
only the coming in is som∣what
difficult, the Channel being
narrowed by a little 
Island
 that
lies off the mouth of the 
Port,
 be∣ing
wholly taken up by the Right
Honourable, 
Charles
 Earl of 
Car∣lisle,

Visc. 
Howard
 of 
Morpeth,
 Lord

Dacres
 of 
Gilsland,
 Lord Lieute∣nant
of the Counties of 
Cumber∣land

and 
Westmerland,
 and one of
the Lords of his Majesties most
Honourable Privy Council, 
&c.



Here are several other good

Bayes,
 and 
Harbours,
 along the

Coast
 of this 
Island;
 the names of
which are set down in the 
Map,
 a∣mongst
which, these are very com∣modious
and good, 
viz.




In the South-part


Michaels Hole.


Micary Bay.


Allegator Pont.


Point Pedro.


Pallate Bay.


Lewana Bay.


Blewfelds Bay.


Cabaritaes Bay.



All
 very good 
and

Commodious Bayes

for Ships.








In the North-part


Porto-Maria


Ora Cabessa


Cold-Harbour


Rio-Nova


Montega-Bay


Orang-Bay



All
 very good
Bays 
for Shipping.












The Towns.


There are at present but three
Towns of considerable Note in
the Island, to wit,


St. 
Jago,
 or St. 
Jago de-lavega

seated 6 
Miles
 within the Land
North-West, in a 
Plaine,
 by a
River, and about 12. miles from

Port-Royal
 already treated of,
which makes another of the
3 Towns. This town of St. 
Jago

when the 
Spaniards
 were Masters
of the 
Isle,
 was a large 
City,
 and of
great Account, containing about
2000 
Houses,
 and for Divine Wor∣ship,
had 2 
Churches, 2 Chappels,

and an 
Abbey;
 which when the

English
 first took the 
Isle
 (under
the conduct of 
General Venables)

were destroyed to about 4 or 500

Houses,
 and its 
Churches
 and 
Chap∣pels



to a fewer number, & those that
remained were sufficiently Spoiled
and haraced. But since the 
English

have made a settlement, this 
Towne

is now of considerable account;
where the 
Governour
 resideth, and
where the chief 
Courts
 of 
Judica∣ture

are held, which makes it to be
well resorted unto, and Inhabited;
so that most of its ruinous 
Houses
 are
in a faire way of being repaired,
and in hopes to arrive to a greater
largeness then formerly it was,
here being several fair and well
built 
Houses:
 and the 
Inhabitants

live in great Pleasure, where they
have their 
Havana,
 in which the
better sort recreate themselves e∣very
evening in their 
Coaches,
 or
an horse-back, as the Gentry do
here in 
Hide Park.


Passage
 seated on the mouth
of the River, six miles distant from


St. 
Jago,
 and as many from 
Port-Royal,

where there are about
20 
Houses,
 built for the conveni∣ency
of going to 
Port-Royal;
 and
here is a 
Fort
 raised by the 
Eng∣lish,

the better to secure the
same.


In the time of the 
Spaniards,

here were several other 
Townes

which are now of no Account;
of which said 
Townes,
 these three
following were of most nore, viz.


Sevilla
 feared on the North
part of the 
Island,
 once beauti∣fied
with a 
Collegiate-Church,
 whose
chief bore the title of 
Abbot:
 a∣mongst
whom was 
Peter Martyr,

who described the 
History
 of the

West-Indies
 by 
Decates.


Mellila
 seated in the North
East,
 where 
Columbus
 mended his

Ships
 at his return from 
Veragua,

where he was neer 
Ship-wrackt.




Orista
 reguards the 
South-Sea,

in which are many 
Rocks,

and amongst their Banks, some

Isles,
 as 
Servavilla, Quitos∣vena,

and 
Serrana,
 where 
Au∣gustin
Pedro Serrana
 lost his 
Ves∣sel,

and saved onely himself, and
here in a solitary and lone Condi∣tion
passed away 3 Yeares; at the
end of which time he had the com∣pany
of a 
Marriner
 for 4 
Years

more, that was likewise there

Ship-wrackt,
 and also alone saved
himself.


And although there are for the
present no more 
Townes,
 yet the

Island
 is divided into 14 
Precincts,
Divisions,
 or 
Parishes,
 which are
set forth in the 
Map;
 many of
which said 
Precincts
 are well 
Inha∣bited

by the 
English,
 where they
have very good 
Plantations,
 e∣specially
all the southern part from



Point-Morant
 in the East, almost
to 
Point-Negrillo
 in the West, so far
as the ridge or chain of 
Mountaines

that runneth in the midst of the

Isle;
 nor are its northerns 
Parts,

(especially near unto the Sea) with∣out

Inhabitants
 and 
Plantations,

though not so thick as South-ward∣ly
about St. 
Jago,
 but of late have
much encreased. And for the bet∣ter
Satisfying the 
Reader,
 the 
Parts

throughout the 
Island
 where the

English
 have made their 
Settle∣ments,

are Marked and distingui∣shed
in the 
Map
 by 
Cyphers.


I cannot certainely affirm the
number of the 
English
 in this 
Isle,

but according to the last survey
taken and returned into 
England

some 
Yeares
 since, by Sr. 
Thomas
Modiford,
 late 
Governour,
 each

Precinct,
 or 
Parish
 contained as
followeth:

Note, that the Four Parishes
on the 
North
-side of the 
Isle,
 to
witt, St. 
George
's, St. 
Maries,
 St.

Annes,
 and St. 
James,
 as also the

Leeward
 most Parish called St. 
Eli∣zabeth,



together with these two
not named, both adjoyning on St.

Elizabeths;
 the one 
Eastwards,

and the other 
Northwards,
 was not
as then so particularly surveyed,
by reason of their distance, and new

Settlements,
 nevertheless they were
found according to Calculation, to
amount to about 2000 
Inhabitants.

But all these 
parts,
 as also those se∣ven
aforenamed are now excee∣dingly
encreased, being supposed to
be encreased to double, if not treble
the number. And the great en∣couragement
of gaining Riches,
with a pleasant life, doth invite e∣very
year abundance of 
People
 to
Inhabite here, quitting their con∣cerns
at 
Barbadoes,
 and other our

American Plantations;
 so that in
a short time without doubt it will
become the most potent and rich∣est

Plantation
 in the 
West-Indies.



And besides the aforesaid num∣ber
of 
Inhabitants
 in the said 14

Precincts
 or 
Parishes,
 there are
reckoned to belong to the 
Island;

of 
Privateers, Hunters, Sloop
 and

Boatmen
 (which ply about the 
Isle)

at the least 3000 lusty and stout

Fighting Men,
 whose courage hath
been sufficiently evidenced in their
late exploit, and attempt made a∣gainst
the 
Spaniards
 at 
Panama.






Their Lawes


Their 
Lawes
 are assimulated (as
near as may be) to those of 
Eng∣land,

having their several 
Courts▪
Magistrates,
 and 
Officers,
 for the
executing of Justice on criminal
Offenders, and the hearing and
determination of Causes or Con∣troversies
betwixt party, and party.


Having thus made a short des∣scription


of the 
Island,
 as to its 
Sci∣tuation,
Fertility, Commodities, Har∣bours,
Towns,
 and 
Precincts,
 with
an estimate of the number of its

Inhabitants:
 In the next place, I
shall give you the state of the 
Isle,

when the 
Spaniards
 were posses∣sors
thereof; and wind up my dis∣course
with some seasonable con∣siderations
relating to the 
English

Affairs in 
America,
 with reasons to
justifie the first design in taking it,
and why his 
Majesty
 should keep
and support it. And of these in
order.






The state of the Spaniards
in this Island,


The 
Spaniards
 first setled on the

North-west
 part of the 
Isle,
 under
the Conduct of 
Columbus,
 and built
the Town of 
Mellila,
 but disliking


the Scituation, removed to 
Orista∣na;

and finding that also to be ill
seated, and unhealthful, again re∣moved,
and setled at St. 
Jago,
 or
St. 
Jago de la vega,
 where, with
the assistance of the 
Indians,
 they
built a fair 
Town
 or 
City,
 which I
have already treated of. And in
this 
Town
 Inhabited all the 
Spani∣ards

that were in the 
Isle
 at the
Landing of the 
English,
 keeping
their slaves at their several small

Plantations,
 or 
Stanchas,
 who fail∣ed
not to bring them store of 
Fruits

& 
Provisions,
 which they luxurious∣ly
spent in their houses, never in∣tending
any thing but to live at ease
and plenty:
 For on this large and
fertile 
Island,
 there was no 
Manu∣facture

or 
Commodity
 made, except
a little 
Sugar, Tabacco,
 and 
Cocao,

and those few 
Ships
 that came hi∣ther,
traded generally for 
Hydes,


Tallow, Jamaica Pepper,
 and 
Cocao,

but not to any considerable ac∣count.
And the number of In∣habitants
did not exceed 3000, of
which, half (if not more) were

Slaves.
 And the reason why it
was so thinly peopled, was, be∣cause
the 
Spaniards
 generally de∣sire
to be in 
Nova Hispana,
 or 
His∣paniola;

but chiefly, because this

Isle
 was held▪ in proprietership, by
the heirs of the Duke of 
Veragua-Columbus,

who received the Re∣venues,
and placed 
Governours,
 as
absolute Lord of it. And at the
first, it was planted by a kind of 
Por∣tugals,

the society of whom, the

Spaniards
 abhors.


Upon the approach of the 
En∣glish-Army

after their landing, the

Inhabitants
 of St. 
Jago
 deserted
the 
Town,
 and betook themselves
to the 
Mountains,
 pretending a


Treaty with the 
English,
 untill such
time as they had secured their 
Wo∣men

and 
Goods,
 and then did they
make several attempts, and upon
surprisals, murthered many of the

English;
 but the 
Spaniards
 soon
growing weary of that wild and
mountainous course of Life, per∣ceiving
small hopes of expelling
the 
English,
 divers of the 
Grandees

got into 
Cuba,
 who by the 
Vice-Roy

of 
Alexico
's order, were com∣manded
back, with a promise of
a speedy and considerable supply
of men; upon which they returned,
somwhat encouraged, and disper∣sed
themselves by 
Families,
 that
they might the better get 
provisi∣ons,

and avoid the being discover∣ed
by the 
English;
 but this necessi∣tous
and unusual course of life, kil∣led
many of them, and discouraged
the rest; for that in all this time


there came to their succour, but
too 
Souldiers,
 and those refused
to joyn with them, as being so few
and sickly; so that they marched
back to the 
North
 of the 
Island,

and at a place called St. 
Chereras,

did fortify themselves, every day
expecting a new body of Men to
joyn with them: But the 
English

discovering their 
quarters,
 march∣ed
against them. Some few months
after, about 30 small 
Companies

of the 
Spanish Forces
 arrives, and
immediately very strongly Fortify

Rio Nova,
 having 
Ordnance,
 and
great store of 
Ammunition,
 yet
were they speedily and succesfully
defeated by the Valour of the 
En∣glish

under the Conduct of Leiute∣nant
General 
Edw. D'oyley.
 And
this grand disaster, with many pet∣ty
ill successes caused the 
Spaniards

to dispair of regaining the 
Island,



and to ship off most of their 
Plat

and 
Women;
 and the 
Negroes
 find∣ing
the greatest part of their Ma∣sters
to be dead, killed the 
Gover∣nour,

and declined all obedience to
the 
Spaniards,
 appointing a 
Black

for their 
Governour.
 And such
was the necessity of the 
Spaniards,

that instead of giving them fitting
correction, they were constrained
to Court them for their assistance;
but all their policy would not pre∣vail
upon them, for soon after did
they submitt to the 
English Gover∣ment,

and made discoveries of the

Spaniards
 and 
Negroes
 that would
not come in with them, and did
further assist the 
English
 in the ta∣king
of them, in which they have
been exceeding succesful.


In the year following, the 
Spa∣niards

quite deserted the 
Island,

except it were about 30 or 40 of


their 
Slaves,
 who betook them∣selves
to the 
Mountaines,
 but be∣ing
afraid of a Discovery, and to
be pursued to Death for some 
Mur∣thers

they had committed, built
themselves 
Conoas,
 and in them
fled to 
Cuba,
 and never since hath
any considerable attempt been
made upon them.


The 
English
 being thus become
Masters of the 
Island,
 formed them∣selves
into a Body, or Colony:
Then did they they begin to set∣tle
themselves in 
Plantations,

whilst others betook themselves
to the Sea as 
Freebooters
 or 
Pri∣vateers,

the better to secure them∣selves
against the 
Spaniards,
 and
force them to a peace by their
frequent annoying them, in seizing
such their ships which they could
meet with, which proved very
succesful unto them. And this


caused the 
Isle
 to be much talked
of, and had in esteem by the 
Eng∣lish,

who sent them supplies of
Men, Provisions, and necessaryes.
And thus by little and little it be∣came
to be so potent as now it
is.






Governours since the English
were Masters of the Island.


This Island (since the English
have been Masters of it) hath
had four Governours.


The first, Leiutenant General

Edward D'oyley,
 who before his

Majesties
 happy Restauration, was
Commander in cheif of all the

English Army
 by 
Land
 and 
Sea

in 
America.


The second, the Right Honoura∣ble

Thomas
 Lord 
Winsor,
 who is now

Lord Leiutenant
 of the County of

Worcester.



The third, Sr. 
Thomas Modyford

Baronet.


And the fourth, and present,
Sr. 
Thomas Lynch
 Knight.






Some Considerations relating to
the English Affaires in Ame∣rica,
with Reasons to justify
the first designe into the Indies.


 
Spaniards
 would never
contract a Peace with the 
English

in 
America.


 They have alwayes taken
our 
Merchants Ships
 sayling on
these 
Coasts,
 or forced them into
their 
Harbours
 by distress of 
Wea∣ther.


 In the Reign of our late 
King

(when we had Peace with them
throughout 
Europe)
 they Sacked
St. 
Christophers, Mevis, Providence,

S
ta
. 
Cruz,
 and 
Tortugas,
 murther∣ing


and carrying away most of the

Inhabitants
 into slavery; for which
they never made any repairation.


 The 
Indians,
 who are the na∣tural
proprietors of 
America,
 do a∣bominate
and hate the 
Spaniards

for their cruelty and avarice; and
upon every occasion will shew
their willingness to give themselves
and their Countreys, freely into
the power and protection of the

English.


 The pretented first discovery
cannot give them a legal power o∣ver
the genuine right of the 
Na∣tives,

nor were they the first dis∣coverers
of all those Countreys
that they pretend unto.


 The 
Popes Donation
 is of lit∣tle
validity, for he hath given them
the Crown of 
England,
 which of
the two he might more legally do,
then the 
Indies;
 for that the 
En∣glish



have been subject to his pow∣er,
the 
Indians
 never.


 Possession is not of force to
create (thought it confirms) a Right,
nor can it so alter the property, as
to make usurpation (for some time
to continue) as a legal, and just pre∣tence
of 
Dominion.


 It is against the fundamental

Lawes
 of 
Spain
 to make a peace,
and allow of a 
Trade
 into the 
In∣dies;

now there being no 
medium,
war
 must needs be justifyable
where a Peace is not allowable.


 Their barbarous cruelty in
compelling our 
Merchants,
 and o∣thers
which they have took 
prison∣ers,

to turn their 
Religion,
 and to
work at their 
Forts
 and 
Mines
 at

Mexico,
 and elsewhere, from
whence they can never return,
murthering divers, when up∣on
a 
Treaty,
 and after promise of


fair quarter, and not Exchanging
or Ransoming any, although the

English
 have freely given them
some 
hundreds
 of 
Prisoners,
 doth
sufficiently justify any attempt or
mischief we can do against them,
either in seizing on their 
Ships,
 or
the landing on their Countreys,
and the sacking, burning, or taking
their 
Towns
 and 
Countreys,
 and the
dispossessing them thereof.






Some Considerations why his Majesty
should keep, preserve, and support
this Island.


 
Jamaica
 is large, and capa∣cious,
whose extent I have already
noted; so that it is capable of re∣ceiving
very great numbers of 
Peo∣ple.


 It is seated in the heart of


the 
Spaniards American Territo∣ries;

so that the 
Spanish Shipps

coming into the 
West-Indies,
 and
sayling from 
Port
 to 
Port,
 either
make this 
Isle,
 or may be imme∣diately
met by the 
Ships
 which ply
on this 
Coast,
 which renders it to be
of great importance to Us, as well
as to the 
Spaniards:
 for all the 
Plate
Fleet
 which comes from 
Cartha∣gena,

steer directly from St. 
Do∣mingo

in 
Hispaniola,
 and from
thence must pass by one of the
Ends of this 
Isle
 to recover 
Hava∣na,

which is the common Rende∣vouze
of the 
Armado,
 before it re∣turns
home through the 
Gulph
 of

Florida.
 Nor is there any other
way whereby to miss this 
Isle,
 be∣cause
they cannot in a reasonable
time turn it up to the windward of

Hispaniola,
 which, though with great
difficulty, it might be done, yet


by this means they would loose the
security of the said united 
Fleet,

which meet at 
Havana,
 from all
parts of the Bay of 
Mexica, Nom∣bre
de dios,
 and elsewhere, and so
accompany each other home.


 
Jamaica
 is found to precede
all the 
English Plantations
 in 
Ame∣rica,

in the very 
Commodities
 that
are proper to their several 
Colonies,

and produceth also of its own 
Co∣cao,
Hydes, Tortoise-shells, Wood

for 
Dyers, Gums, Druggs,
 and o∣ther

Commodities
 already treated
of; and for 
Fruits, Fowl,
 and 
Fish,

infinite store, many of which are
unknown unto them. Likewise,
such abundance of 
Horses,
 and

Cowes,
 that none other of the 
Eng∣lish
Blantations
 can equalize them.


And as this 
Island
 is found
thus advantageous in the furnishing
us with such good 
Commodities,
 so


is it no less profitable in the taking
off our 
Manufactures,
 and 
Commo∣dities,

as well of the product of
this 
Kingdom,
 as those from 
For∣reign
parts.
 That is to say, all
sorts of 
Stuffs, Fabricks
 of 
Silks,
Linnen
 both fine and course, 
Hatts,
Gloves, Thread, Tape, Pinns,
Needles, Stockings, Shoos;
 all sorts
of 
Apparel; Wine, Brandy,
Strong-Beer;
 All sorts of 
Utensils

of 
Iron,
 and other 
Mettals
 for 
Car∣penters,
Joyners, Smiths, Coo∣pers,
Mill-Wrights,
 and other the
like 
Tradesmen,
 that are found
useful for the 
Planters
 service,
Also, 
Iron, Brass, Copper, Steel,
Lead
 and 
Tinn
 unwrought; All
sorts of 
Armes
 and 
Ammunition:

Also, Servants, and 
Negro-Slaves:

And in a word, all 
Commodities

that are necessary, and usefull ei∣ther
for the 
Back
 or 
Belly,
 are here


Vendible. And is observed, that
the better the 
Commodities
 are (e∣specially

Apparrel
 and 
Ornaments

for the Back) the sooner and bet∣ter
are they Vended.


 It appears to be a place of no
small concernment, for it hath not
only subsisted at the beginning, but
bettered its Condition, being set∣led
by an Army (the worst kind of
people to plant) that have had such
grand discouragements from 
Eng∣land,

as want of 
pay, provisions,

and 
recruits
 of 
Men;
 yet amongst
themselves talked of all encourage∣ments
to 
Plant,
 the establishment
of 
Justice
 and 
Government,
 besides,
the frequent attempts of the 
Spa∣nish
Forces;
 and if it thus thrived
under these, and such like conside∣rable
obstructions, it is more then
propable, it will in a short time be∣come
a great and profitable Colony


both to the 
King
 and 
Kingdome;

for when well planted, it may bring
into his Majesty some 
hundred thou∣sand
pownds per Annum. Barba∣does

(which is so little compared to
this) yeilding about 10000 
l. per
Annum,
 and employing about 150
or 200 Sayl of 
Ships
 yearly.


 This 
Island
 being so large
and so fertile, it is capable of the
receiving those great numbers of
people, that are forced to desert the

Caribbee Isles:
 Their 
Plantations
 be∣ing
worn out, and their 
Woods
 wa∣sted;
as likewise those multitudes
of 
Vagrants
 and 
Beggars
 that are
so great a charge and shame to the
Kingdom, if Transported thither,
(would by their labours) live both
honestly, and plentifully; here
being observed to be no beggars,
nor such loose 
Vagabond people.


 This 
Island
 being well setled,


will be capable of it self to carry on
a 
War
 against the 
Spaniards
 in the

West-Indies
 (as occasion requi∣reth)
because of the conveniences
of its 
Ports,
 and its strength of 
In∣habitants

and 
Shipping,
 having al∣ready
about 20 or 30 
Sayl
 of 
Pri∣vateers;

and will in a short time be
so numerous and potent, that they
will become so obnoxious to the

Spaniards,
 that probably they will
rather admit of a 
Trade
 into his

Ports
 (which would prove a grand
advantage both to them, and this
Kingdom) than suffer so disadvan∣tageous
a 
War.
 And having thus
forced a 
Trade,
 would gain the ac∣quaintance
of the 
Natives,
 and
learn their 
Customes,
 and method of

Trade,
 being much inclined to love
the 
English
 rather than the 
Spani∣ards.


 
Jamaica
 seems to be appro∣ved


above any of the other 
Planta∣tions,

in regard so many from all
the 
English Collonyes
 have Trans∣ported
themselves and their 
Estates

to it, who like it so well, that they
have no cause or desire to remove.


 There is now a considerable
progress made in the setling of this

Isle,
 there being upon it many

Plantations
 of 
Cocao, Sugar, In∣dico,
Cotton,
 and 
Provisions;
 and
Inhabited with many thousand of
of people. The 
Planters
 (for the
generality) now living in great de∣light,
and enjoy all things necessa∣ry
for 
Food
 and 
Rayment
 in a libe∣ral
measure; and were it well In∣habited,
it would very much con∣sume
the 
English Manufactures,

and encourage 
Navigation
 and

Merchandize.


 It cannot be imputed a dis∣advantage,
that 
Jamaica
 lyeth so


far off, for thereby are more 
Ships

employed; and by consequence,
more 
Saylors, Shipwrights, Rope∣makers,

and many other 
Trades∣men

maintained, whose dependance
is thereon. Furthermore, if it lay
not so far, we could not expect
such 
Commodities
 as it produceth,
being appropriate to the 
Clyme;

neither is it a small advantage to
have such 
Commodities
 within his

Majesties Dominions
 (though at a
distance) that are both valued and
needed by his 
Subjects
 and 
Neigh∣bours,

especially the 
Cocao.


 And lastly, to conclude,
The 
English
 have one more consi∣derable
advantage by this 
Isle,
 and
that is, the 
Coast
 of 
Virginia,
 being
subject to gusts of 
Winde,
 the 
Ships

loaden with 
Goods
 and 
Passengers,

have been often forced forth to 
Sea,

and so disabled, that they could not


ply to any of the outward 
Caribbee
Islands,
 but have been constrained
to bear up, and put into the 
Spanish
Leeward Ports;
 and likewise, some
of our 
Merchants
 have been forced
out of the 
Caribbee Isles
 by 
Hurri∣cane
's
(which are there common)
and so disabled, that they could not
keep 
Sea,
 but (as all 
Vessels
 thus
distressed) have put into some of
the 
Spanish Leeward Ports,
 where
they have alwayes, been made

Prizes.
 Now, 
Jamaica
 being
so far 
Leeward,
 is a conveni∣ent

Harbour
 for all 
Vessels
 thus
distressed; and did some few years
since save Three 
Virginia Ships

full of 
Passengers
 and 
Goods,
 and
formerly others; as also some dri∣ven
by 
Hurricanes
 from the 
Wind∣ward
Islands:
 All which, without the
conveniency, and assistance of this

Isle,
 had perished.

A
DESCRIPTION
OF
The ISLAND of
BARBADOES.


B
ARBADOES

the most con∣siderable
Co∣lony
the 
En∣glish

hath a∣mongst that
Frye of 
Isles
 called the 
Caribbee
Isles,
 or the 
Antilles.






Its Scituation.


It is seated in the North 
Lati∣tude

of 13 degrees,
 and 20 
min.

and although but of a small 
circuit,

(being accounted not above 8

Leagues
 in length, and 5 in breadth
where broadest, being of an Oval

Form)
 yet is it a potent Colony,
being able as occasion requireth, to
arm 10000 Fighting men, which,
with the strength that nature hath
bestowed on it, it is able to bid
defiance to the stoutest Foe, ha∣ving
been several times (but in
vain) assaulted by the 
Spaniards.






Its Rivers.


This 
Isle
 is not over-plentifully
watered with 
Rivers,
 or 
Fresh
Springs,
 there being but one that


may appropriate to it self that

Name,
 or rather a 
Lake,
 which
runneth not far into the 
Land;

yet notwithstanding, the 
Inhabi∣tants

are not destitute thereof,
for the Countrey lying low, and
for the most part even, there are
several 
Pools
 or 
Ponds;
 besides,
most 
Houses
 have 
Wells
 or 
Cisterns

which are always supplyed with
Rain-water.


Here is also a 
River,
 which the

Inhabitants
 call the 
Tuigh
-River,
from the top of whose 
waters
 is
gathered an 
Oyl,
 which serveth
them to burn in 
Lamps.






Its Fertility.


This 
Isle
 is exceeding Fertile,

bearing Crops all the year long,
and its 
Trees
 being always cloath∣ed
in their Summer Livery, and


the 
Fields
 and 
Woods
 in their Ver∣dure,
renders it very delightful
to the 
Inhabitants.
 But the two
principal seasons of the year for
Planting, is in 
May,
 and 
Novem∣ber,

but the 
Sugar-Canes
 are plan∣ted
all the year round, the making
of which, is not only very charge∣able,
but also as dangerous, and
subject to casualties, either in the

Boyling-house,
 with the 
Coppers

and 
Furnaces;
 in the 
Filling-room,

in the 
Still-house,
 or in the 
Cure∣ing-house.






Its Commodities.


The 
Commodities
 that this 
Isle

produceth,
 are 
Sugars,
 (which
though not so white as those of

Brazile,
 yet better when refined,
being of a fairer grain) 
Indico, Cot∣ten,
Wool, Ginger, Logwood, Fu∣stick,



and 
Lignum-vitae.
 And
these 
Commodities,
 especially 
Su∣gar,
Indico, Cotton,
 and 
Ginger,

are here in such great abundance,
that about 200 sayl of 
Ships
 and

Vessels,
 both great and small, have
yearly their loading; which after
Imported in the several Ports of

England,
 and 
Ireland,
 is again in
great quantities exported to For∣reign
parts, to our great enrich∣ment;
and the rather, for that
they are not permitted to 
Trade

with any other Nation but the 
En∣glish,

and such of his Majesties

Subjects
 in 
New-England, Virgi∣nia,

and 
Bermudoes:
 And in ex∣change
of those 
Commodities,
 they
take such as are necessary for the
use of man, as well for the 
Back

and 
Belly,
 as for their 
Houses,
 and

Plantations;
 with many of which,
they are supplyed from 
New-Eng∣land,


Virginia,
 and the 
Bermu∣does;

together with 
Servants,
 and

Slaves,
 as I have noted at the lat∣ter
end of the description of 
Ja∣maica,

about 
page
 73. together
with several sorts of 
Commodities

and 
Provisions,
 which 
Jamaica

hath no occasion of, as 
Horses, Ca∣mels,
Assinegroes, Cattel;
 also
salted 
Flesh
 and 
Fish
 of several
sorts; 
Butter
 and 
Cheese;
 but by
reason of the great heat of the wea∣ther,
it will soon stink, and be∣come
unfit to eat; so that instead
of 
Butter,
 they make great use of

Oyl
 for their Sauces.


The 
Dayes
 and 
Nights
 are al∣most
thorowout the 
Year,
 of an e∣qual
length, the Sun Rising and
Setting at 6. except about 
October,

and then there is some small dif∣ference.








The Temperature of Air.


This 
Isle
 is very 
hott,
 especially
for 8 
months,
 yet not so, but that
Travel, and Labour is sufferable;
but were it not for the cool 
breezes

of 
Winde
 which Riseth with the

Sun,
 and bloweth fresher as the
Sun mounteth up, it would be un∣sufferable.
And these 
Bree∣zes

always blow from 
North-East,

and by 
East,
 unless it be in the
time of the 
Turnado,
 and then for
a few hours it chopps into the

South,
 but returns to the same point
again. And it is observed, that
although the people do so much
sweat, yet they have not that faint∣ness
as with us, in the months of

July
 and 
August;
 neither are they
so thirsty, without occasioned by
excess of 
Labour,
 or 
Drinking
 of


strong 
Liquors,
 which the 
People

are here too much addicted unto,
to their great hurt, which if mode∣rately
taken, would be as great a
preservative to comfort their in∣ward
parts, which are left cold,
and faint, through their sweating.
Besides, our bodies being accusto∣med
to colder 
Climates,
 our spi∣rits
are not so vigorous without
them in a moderate manner.


The 
Air,
 though hot, is very
moist, which causeth all 
Iron-tools,

as 
Knives, Swords, Locks, Keys,

&c. to rust, so that without con∣stant
usage, they will soon become
eaten up with rust. And this great

heat
 and 
moisture,
 doth cause the

Plants
 and 
Trees
 to grow so large,
and high.








Their Fruits.


Here are abundance of 
Fruits

of several sorts,
 
as Dates, Orenges

of two sorts, the one sweet, and
the other sharp, 
Pomgranates, Ci∣trons,
Limes, Lemons, Macows,
Grapes, Juneper-Apples, Papay∣ers,
Momins, Monbains, Acajous,
Icacos, Cherries, Raysins, Indian
Figgs, Cocos, Plantins, Bonanoes,
Guavers, Prickle-Apples, Pric∣kle-Pears,
Custard-Apples, Mil∣lons,

both land and water, and

Pine-Apples,
 the rarest Fruit in
the 
Indies.






Their Fish.


Here are great store of 
Fish
 in
the 
Sea,
 as 
Snappers, Crabs, Lob∣sters,
Terbums, Macquerels, Mul∣lots,


Cavallos, Parrat-Fish, Co∣ny-Fish,

and 
green Turtles,
 which
of all others are the most delicious,
with several other sorts appropri∣ated
to this and the rest of the 
Ca∣ribbee
Isles.
 But the 
Rivulets,
 or

Ponds,
 have few or no 
Fish
 in
them.






Their Beasts.


Here are no 
Beasts
 or 
Cattel
 but
what are Tame,
 and brought them;
as Camels, Horses, Assinegroes,
Oxen, Bulls, Cowes, Sheep, and
Goats, and Hoggs, which are here
in great plenty in every 
Plantati∣on,

it being their common food,
whose Flesh is esteemed very good
and delicious; but as for 
Beef,
 and

Mutton,
 it is very dear, as having
but a small stock, but might be
soon encreased, would they spare


ground enough for Pasturage for
them from their other occasions.






Their Herbs and Roots.


Here groweth divers sorts of

English hearbs,
 
and
 roots, 
as
 Rose∣mary,
Lavender, Lavender-Cot∣ton,
Mar
erom, Winter-Savory,
Time, Parsley, Tansey, Sage, Pur∣celane,

&c. and for
 Roots, Caba∣ges,
Colworths, Collyflowers, Tur∣nips,
Potatoes, Onyons, Garlick,
Radishes, Lettice, Taragon, Ma∣rigolds,

&c.






Their Birds and Fowles.


Here are several sorts of
 Fowles,


as
 Turkeys, Hens, Muscovy-ducks,
Pigeons, Turtle-Doves, 
&c. and
for small
 Birds, 
great variety; as

Thrushes, Black-birds, Sparrows,

&c.








Their Insects and Animals.


Here are several 
Animals,
 and

Insects,
 as 
Snakes
 a yard and a half
long, 
Scorpions
 as big as Rats, but
no wayes hurtful to man or beast;

Lizzards,
 which are exceeding
harmless, much frequenting the
houses, and loving the company
of men; 
Musketoes, Cockroches,

and 
Merriwings,
 which are very
troublesome in the night in sting∣ing;
also, here are 
land-Crabs
 in
great abundance, which are found
good to eat. And here is a small
Fly which they call 
Cayouyou,

whose 
Wings
 in the Night, as it
flyeth, casts forth a great lustre,
and the 
Indians
 do commonly
catch them, and tye them to their
hands or feet, and make use of
them instead of a 
Candle,
 which
is forbidden them.








Their Trees.


Here are great variety of 
Trees.

fit for several uses, as the 
Locust,
Mastick, Red-wood,
 the 
prickled-Yellow-wood,

the 
Ironwood-Tree,

and the 
Cedar
 Tree, which are fit
for building. Also, the 
Cassia,
Fistula, Coloquintida, Tamarine,
Cassavie,
 of which is made their
bread; the 
Poyson-Tree,
 and the

Phisick-Nut,
 these have a 
Phy∣sical,

and some a 
poysonous Ver∣tue

in them. Also, here are these

Trees
 following, the 
Calibash,
 the

Shell
 of whose 
Fruit,
 serveth to
carry liquid things in, being of the
nature of 
Goards;
 the 
Mangrass-Tree,

which is of an exceeding
greatness; the 
Roucou,
 of whose 
bark

is made 
Ropes,
 as also 
Flax,
 which
being spun, is employed to seve∣ral


uses; the 
Lignum-vitae,
 the

Palmeto,
 which is very large, and
beautiful to behold; with several
others.






Several Caves.


In this 
Island
 are divers 
Caves,

some of which are very deep, and
large enough to hold 500 
men;

and these 
Caves
 are often the
Sanctuaries of such 
Negro-slaves

that run away, in which they oft∣times
lie a good while ere found
out, seldome stirring in the day∣time,
although they are such un∣wholesome
places, by reason of
the great damps that are found in
them. And it is supposed, that
these 
Caves
 were the 
Habitations

of the 
Natives.








Its Division and Towns.


This 
Island
 is severed into Ele∣ven

Precincts,
 or 
Parishes,
 in which
are 14 
Churches
 and 
Chappels,
 and
here are many places which may
not unaptly be called 
Townes,
 as
being composed of a long and spa∣cious
Street, which are beautified
with fair houses; and indeed the
whole 
Isle
 for these many years,
is so taken up with 
Planters
 (there
being no wast ground to be found)
that it is thorowout beset with 
Hou∣ses,

at no great distance from one
another.






Its chief Townes.


1.
 St. 
Michaels
 formerly called
the 
Bridg-Town,
 or 
Indian-Bridg,

scituate at the bottome of 
Carlisle-Bay



in the 
Leeward,
 or Southern
part of the 
Isle,
 which 
Bay
 is very
capacious, deep, and secure for

Ships,
 being large enough to en∣tertain
500 
Vessels
 at one time,
The 
Town
 is long, containing se∣veral

Streets,
 and graced with a∣bundance
of well-built houses. It
is very populous, being the Resi∣dence
of the 
Governour,
 or his

Deputy,
 the place of 
Judicature,

and the 
Scale
 of 
Trade,
 where
most of the 
Merchants,
 and 
Fact∣tors

in the 
Isle
 have their 
Storehou∣ses

for the negotiation of their 
Af∣fairs;

and from these 
Storehouses

or 
Shops,
 the 
Inhabitants
 are sup∣plyed
with such 
Commodities
 as
they have occasion of, in exchange
of theirs, which are the product of
of the 
Isle.
 The Town is ill seat∣ed,
the ground being lower than
the banks of the 
Sea,
 by which


means the Spring-
Tides
 doth flow
over, and there remaining, doth
make a kind of of a moorish bogg,
which doth occasion it to be more
unhealthful than the other parts
of the 
Isle.
 This Town for its
defence, and security of the 
Ships,

hath two strong Forts opposite to
each other, with a 
Platform
 in the
midst, which also commands the

Road,
 all which are well Fortify∣ed
with great Guns, &c. The
principal of these 
Forts
 is called

Charles Fort,
 being seated on 
Ned∣hams
Point.


2.
 
Little Bristol,
 formerly

Sprights Bay,
 scituate about four

Leagues
 Leeward from St. 
Micha∣els,

hath a commodious Road for

Ships,
 is a place well frequented,
and traded unto, and is strong∣ly
Defended by two powerful

Forts.



3. St. 
James,
 formerly called
the 
Hall,
 seated not far from 
Bri∣stol,

hath the accommodation of
a good Road for 
Ships,
 and is a
place of a considerable 
Trade,
 for
its defence, besides a large 
Plat∣form,

hath fortified 
Breast-works;

and in this 
Town
 is kept for the
Precinct, the monthly 
Courts.


4.
 
Charles-Town,
 seated winde∣ward
of St. 
Michaels,
 about two

Leagues:
 And on 
Oyster-Bay,
 it is
secured by two strong 
Forts,
 the
one to the Windward, and the o∣ther
to the Leeward, of the 
Town

and 
Road,
 with a 
Platform
 in the
midst. This 
Town
 hath the acco∣modation
of weekly 
Markets,
 and
here is kept the monthly 
Courts
 for
the 
Precinct.


The other 
Parishes
 are of less
note.








Other Places on the Sea-Coast.


Other Places of Name along
the Sea-Coast of this 
Isle,
 begin∣ing
Easterly, and so encompassing
the 
Isle,
 are as followeth:


Fowl-Bay, Austins-Bay, Max∣wells-Bay,

where there is a small
Isle,
 Blackrock, 
The
 Hole, Spikes-Bay,
Balises-Bay, Long-Bay, Clarks-Bay,

and
 Constance-Bay.






The Inhabitants.


The 
Inhabitants
 of this 
Isle
 may
be Ranged under 3 heads or sorts,

to witt, Masters, (which are 
En∣glish,
Scotch,
 and 
Irish,
 with some
few 
Dutch, French,
 and 
Jews) Chri∣stian
Servants,
 and 
Negro-Slaves.

And these three sorts are excee∣ding
numerous; for, according to


a Calculation not long since made,
the 
Masters,
 and 
Servants,
 did a∣mount
to about 50000, and the

Negroes
 to about double the num∣ber.


The 
Masters,
 for the most part,
live at the height of Pleasure


The 
Servants,
 at the expirati∣on
of 5 years, become Freemen
of the 
Island,
 and employ their
times according to their 
abilities,

and 
capacities;
 either to get a small

Plantation,
 or to 
work
 at day-la∣bour
in other 
Plantations,
 or else
to exercise their 
Trades,
 if so capa∣citated.


The 
Negro-Slaves
 are never
out of their 
Bondage,
 and the 
Chil∣dren

they get, are likewise perpe∣tual

Slaves.
 They have but mean
allowance of 
dyet, cloaths,
 and 
lod∣ging;

and although held to such
hard Labour, and so ill treated,


yet are they well contented with
their Conditions; and if their

Master
 is but any thing kind, they
think nothing too much to be done
for them; and therefore 'tis great
pity to wrong such poor 
Creatures.


The chiefest 
Stock
 of a 
Planter,

consists in his 
Servants
 and 
Slaves,

but especially the 
Slaves,
 who are
more numerous. And these they
Buy on 
Shipboard,
 as men Buy
Horses in a 
Fayr,
 and according as
they are handsome, lusty, well-shapen,
and young, either the 
men

or 
women,
 they give more or less;
the general Rates for the Christi∣an-servants
being about 10 
l.
 but
if one that hath a good Trade, as a

Carpenter, Joyner, Smith,
 or the
like, then far more: Likewise,
a Female that is young and
handsome, is highe
 valued. The
general Rate for the better sort of



Negro
-men, is 20 
l.
 or 25 
sl.
 ster∣ling;
and for 
Women,
 about 15 
l.

for the encrease of stock of 
Ne∣groes,

they generally take as ma∣ny

Men
 as 
Women.






The Maintenance of the Servants
and Slaves.


The Maintenance of the 
Ser∣vants,

and 
Negro-Slaves,
 as to
their Dyet, Apparrel, and Lodg∣ing,
is very inconsiderable.


For their 
Food,
 they are con∣tented
from weeks-end, to weeks-end,
with 
Potatoes, Loblolly,
 made
of beaten 
Maize
 mixt with water;

Cassader-bread
 common in all the

Indies, Bonavist,
 and such like
food that the 
Plantation
 affordeth;
as for 
Meat,
 they are seldome
troubled with it, except at 
Christ∣mas,
Easter,
 and 
Whitsontide,
 and


they have 
Hoggs-flesh,
 according
to the custome of the 
Island;
 but
of late, the servants are allowed
weekly, a small quantity of 
Swines-Flesh,

or salted 
Flesh,
 or 
Fish;
 and
when any of the 
Cattle
 dye of any
distemper, or by accident, it is
given to the 
Negroes,
 who feed
like Princes on it.


Their 
Drinks
 are 
Mobbie,
 made
of 
Potatoes
 soaked in water; 
Perino,

made of 
Casavie-Root
 and water;

Crippo, Kill-Devil, Punch,
 made
of water and Sugar; 
Plantin-drink,

made of 
Plantins
 and water; 
Be∣veridge,

made of Spring-water, 
Su∣gar,

and the juyce of 
Orenges;
 and

wine
 of 
Pines,
 which is only made
of the juyce of the 
Fruit,
 which is
exceeding good and delicious; but
this sort, as also the 
Beveridge,
 and

Punch,
 the servants are not much
troubled with.



But as for the 
Master-Planters,
Merchants, Factors,
 and 
Stran∣gers,

their Faire is far otherwise,
having their curious-made 
Dishes,

as 
Custards, Cheese-cakes, Tansies;

also, 
Sturgeon, Anchoves, Caviare,
Botardo, Neates-Tongues,
 besides

Poultrey, Fish, Fowl, Mutton, Beef,
Kid, Porke, Beans, Pease,
 seve∣ral

Roots,
 and other good 
Dishes.

And, besides the several sorts of

Liquors
 already named, 
Wines,
Strong waters, Brandy,
 and 
Eng∣lish-Beer;

so that they find no want,
and do not consider the condition
of those poor wretches, their 
Ser∣vants

and 
Slaves,
 who are con∣strained
to so hard a labour.


The 
Apparrel
 they allow their

Servants
 yearly,
 for the men, are
6 pair of 
Drawers,
 12 pair of 
Shoos,

3 
Monmouth-Caps, 6 Shirts;
 and
for the women, 4 
Smocks, 3 Petti∣coats,



4 
Coifes,
 and 12 paire of

Shoos,
 besides, a Rug-Gown to
each, to keep them warm, in the
night, and to put on them when
they come sweating from their la∣bour.
To the 
Negro-men,
 they
allow but 3 pair of 
Canvas-Draw∣ers,

and to the 
Women,
 but three

Petticoats.


But for themselves (especially
the better sort) they are exceeding
profuse and costly.


The 
Lodging
 of these poor
wretches is worst of all,
 for ha∣ving
laboured all the day in so hot
a 
Countrey,
 without any nourish∣ing

Dyet,
 at night they must be
contented to lye hard, on nothing
but a 
board,
 without any 
Coverled,

in their 
Hutts,
 or rather 
Hogsties;

but Christian 
Servants
 are some∣thing
better Treated, being allow∣ed

Hamocks.



Every 
Sunday,
 (which is the
only day of Rest, and should be
set apart for the service of God)
they employ either in the getting
of the Bark of 
Trees,
 and making
of 
Ropes
 with it, which they Truck
away for 
Shirts, Drawers,
 and the
like; or else spend the day in Re∣creation,
as 
Dancing,
 and 
Wrest∣ling,

which they much delight in,
though they are no great Profi∣cients
in either; for in their 
Dan∣cing,

they use antick actions, their
hands having more of motion than
their feet; and their head, than ei∣ther;
nor do the men and women

Dance
 together, but apart; the

Musique
 to which they 
Dance,
 be∣ing
a sort of 
Kettle-drums,
 one big∣ger
than another, which makes a
strange and various noise, but whi∣ther
Harmonious, I leave to the
judgment of the Reader.



It is thought by many, that the

Christians
 should be in danger of
being murthered by the 
Negro-Slaves,

who so much over-top
them in number, and the rather,
for that they are so cruelly used,
and for that reason, many are fear∣ful
to venture to dwell here. But
this Objection may be thus an∣swered;
that first, they are such
as were brought from several parts
of 
Africa,
 and do not understand
one anothers Language; and then
they are stir'd up with an inb-read
hatred against one another, it be∣ing
the custome in those parts, for
several petty 
Kings
 to go to Wars
against one another; and the 
Pri∣soners

that are taken of each side,
they sell unto us, and other 
Euro∣pean
Nations
 that come to 
Traf∣fique

with them; also, they are not
permitted to touch, nay, hardly to


see a 
Gun,
 or any other 
weapon;
 and
being kept in such a 
slavery,
 they
are fearful of begining such an In∣surrection,
it being present death
for any that shall in the least be
found to act, or contrive such a
thing.


The 
Management
 of a 
Plantati∣on,

ought to be the 
Masters
 care,
yet few of them (except those of
the meaner degree) are without
their 
Overseers,
 who takes off that
trouble from them, whose Office
is to call them to work by the Ring
of a 
Bell,
 at 6 a clock in the mor∣ning,
to appoint them their seve∣sal
works, to give them due Cor∣rection
upon any Misdemeanour, or
Idleness; he likewise dismisses them
at 11 a clock, to go to their Din∣ner,
and calls them again by One a
clock by the said Bell, and dischar∣geth
them at 6 at night.



What I have said in this Trea∣tise
of 
Barbadoes
 concerning their

Servants,
 and 
Slaves,
 may be said
in that of 
Jamaica;
 for the 
Ser∣vants,

and 
Slaves,
 are their grea∣test
stock; those they Buy, the

Servants
 for a Tearm of years, the

Negroes
 for ever; their 
Apparrel

which they allow to either being
much the same, but their Dyet
better; and for their labour, it may
be said to be much the same, the

Island
 producing the same 
Commo∣dities.






The Island of Barbados very strong.


This 
Island
 is very strong,
 as
well by 
Nature
 as 
Art,
 being shel∣tered
with 
Rocks,
 and 
Shoals;
 and
where nature hath not thus defen∣ded
it, it is Fortified by 
Trenches

and 
Rampiers,
 with 
Pallisadoes,


Curtains,
 and 
Counter-Scarfes;
 be∣sides,
round about the 
Isle,
 re∣guarding
the 
Sea,
 is standing-
Wood:

Here are also, for its fur∣ther
Defence, 3 
Forts,
 one for a

Magazine
 for the 
Ammunition,
 and

Powder
 to lye in, and the other
two for places of 
Retreats,
 as occa∣sion
serveth. They have also for
their further security, a standing

Militia,
 consisting of two 
Regi∣ments

of 
Horse,
 and five of 
Foot,

which are Stout, and well-Disci∣plined
men, and alwayes to be
Ready on beat of Drum.






The Government of this Isle.


This 
Isle
 is Governed by 
Lawes

assimulated to those of 
England,

for all matters either 
Civil, Eccle∣siastick,
Criminal, Maritine,
 or

Martial;
 yet not without some
few 
Lawes
 appropriate to them∣selves,
which are not repugnant


to the 
Lawes
 of 
England.


For the Execution of these

Lawes,
 they have their 
Courts
 of

Judicature.


The 
Law
 is administred by the

Governour,
 or his 
Deputy,
 and
Ten of his 
Council.


The 
Isle
 is divided into four 
Cir∣cuites,

in each of which, there is
an Inferiour 
Court
 for civil 
Causes,

from which, Appeals may be made
to the 
Supream Court.


Here are also 
Justices
 of the

Peace, Constables, Church-war∣dens,

and 
Tything-men.


And for the 
Administration
 of

Justice,
 here are yearly 5 
Sessions.


At the 
Governours
 pleasure, he
calleth an Assembly for the ma∣king
of New 
Lawes,
 (so, as not
contrary to those of 
England)

and for the abolishing of Old;
which said 
Assembly
 is much in the


nature of our 
Parliament,
 and
doth consist of the 
Governour
 as

Supream,
 his Ten Council as so
many 
Peers,
 and two 
Burgesses,

chosen by the Commonalty out of
each of the 
Parishes.


The present Governour is the
Right Hon.
 
William Willoughby,

Baron 
Willoughby
 of 
Parham.


As concerning the nature of
the 
Sugar-Canes,
 how to 
Plant

them, their 
growth, cutting, grind∣ing,
boyling;
 the 
conveyance
 of the

Skimmings
 into the 
Cisterns,
 how
to 
distill
 it for 
Spirits;
 how long it
stayes in the 
Cureing-house,
 before
it be good 
Muscovado-Sugar;
 to∣gether
with the making it into

Whites,
 is not my business in this
small 
Treatise,
 to give the Reader
instructions therein,
 referring to
Mr. 
Richard Ligons
 Book of the
Description of this 
Isle.










A
DESCRIPTION
OF
The ISLAND of
St. CHRISTOPHERS.


ST. 
Christophers,
 so called
from 
Christopher Columbus,

the first discoverers thereof,
scituate in the 
Latitude
 of 17
degrees, and 25 
min.
 in circuite,
about 75 
miles:
 The Land lieth
high and mountainous in the midst,
from which springeth several 
Ri∣vers,



which oft-times, by reason
of the 
Raines
 that falleth down the

Mountaines,
 are overflown to the
detriment of the 
Inhabitants.




The Soyl, Commodities, &c.


The 
Soyl
 is light and sandy,
 and
very apt to produce several sorts
of 
Fruits, Provisions,
 and 
Commo∣dities;

as 
Sugar, Tobacco, Cot∣ton,
Ginger,
 &c.


This 
Isle,
 by reason of its several
great and steepy 
Mountains,
 be∣tween
which, are Springs of hot, and
Sulphurous 
Water,
 with horrid

Precipices,
 and thick 
Woods,
 ren∣ders
it very impassable through the
midst: And the steepy 
Ascents
 of
the 
Mountains,
 are divided into
several 
Stages,
 or 
Stories,
 where
are spacious wayes.



On the 
Sea-side
 there is a 
Salt-pit

called 
Gul-desac,
 and not far from
the said 
Salt-pit,
 there is a small

Istmus
 of land, which reacheth
within a mile and a half of the 
I∣sland

of 
Nievis,
 or 
Mevis.


This 
Island
 is a place exceeding
delightful,
 and of a most delecta∣ble
Prospect to the Eye of the be∣holder;
for if the Eye be directed
downwards, from the top, it hath
a Prospect of curious 
Gardens,

which gently descend to the Sea∣side;
and in reguard of the conti∣nual
Ascent of the 
Isle,
 the lower

Stage
 or 
Story,
 doth not debar the

Eye
 of the pleasant Prospect of
that which lyeth at a Remoter di∣stance,
which is terminated by
those high 
Mountains:
 And that
which maketh the Prospect the
more delectable in the several

Plantations
 (which are bounded


with Rows of 
Trees
 alwayes in
their Verdure) are the fair 
Houses

covered with glazed Slate.






The Division of the Isle, and how
Possessed.


The whole 
Isle
 is divided into
four 
Quarters
 or 
Cantons,
 two of
which, are possessed by the 
Eng∣lish,

and two by the 
French;
 which
parts are not so well watered, as
those of the 
English,
 but are bet∣ter
for 
Tillage,
 and not so 
Hilly.


The 
English
 are more Popu∣lous
then the 
French,
 and have
two fortified places, one comman∣ding
the great 
Haven,
 and the o∣ther
a descent not far from 
Pointe
de sable.


The 
French
 have Four strong

Forts,
 of which one hath 
Regular
Works
 like a 
Cittadel,
 that of most


note commands the 
Haven,
 and
is called 
Basse-Terre.


Both the 
English,
 and the 
French,

keep constant Guard at their 
Forts,

placed at the entrance of the 
Paths

which leads to the several 
Wards,

for the better security of each o∣ther.


Here are five 
Churches
 in those
parts belonging to the 
English,
 viz.
one at 
Sandy-point,
 one at 
Palme-Tree,

another near the great Road,
and two at the Inlet of 
Cayoune,

with many fair Structures.


The 
French,
 besides their seve∣ral

Habitations,
 dispersed up and
down in their 
quarters,
 have at

Basse-Terre
 (near the 
Haven
 where

Ships
 lye at 
Anchor)
 a 
Town
 of a
good bigness,
 whose 
Houses
 are
well 
built,
 of 
Brick, Freestone,

and 
Timber;
 where the 
Merchants

have their 
Store-houses,
 and is well


Inhabited by 
Tradesmen,
 and are
well served with such 
Commodities,

both for the 
Back,
 and 
Belly,
 toge∣ther
with 
Utensils
 for their 
Houses,

and 
Plantations,
 as they have occa∣sion
of, in exchange of such 
Commo∣dities

which are the product of the

Island.
 Here is a fair, and large

Church,
 as also a 
publique-Hall,
 for
the administration of 
Justice:
 Here
is also a very fair 
Hospital,
 built by
the 
General,
 for such people that
cannot get cure at their 
Houses;

where they are well maintained and
attended by 
Doctors,
 and 
Physiti∣ans,

for the recovery of their
Healths. Here is also a stately 
Ca∣stle,

being the Residence of the 
Go∣vernour,

most pleasantly seated, at
the foot of a high 
Mountain,
 not far
from the 
Sea,
 having spacious

Courts,
 delightful 
Walks,
 and 
Gar∣dens,

and enjoyeth a curious pro∣spect.










A

OF
The ISLAND of
NIEVIS, or MEVIS.


THe Island of

minutes.


It is but small,
 being not above
Eighteen miles in Circuite.



There is but One 
Mountain

in the

 and that is seated
in the midst, which is of a great
height, but of an easy Access,
and cloathed with 
Trees
 from
its Somett to the bottom; and
about this Mountain, are the

Plantations
 which reach to the

Sea-Shore.




Springs of Water.


Here are divers 
Springs
 of

Fresh-Water,
 and one Spring of
a 
Hott
 and 
Mineral Water;
 not
far from whose Spring-head are

Baths
 made, which are much
frequented for the curing of
several distempers of the Body of
man.


It is indifferent Fertile, and

Game for 
Hunting.



The 
Isle
 is Inhabited by a∣bout
three or four Thousand,
who live well, and drive a 
Trade

for such things as they have oc∣casion
for, by exchanging such

Commodities
 as the 
Isle
 produ∣ceth;
as, 
Sugar, Cotton, Ginger,
Tobacco,
 &c.


It is a well-Governed 
Colony,

where Justice is duly administred,
and all Vices severely punish∣ed.


For the Worship of God,

here are three 
Churches;
 and
for its further defence, and safe∣ty,
it hath a 
Fort,
 whereon are
mounted several Peeces, for the
security of the 
Ships
 in the
Road, or Harbour, called 
Bath-Bay,

as also the the publique-
Store-house.


This 
Isle,
 as the rest of the

Caribbee

It is of a difficult access, and


very dangerous for 
Shipping,
 by
reason of the Rocks which encom∣pass
it.


It hath some few 
Springs
 of

Fresh-water,
 besides which, the

Inhabitants,
 which are about 8 or
900. have made several 
Cisterns,

and 
Ponds,
 for the preserving of

Rain-Water.

Ships.



It is very 
Montainous,
 yet not
without many Fertile 
Valleys,

producing several 
Commodities,

but chiefly 
Tobacco,
 which is plan∣ted
by the 
English;
 but the 
Na∣tives

which are 
Canibals,
 and ve∣ry
Barbarous, doth much hinder
the comming of the 
English
 to
settle here.








A
DESCRIPTION

it found to be of a Fertile Soyl,
and to be well stored with 
Cattle,
Sheep,
 &c. and may produce se∣veral
good 
Commodities,
 were it

of the 
Inhabitants.








A
DESCRIPTION
OF
The ISLES of
BERMƲDES,
OR,
The Summer-ISLES.


EAst
 of 
Virginia,
 and 
Caroli∣na,

which is a part of 
Flo∣rida,

lyeth the Isles of 
Ber∣mudes;

so called, from

John Bermudes
 a 
Spaniard,
 by


whom they were first discovered.
They are also called the 
Summer-Isles,

from the 
Shipwrack
 that one

George Summers
 (an 
English
-man)
there suffered.


These 
Isles
 lye distant from 
En∣gland,

about 15 or 1600 
Leagues,

from 
Madera,
 1000, or 1200;
from 
Hispaniola,
 400; and from

Carolina,
 which is the neerest part
of Land, about 300 
Leagues.




Their Extent.


Of these 
Isles,
 the greatest cal∣led
St. 
Georges,
 is 5 or 6 Leagues
long, and almost thorowout, not
above a quarter, a third, or half a
League broad, the others are
much less.






Their Form, &c.


All these 
Isles
 together, form a


body like a 
Cressent,
 and inclose
very good 
Ports,
 the chief among
which, are those of the 
Great-Sound,
Herringtons Inlet, South∣hampton,

and 
Pagets;
 which, with
their 
Forts
 of 
Dover,
 and 
Warwick,

take their names from the several
Noble men that were concerned
as undertakers.






The Fertility, Commodities,
Fruits, &c.


The 
Earth
 is exceeding Fertile,

yeilding two Crops yearly; their

Maize
 they gather in 
July,
 and

December.


They have excellent 
Fruits,
 as,

Oranges, Dates, Mulberries
 both
White and Red; where breed a∣bundance
of 
Silk-worms
 which spin

Silk.


Their chief 
Commodities
 are, 
O∣Oranges,


Couchaneil,
 and 
Tobacco,

with some 
Pearl,
 and 
Amber∣greece,

and with these they drive
some small 
Trade.


They have plenty of 
Tortoises,

which is their ordinary food, whose

Flesh
 is very delicious.


Their 
Hoggs,
 which the 
Spani∣ards

formerly carried thither, are
greatly encreased.


They have many 
Fowles,
 and

Birds,
 amongst which, a great ma∣ny

Cranes,
 with a 
Sea-Fowl
 that
breeds in holes like 
Rabbets.


They have no 
Fresh-Water
 for
their occasions,
 but that of 
Wells,

and 
Pits,
 which 
Ebbs
 and 
Flowes

with the 
Sea,
 there being neither

Fountain
 nor 
Stream
 in these 
Isles.






No Venemous Beast.


In these 
Isles
 are no 
Venemous


beast,
 their 
Spiders
 are not poy∣sonous,
but are of sundry and va∣rious

Colours;
 and in the hot wea∣ther,
they make their 
Webs
 so
strong, that oft-times the small

Birds
 are entangled and catched in
them.






Caedar Trees.


Here are 
Caedar Trees,
 which
differs from all others in several re∣spects,
but the wood is very sweet.






The Air and Healthfulness.


The 
Skie
 is almost always Se∣rene,

and when darkned with

clouds,
 it commonly 
Thunders,
 and

Lightneth:
 And the 
Air
 is very
Temperate, and so exceeding
healthful, that it is rare to hear
that any one dyeth of any Distem∣per,


but only Old age; insomuch
that many have removed from 
En¦gland

hither, only for the enjoy¦ment
of a long, and healthful life▪
And those that have made any long
continuance here, are fearful o

removing out of so pure an 
Air.






The Inhabitants.


The 
English
 first setled them∣selves
on these 
Isles
 about the year
1612.
 and have now established
a powerful 
Colony,
 there being at
present, about four or five Thou∣sand

Inhabitants,
 who have strong∣ly
Fortified the 
Approaches,
 which
with the 
Rocks
 in the 
Sea,
 renders
them Impregnable.

A
DESCRIPTION
OF
CAROLINA.


CAROLINA,
 a New esta∣blished

Colony,
 of the 
Eng∣lish,

being that part of 
Flo∣rida

adjoyning to 
Virginia,

which makes its Northern bounds
in the 
Latitude
 of 36 degrees; and
extendeth it self to the 
Latitude
 of
29, which makes its extream Sou∣thern
bounds; on the East it is
washed with the 
Atlantick Ocean,



and on the West, it hath that large
Tract of land which runneth into
the 
Pacifique Ocean.




Its Temperature, and Healthfulness.


It is a 
Countrey
 blest with a
Temperate,
 and Wholesome 
Air,

the 
heat
 in 
Summer,
 nor the 
Cold
 in

Winter,
 (which is not so much as to
check the growth of Plants, Trees,
&c. The several Fruits, and
Plants, having their distinct seasons,
being no wayes offensive to the

Inhabitants.
 Neither is the 
Air

thus Temperate, and Agreeable,
to the 
Natives
 only, but it is as
Favourable to the 
English:
 And
being thus healthful, hath Invited
several persons from the 
Bermu∣des

to settle here; who dwelling
in so pure an 
Air,
 durst not ven∣ture
in any other 
Countrey.
 Nor


do those from the 
Bermudes

only remove hither, upon the as∣surance
of a happy life, joyned
with the gaining of Fair 
Estates,

but also, many 
English
 from most
of the 
American Plantations,
 it
being generally esteemed one of
the best 
Colonies
 that ever the 
En∣glish

were Masters of; for here is

Health, Pleasure,
 and 
Profit
 to be
found, which cannot be met with
in so large a measure, in any 
Coun∣trey

of the 
Indies.






Their Fruits, Hearbs, &c.


The 
Soyl
 is Rich,
 and Fertile,
and produceth excellent 
Fruits;

as 
Apricocks, Peaches, Grapes,

(of which the 
English
 have made
good 
Wine) Olives, Walnuts,
Apples, Pears, Plumbs, Cherries,
Figgs, Mulberries, Strawberries,


Water-Mellons, Marachocks, Quin∣ces,

and other 
Fruits
 known to us
in 
Europe,
 which for goodness are
no wayes Inferiour to them; and
in the Southern part, 
Oranges,
Limes, Pomgranates,
 and 
Pome-Citrons.

And indeed, the Earth
is very apt to produce, and bring
to Maturity, 
Corn,
 all sorts of 
Gar∣den-Herbs,

and 
Roots,
 &c.






Its Commodities.


The 
Commodities
 which this

Countrey
 doth,
 and may produce,
are 
Wines, Oyls, Silk, (Mulberry-Trees

growing in great abundance
in the 
Woods) Cotton, Indico, Gin∣ger,
Tobacco,
 &c. And it is be∣lieved,
that here may be made of
the three first 
Commodities,
 viz.

Wines, Oyl,
 and 
Silk,
 such great
abundance, to theirs, and this



Kingdoms
 enrichment, that be∣sides
what we shall use our selves,
we may have wherewith to furnish

Forrain Parts.






Their Trees.


Besides the 
Mulberry-Trees,

here are those of 
Caedar, Oak,
 both
White and Red, 
Poplar, Bay,
Ash,
 and 
Pine;
 with several others
whose names are yet unknown.






Their Rivers, Fish, and Fowl.


The 
Countrey
 is very well wa∣tered
with 
Rivers,
 there being
between 
Cape-Carteret,
 and 
Port-Rasal,

which is not above 60 
miles,

5 or 6 great Navigable 
Rivers,

which discharge themselves into
the 
Sea,
 besides several others of
less Remark. And these 
Rivers
 are


plentifully stored with excellent

Fish
 of sundry sorts, which being
the same as are found in 
Virginia,

which comes next to be treated of,
I shall omit the nameing of them
here.


Here are also great plenty of

Wild-Fowl,
 as 
Geese, Cranes,
Swans, Herons, Curlews, Heath-Cocks,
Oxeys, Brants, Dotterels,
Widgeons, Teals,
 and 
Duck,
 and

Mallard
 in an undestroyable quan∣tity.






Provisions in the Woods.


The 
Woods
 are well stored with
large 
Turkeys, Phesants, Partrid∣ges,
Turtle-Doves, Wood-Pidgeons,

with great variety and plenty of
small 
Birds.
 Also in the 
Woods,

are great plenty of 
Deer,
 with abun∣dance
of 
Hares, Coneys,
 &c.



Here are divers delightful, and
spacious 
Savanas.






The Natives of Carolina.


The 
Natives
 of 
Carolina,
 accor∣ding
to the observation of Mr.

John Ledener
 (who made three
several journeys from 
Virginia,
 to

Carolina,
 about the year 1670.
on purpose for a discovery of those
parts, and the better understand∣ing
the nature and disposition of
the 
Inhabitants)
 are said by him,
to be a people of a ready witt, and
though Illiterate, of a good under∣standing.
For the 
Account
 of 
time,

(he saith,) they make use of 
Hiero∣glyphicks,

and 
Emblems
 of 
things;

likewise they instruct their 
Chil∣dren

in such things as relates to
their 
Families
 and 
Countrey,
 which
is so preserved from 
Generation,
 to



Generation;
 where a battle hath
been fought, or upon the settle∣ment
of a 
Colony,
 they raise a small

Pyramid
 of stone, which doth con∣sist
of the number 
slain,
 or setled
at such a 
Colony.
 For 
Religious
Rites,
 either 
Devotion, Sacrifice,

or 
Burial,
 they make a round cir∣cle
of short 
Strawes,
 or 
Reeds,
 and
according to the placing of the said

Strawes,
 or 
Reeds,
 it is known
for what it was made; and to med∣dle
with such 
Circles,
 is esteem∣ed
no better than 
Sacriledge.


He saith, they worship one 
God;

as 
Creator
 of all 
things,
 to whom
their 
High-Priest
 offers 
Sacrifice,

but believes he hath somthing else
to do, than to reguard 
Humane
Affairs,
 but doth commit the Go∣vernment
thereof to lesser 
Deities;

that is, to 
good
 and 
evil Spirits,

to whom their Inferiour 
Priests



makes their 
Devotion,
 and 
Sacri∣fice.

He saith, they beleive the

Transmigration
 of the 
Soul,
 and
when any one dyeth, they Interr
with the 
Corps, Provisions,
 and

Housholdstuff
 for the 
Elizium
 or
next 
World,
 which they fancy to
be beyond the 
Mountains,
 and

Indian Ocean.
 He further saith,
that from four women, they believe
all mankind Sprung, and do there∣fore
divide themselves into as ma∣ny

Tribes;
 and in their 
Marriages,

they are very Superstitious.


He saith, they are generally
well-proportionate; they are great
Favourers of the 
English,
 living
together in Love and Friendship,
and upon all occasions, ready to
contribute their assistance unto
them. They are generally of a
good, and honest meaning, no
wayes addicted to 
Vice,
 or to 
Ex∣Extravagancies,



contending them∣selves
with a mean 
Dyet
 and 
Ap∣parrel

for their present subsistance,
not taking much care for the time
to come. He further saith, that
they are much addicted to 
Mirth,

and 
Dancing;
 they are also much
prone to 
Honour,
 and 
Valour,

which they place above all other

Vertues,
 which doth occasion them
to be so continually engaged a∣gainst
one another in Wars: and
that side which Fortune Crown∣eth
with Victory, Triumphal 
Jol∣laties

are performed by them.


The 
Countrey
 (he saith) is di∣vided
into several petty 
Kingdoms,

and the 
People
 in the one, keep no
good Correspondence with those
that border upon them, and on
the least occasion, wage 
War
 one
against another.


In this 
Countrey
 of 
Carolina
 (he


saith) that there are several 
Indi∣an
Towns
 which are generally the
Habitation of the 
King,
 that com∣mands
the 
Territory.






The Proprietors of Carolina.


This 
Province
 or 
Countrey
 of

Carolina,
 was first Possessed by the

English,
 about the year 1660, and
became a 
Proprietorship;
 which
his present 
Majesty
 K. 
Charles
 the
Second, granted by Patent to the
Right Noble, 
George

And the said 
Lords proprietors,

having by their 
Patent,
 power to
establish a 
Government,
 and make

Lawes
 for the better Regulation
thereof, and the inviting of 
Inha∣bitants,

have formed a 
Model,

(which by the general consent of
all the 
Proprietors)
 was drawn up
by the Right Honourable the Lord

Ashley,
 a person of great Worth,
and Prudence; whose knowledg
in matters of 
State,
 and the 
Settle∣ment

of a 
Government,
 is suffici∣ently


praise worthy by all perso
▪
Which said 
Model
 is so well fr
¦med
for the good and welfare 

the 
Inhabitants,
 that it is estee
¦ed
by all judicious persons withou

compare; but the said 
Model,
 b
¦ing
too long to be set down in th

small Treatise, I must be constra
¦ned
to omit it.






The Settlements of the English.


Here are at present two conside∣rable
Settlements of the 
English,

for so short a time, the one at 
Al∣bemarle
-River
in the 
North,
 and
the other about the midst of the

Countrey
 on 
Ashley River,
 which is
likely to be the 
Scale
 of Trade for
the whole Countrey, as being sci∣tuate
very Commodious for Ship∣ping,
and in a healthful place.

A
DESCRIPTION
OF
VIRGINIA.




Its Bounds.


VIRGINIA
 particularly now
so called,
 hath for its Sou∣thern
Limits, 
Carolina;
 for
its Eastern, the 
Atlantick

Ocean; for its Northern, 
Mariland;

and for its Western, that vast tract
of 
Land
 which runneth into the

South-Sea.








Its Name.


This 
Countrey
 was said to b

first discovered by Sr. 
Franc

Drake
 (as indeed all this Tract o

Sea-Coast)
 and was so named by
Sir. 
Walter Rawleigh,
 (a great pro¦moter
of this discovery,) in honou

of Queen 
Elizabeth,
 who the

Reigned.






The Settlement of the English.


Much time was spent in the disco¦very
of this 
Countrey,
 with vast ex¦pences
in the setting forth of 
Ships

and not without the great loss o

many a poor wretches life, besore
it could be brought to perfection;
but at length, through the Industry
of
 Captain 
John Smith,
 and other
worthy persons, who took great


pains for the advancement of these
discoveries, fortune began to smile

n her, and about the Reign of
King 
James,
 a 
Patent
 was grant∣
d
to certain persons as a 
Corpora∣
ion,

and called the Company of

Adventurers
 of 
Virginia.
 Af∣terwards
other 
Patents
 were
granted to them for larger Extents
of 
Land
 excluded in the former;

ut the said 
Corporation
 commit∣ting
of several, and frequent Mis∣demeanours,
and Miscarriages, the
said 
Patent
 about the year 1623
was made 
Nul;
 since which it hath
been free for all his 
Majesties Sub∣jects,

to 
Trade
 into these parts.






Its Air and Temperature.


This 
Countrey
 is blest with a
sweet aud wholesome 
Air,
 and
the 
Clime
 of late very agreeable to


the 
English,
 since the clearing o


Woods;
 so that now few dyeth o

the 
Countreys
 disease, called th


Seasoning.






The Soyl.


It is every where interlaced with
delectable 
Hills,
 and rich 
Valleys

and of a 
Soyl
 so Fertile, that an A¦cre
of ground commonly yieldeth
200 
Bushels
 of Corn, and is very
apt to produce what is put therein,
as 
English Grains,
 
Roots, Seeds,
Plants, Fruits,
 &c. besides those
appropriated to the 
Countrey,
 and
other adjacent parts of 
America.






Their Fruits.

Commodities
 which this Coun∣trey
doth,
 or may produce, are

Hemp, Flax, Hops, Rape-Seed, An∣niceseed,
Wood, Madder, Pot-Ashes▪
Honey, Wax, Silk,
 (if they would
make it, 
Mulberry-Trees
 here
growing in such great plenty) 
Sax¦afras,
Sarsaparilla,
 several swee


Gums,

and 
Salted Flesh
 and 
Fish,
 which
find vent at the 
Barbadoes,
 and o∣ther

Caribbe Isles;
 but above all
these, their chief 
Commodity
 is 
To∣bacco,



which they are sure to find
vent for, and is the Standard by
which all other 
Commodities
 are
prized; but it were well for the

Inhabitants
 if they would imploy
their time, about the making of

Silk,
 or some other 
Commodities,

which in a short time would be
found more advantageous unto
them, & then their 
Tobacco
 would
not be so great a Drug as of late it
is, insomuch that the 
Merchant
 oft∣times
had rather lose it, then to
pay the charges and Duties of

Freight, Custome, Excise,
 &c.


Here groweth a kind of 
Flax,

called 
Silk-grass,
 of which the

Indians
 make 
Thred,
 and 
Strings,

and is good to make 
Linnen-cloth,

and 
Shifts,
 and would make ex∣cellent
strong 
Cables.








Their Trade.


Here all 
Trades-men,
 especially

Handicrafts
 finds good encourage∣ment;
and for those 
Commodities

aforesaid, the 
English
 (who have
the sole 
Trade)
 bring them all sorts
of 
Apparel,
 all manner of 
Utin∣sills,

belonging to 
Household-stuf,

or necessary in their 
Plantations,

or otherwise; also 
Wine, Brandy,

and other strong 
Drinks;
 likewise
all 
Silks, Stuf
 and 
Cloth,
 both 
Lin∣nen

and 
Wollen,
 which they con∣vert
to several uses according to
their Fancyes, being now supply∣ed
by 
Taylors.






Their Trees.


Here groweth sundry sorts of

Trees,
 of the red and white 
Oak


Black Walnut,
 
Cedar, Pine Cy∣prus,
Chesnut, Poppler, Ash, Elm,

&c. many of which are very good
for the building of 
Ships,
 and other
uses.






The Rivers.


This Country is well watered
with several great, and strong 
Ri∣vers

which lose themselves in the
Gulph or bay of Chesopeak, which
gives entrance for shipping in this

Country,
 as also to 
Mary-Land

next adjoyning; which said 
Bay
 is
very large, Capacious, and Co∣modious
for 
Shipping,
 being said
to run up into the 
Countrey
 north∣wards
near 75 Leagues; its breadth
in many places, being 5, 6, or 7
Leagues, and sometimes more, and
6 or 7 Fathom deep, and its ope∣ning
to the South between 
Cape-Henry,



which begineth 
Virginia,

and 
Cape-Charles
 on the other
side opposite, being about 10, or 12

Leagues
 wide.


The principal of these 
Rivers

begining at 
Cape-Henry,
 are 
Paw∣hatan,

now called 
James-River,
 be∣ing
very large & Commodious for
ships, and found navigable about
50 
Leagues. Pamaunke,
 now 
York-River,

also large and 
Navigable,
 a∣bout
20 Leagues. 
Rapahanock
 or

Toppahanock,
 likewise a good
River and 
Navigable,
 about 40.
Leagues, which is the last Ri∣ver
of 
Virginia
 Northwardly,
that falls into the 
Bay
 of 
Cheso∣peack.






Their Townes.


Upon, or near, these 
Rivers

for the conveniency of shipping,


the 
English
 are seated, which at
present do amount unto the num∣ber
of about 30, or 40000, and
have some 
Townes,
 the chief a∣mongst
which, is 
James-Town,
 or
rather 
James City,
 commodiously
seated 
James-River;
 the 
Town

is beautified with many fair and
well built Brick Houses, and as it
is the chief town of the 
Countrey;

here is kept the 
Courts
 of 
Judica∣ture

and 
Offices
 of publique con∣cern;
not far from which, at 
Green-Spring,

resideth the 
Governour
 Sir

William Berkley.


Next to 
James-town
 may be
reckoned that of 
Elizabeth,
 seated
at the mouth of the said River, a
well built Town.


Also
 Dales-gift,
 Wicocomoco,
Bermuda, 
and others.








The English Government.


This Countrey
 is Governed by

Laws
 agreeable with those of 
Eng∣land,

for the deciding of all 
Causes

both 
Civil
 and 
Criminal;
 which
said 
Laws
 are thus made by the

Governour,
 appointed by his 
Ma∣jesty,

with the consent of the 
Ge∣neral
Assembly,
 which doth consist
of his 
Council,
 and the 
Burgesses

chosen by the 
Free-holders.


And for the better 
Government,

the 
Countrey,
 which is possessed by
the 
English,
 is divided into seve∣ral

Counties,
 in each of which are

Sheriffs, Justices
 of the 
Peace,
 and
other 
Officers,
 which are from
time to time appoynted by the

Governour;
 The names of the

Counties
 are those of 
Carotuck,


Charles, Glocester, Hartford, Hen∣rico,


James, New-Kent, Lancastar,
Middlesex, Nansemund, Lower-Norfolk,
Northampton, Northum∣berland,
Rappahanock, Surrey,
Warwick, Westmorland,
 Isle of

Wight,
 and 
York,
 and in each of
these 
Counties,
 are held petty

Courts,
 every month from which
there may be 
Appeales
 to the

Quarter-Court
 held at 
James-Town.






The Natives or Indians.


Virginia
 was, and yet is the
habitation of divers sorts of 
Indi∣ans,

which have no dependance
upon each other, being of parti∣cular

Tribes,
 and having their pe∣culiar
King to Govern them; eve∣ry

Indian-Town,
 or rather poor

Village,
 being the habitation of a

King;
 and these 
People
 do rather


live at enmity, than amity together.
And as to their 
Dispositions, Man∣ners,
Religions,
 &c. there is found
a difference, but most of all in
their 
Languages;
 so that those 
Peo∣ple

may not improperly be called
so many several 
Nations.


They are generally a sort of
people well proportionate, stout,
of a swarthy complexion, their
Hair black, and flaggy, which they
wear long; they are of a ready
Wit, very Subtile, and Treache∣rous,
not much addicted to labour,
being too great lovers of their ease;
they are much given to 
Hunting,

and going to 
Wars
 with each other,
their Weapons being the 
Bow
 and

Arrows,
 at which they are very ex∣pert,
being good marks-men;
but of late they have got the use
of 
Guns,
 and other 
Weapons,

through the folly of the English in


shewing them. They are very lo∣ving
and obedient to their 
Kings;

in 
matters
 of 
Religion,
 they ob∣serve
strange 
Ceremonies,
 and
their 
Priests
 (which are esteemed

Conjurers)
 makes 
Sacrifices
 for
them. They believe the 
Transmi∣gration

of the 
Soul,
 and have
strange fancies about the 
Creation

of they 
World,
 they believe
there is a God, but think he
hath something else to do then
to concern himself with things
below, as too inferiour for him, and
do therefore not Worship him;
but the 
Divel
 they worship out of
a fear, least he should destroy them,
as having the power of them.


Their 
Apparel
 is but mean,

only contenting themselves with
something to cover their Naked∣ness;
and for the better defen∣ding
themselves from the weather,


they anoynt their Bodyes with
certain 
Oyles
 mixt with 
Beares
Grease.


Their 
Houses
 are no better
then our 
English Hogsties,
 and are
made of 
Boughs,
 and covered with

Bark
 of 
Trees;
 and in the midst
thereof, is placed their 
Chimney,
 or

Fire-place.


Their 
Dyet
 in meaness,
 is ans∣werable
to their Houses, not en∣deavouring
to please their 
Pal∣lets

with curious 
Sauces,
 or pom∣pering
their Bodies with pro∣vokative

Meates.

Its Scituation and Bounds.


THe

of 37, and 50 
mi∣nutes,

or thereabouts,
and 40 degrees of 
Northern La∣titude.

It hath for its Bounds on

Virginia,
 (from which
it is parted by the River 
Patow∣meck,



whose Southerly bank di∣vides
the Province from 
Virginia;)

on the 
East,
 the 
Atlantick Ocean,

and 
Delaware-Bay;
 on the North,

New-England,
 and 
New-York,

formerly part of 
New-England,

lying on the East side of 
Delaware-Bay;

and on the West, the true

Meridian
 of the first fountain of the
River of 
Patowmeck.


The 
Bay
 of 
Chesopeack
 giving
entrance to 
Ships
 into 
Virginia,

and 
Maryland,
 passeth through the
heart of this 
Province,
 and is found
Navigable near 200 
miles;
 into
which falls the Rivers of 
Patow∣meck,
Patuxent, Ann-Arundel,

(alas 
Severn)
 and 
Sasquesahanough,

lying on the West side of the 
Bay;

and to the East of the said 
Bay,

those of 
Choptanke, Nantecoke,
Pocomoke,
 and several other 
Ri∣vers

and 
Rivulets,
 to the great


improvement of the Soyl, and
Beauty of this 
Province.


The Countrey of late, since the
Felling of the 
Woods,
 and the 
Peo∣ples

accustoming themselves to

English Dyet,
 is very healthful and
and agreeable to the constitution
of the 
English,
 few now dying at
their first coming, of the 
Countreys
disease,
 or 
Seasoning.
 And as to
the Temperature of 
Air,
 the 
heats

in 
Summer,
 receive such seasonable
allayes from gentle breezes, and
fresh Showres of Rain; and the

Cold
 in 
Winter,
 is of so little du∣rance,
that the 
Inhabitants
 cannot
be said to suffer by either.






The Soyl, &c.


The 
Countrey
 is generally plain
and even, yet rising in some pla∣ces
into small and pleasant Hills,


which heighten the beauty of the
adjacent 
Valleys.


The 
Soyl
 is Rich and Fertil,
naturally producing all such 
Com∣modities

as are in the precedent dis∣course
set down as peculiar to its
neighbouring Colony, 
Virginia;

as all sorts of 
Beasts
 and 
Fowle

both Tame and Wild;
 
Fish, Fruits,
Plants, Roots, Herbs, Gums, Trees,
Balsomes,
 &c. as likewise all 
Com∣modities

produced by Industry, are
here found in as great plenty and
perfection: But the general trade
of 
Maryland
 depends chiefly up∣on

Tobacco,
 which being esteem∣ed
better for a Forreign 
Market

than that of 
Virginia,
 finds great
Vent abroad, and the 
Planters
 at
home; in exchange thereof, are
furnished by the 
Merchant
 with all
necessaries, for himself, his 
House,Family,
 and 
Plantation.



Their is a Competent stock of
ready mony in this 
Province
 both
of English,
 Forreign, and his
Lordshipps own 
Coyne,
 yet their
chief way of 
Commerce
 is by way
of barter, or exchange of 
Commodi∣ties,

which may be judged to be
no wayes inconsiderable, since
100 sail of 
Ships
 from 
England,

and the English 
Plantations,
 have
of late Yeares been known to
trade thither in one Year.






The Natives.


The 
Natives,
 as to their 
Com∣plexion,
Stature, Customes, Dis∣positions,
Laws, Religions, Appa∣rel,
Dyet, Houses,
 &c. are much
the same as those of 
Virginia,
 al∣ready
treated of; being likewise
many different 
Tribes,
 or sorts of
People, and each Govern'd by their
particular 
King.








The Government, &c. of
this Countrey.


This 
Province
 of 
Maryland,
 his

Majesty
 King 
Charles
 the first in

Anno
 1632, granted by 
Patent
 to
the Right Honourable 
Caecilius
Calvert,
 Lord 
Baltemore,
 and to
his 
Heires
 and Assignes; and by
that Patent created him, and
them, the true and absolute 
Lords

and 
Propriators
 of the same, (sa∣ving
the Allegiance and Sove∣raigne
Dominion due to his 
Ma∣jesty,

his 
Heirs,
 and 
Successours;)

thereby likewise granting to them
all 
Royal Jurisdictions,
 and 
Prero∣gatives

both 
Millitary
 and 
Civil;

as power of enacting 
Laws, Mar∣tial
Laws,
 making of 
War,
 and

Peace, pardoning
 of 
Offences,

Conferring of 
Honours, Coyning



of 
Money,
 &c. And in acknow∣ledgement
thereof, yeilding and
and paying yearly to his Majesty,
his 
Heires
 and Successors, two 
In∣dian
Arrows
 at 
Windsor Castle
 in
the County of 
Berks,
 on 
Easter
Tuesday;
 together with the fifth
part of all the 
Gold
 and 
Silver Oare

that shall be found there.


For the better inviting of peo∣ple
to settle here, his Lordship, by
advice of the General 
Assembly
 of
that 
Province,
 hath long since esta∣blished
a 
Model
 of good and whol∣some

Laws
 for the ease and be∣nefit
of the 
Inhabitants,
 with tol∣leration
of 
Religion,
 to all sorts
that profess the Faith of 
Christ:

which hath been a principal motive
to many to settle under that 
Govern∣ment,

rather then in another where
liberty of Conscience was de∣nyed
them.








Its division into Countyes.


This 
Province
 where it is peo∣pled
with 
English,
 is severed into
10 
Counties;
 to wit, 5 Eastwards
of 
Chesopeak Bay,
 as 
Cecil, Dor∣chester,
Kent, Sommerset, and Tal∣bot;

and 5 westwards of the said

Bay,
 as 
Ann-Arundel, Baltemore,
Calvert, Charles
 and St. 
Maries.

And in every one of these 
Coun∣tyes,

there is held an inferiour

Court
 every two months for small
matters, from which there lyeth
Appeales to the 
Provincial Court,

held at St. 
Maryes.
 Here are like∣wise
certain 
Magistrates
 appoyn∣ted
by his Lordship in each 
Coun∣ty,

as 
Sheriffs, Justices
 of the

Peace,
 &c.








Their Townes.


The Inhabitants (being in num∣ber
at present about 16000) have
begun the building of several

Townes,
 which in few Yeares 'tis
hoped may come to some per∣fection;
as 
Calverton, Herrington,

and 
Harvy-Town,
 all Commodi∣ously
seated for the benefit of

Trade,
 and conveniency of 
Ship∣ping,

but the principal Town is

St. Maryes,
 seated on 
St. Georges
River,
 being beautified with di∣vers
well-built 
Houses,
 and is the
cheif place or scale of 
Trade
 for
the 
Province,
 where the 
Gover∣nour

his Lordships Son and Heir,
Mr. 
Charles Calvert
 hath his

House,
 and where the 
General
Assembly,
 and 
Provincial Courts

are held, and 
Publique Offices



kept; but at present the said 
Gover∣nour

doth reside at 
Mattapany,
 a∣bout
8 Miles distant where he
hath a fair and pleasant 
House.

And for the better assisting the
said 
Governour,
 in matters that
concerns the 
Government
 of the

Province,
 he hath his Council,
&c.










A
DESCRIPTION
OF
New-YORK.


ADjoyning to 
Mary-Land,

Northwards, is a Colony
called 
New-York,
 from
his 
Royal Highness
 the
Duke of 
York,
 the 
Proprietor

thereof by grant from his Majesty,
and is that part of 
New-England

which the 
Dutch
 formerly seized,
and called the New-
Netherlands.






Its Fertility, &c.


It is a 
Countrey,
 of a Rich and
Fertile 
Soyl,
 well watered with

Rivers,
 as is 
Mary-Land
 already
spoken of, and is found to pro∣duce
the same 
Beasts, Birds, Fish,
Fruits, Commodities, Trees,
 &c.
and in as great plenty.






Its Town.


Here is one very considerable

Town,
 first built by the 
Dutch,
 and
called 
New-Amsterdam,
 which
name is now changed to 
New-York:

It is well seated both for 
Trade,
Security,
 and 
Pleasure,
 in a small

Isle
 called 
Mahatan,
 reguarding
the 
Sea,
 made so by 
Hudsons-Ri∣ver,

which severeth it from 
Long-Island,

which said River is very


commodious for 
Shipping,
 and is
about two 
Leagues
 broad. The

Town
 is large, containing about
five hundred well-built 
Houses;

and for Civil 
Government,
 it hath
a 
Mayor, Alderman,
 a 
Sheriff,
 and

Justices
 of the 
Peace
 for their

Magistrates.
 For the further se∣curity
of this 
Town,
 here is raised
a 
Fort
 called 
James-Fort,
 which
is very strong, and well Defen∣ded
and Maintained with 
Men,

and 
Ammunition.
 The 
Town
 is
Inhabited by the 
English,
 and

Dutch,
 and hath a considerable

Trade
 with the 
Indians,
 for the

Skins
 of 
Elks, Deer, Bears,
 &c.
also for those of 
Bever, Otter,
 and
other 
Furrs;
 and doth likewise
enjoy a good 
Trade
 with the 
En∣glish.








The Natives.


This Countrey is also possessed
with sundry sorts of people, not
much unlike the 
Indians
 of 
Virgi∣nia,

being well-
proportioned, Stout,
Swarthy, Black haired,
 very ex∣pert
in their 
Bow,
 and 
Arrows,

which are their chief weapons of
War.
 They are courteous to the

English,
 of a ready Witt, and very
apt to receive Instructions from
them; upon the least Offence,
the man turneth away his wife, and
marrieth again, and the 
Children
 be∣gotten
by her, she taketh with her,
the 
man
 not regarding them. 
For∣nication

is here permitted. They
observe several 
Ceremonies
 in their

Religious Rites,
 and are said to
worship the 
Devil,
 whom they
greatly fear. Their 
Priests
 are


no better than 
Sorcerers,
 who
strangly bewitch these silly 
Crea∣tures.

When any woman findeth
her self quick with 
Child,
 she keep∣eth
her self chast, or untouched
by man until her delivery, the
like she observeth in the time of
her giving Suck. A strange custom
which our 
European Dames
 would
not well like of! They are very
obedient and loving to their 
Kings:

They believe the 
Transmigration

of the 
Soul;
 and concerning the
Creation of the 
World,
 have a
strange fantastical opinions. They
are much addicted to 
Dancing,
Sports,
 and 
Recreations,
 observing

Festival Times.


Their 
Habit
 is but mean,
 as the
rest of the 
Indians,
 yet do they

Paint
 and besmear their 
Faces

with several 
Colours
 by way of
Ornament.



There 
Dyet
 and 
Habitations
 are
also as mean.


They are much addicted to go
to 
Wars
 against one another, and
do seldome give quarter to any
but the 
Women
 and 
Children,
 whom
they preserve, and make use of
for the encreasing their strength.










A
DESCRIPTION
OF
New-ENGLAND.




Its Situation.


NEw England
 is seated North
of 
Maryland,
 which ac∣cording
to the report of
Capt. 
Smith,
 hath 70 miles
of 
Sea Coast,
 where are found di∣vers
good 
Havens,
 some of which
are capable to harbour 500 
Saile

of 
Shipps
 from the fury the of

Sea,
 and Winds, by reason of the


interposition of several 
Isles
 (to
the number of about 200) which
lie about this 
Coast.


And although this 
Countrey
 is
seated in the midst of the 
Tem∣perate
Zone,
 yet is the 
Clime

more uncertain, as to 
Heat
 and

Cold,
 then those 
European King∣domes,

which lie 
Parallel
 with it;
and as to 
Virginia,
 this may be
compared as 
Scotland
 is to 
Eng∣land.






The Aire.


The 
Aire
 is here found very
healthful,
 and very agreeable to
the 
English,
 which makes them
possess many potent 
Colonyes.






Its Inhabitants.


This 
Countrey
 is possessed by


divers sorts of 
People,
 who are 
Go∣verned

by their particular 
Kings,

and do much differ in 
Customes,

and 
Manners,
 from one another, as
those 
Indians
 inhabiting in 
Mary∣Land,
Virginia,
 and other parts of

America.
 And do live generally at
variance with each other. They
have their several 
Townes
 and 
set∣tlements,

and their Riches doth
consist in their 
Furs,
 and 
Skins,

which they sell to the 
English.






When first inhabited by the
English.


This 
Countrey
 became first to
be a 
Colony
 of the 
English
 about
the 
Year
 1605, being granted by

Patent
 from 
King James,
 to cer∣tain
proprietors under the name
of the 
Plymouth Company;
 but di∣vers
years were spun out, with great


expences, and not without sundry
casualties befalling on the 
Adven∣turers,

before it became any thing
considerable, and in a setled con∣dition.






Their Rivers, and Fish.


This
 Country 
is well watered
with
 Rivers, 
the chief amongst
which, are
 Agamentico, Conecte∣cut,
Kinebequy, Merrimeck, Mishuin,
Mistick, Neraganset, Pascataway,
Pemnaquid, Tachobacco, 
&c. and
in these
 Rivers, 
together with the

Sea,
 
are taken excellent
 Fish, 
as

Cod, Thornback, Sturgeon, Por∣puses,
Haddock, Salmons, Her∣rings,
Mackeril, Oysters, Lobsters,
Crab-Fish, Tortoise, Cocles, Mus∣cles,
Clams, Smelts, Eels, Lam∣prons,
Alewives, Basses, Hollibuts,
Sharks, Seales, Grampus, 
and

Whales.








Their Fowles, and Birds.


Here are great variety of Fowls,
as
 Phesants, Partridges, Heath∣Cocks,
Turkeys, Geess, Ducks,
Hernes, Cranes, Cormorants,
Swans, Widgins, Sheldrakes,
Snipes, Doppers, Blackbirds, 
the

Humbird, Loon, 
&c.






Their Beasts, both Tame
and Wild.


Their
 Wild Beasts 
of chief note,
are
 Lyons, Beares, Foxes, Rac∣koons,
Mooses, Musquashs, Otters,
Bevers, Deer, Hares, Coneys, 
&c.
and for
 Tame Beasts, Cowes, Sheep,
Goates, Swine, 
and
 Horses.


Amongst the hurtful 
things
 in
this 
Countrey,
 the 
Rattle-Snake
 is
most dangerous. Here are also se∣veral


sorts of Stinging 
Flyes;

which are found very troublesome
to the 
Inhabitants.






Their Trees, and Fruits.


Here are sundry sorts of
 Trees,


as the
 Oak, Cyprus, Pine, Chesnut,
Caedar, Walnut, Firr, Ash, Asp,
Elm, Alder, Maple, Birch, Sasa∣fras,
Sumach, 
several
 Fruit-Trees,

as
 Apples, Pears, Plumbs, 
with
several others that are growing in

Virginia, 
and
 Mary-land, 
which
 I
have already took notice of.






Their Commodities, and Trade.


This 
Countrey
 affordeth several
sorts of rich 
Furrs,
 
Flax, Linnen,
Amber, Iron, Pitch, Tarr, Ca∣bles,
Masts,
 and 
Timber
 to build

Ships,
 also several sorts of 
Grain,

&c.



The Inhabitants drive a con∣siderable
Trade to 
Barbadoes,
 and
other our 
American Plantations,

in supplying them with 
Flower,
Bisket, Salt, Flesh,
 and 
Fish,
 &c.
and in return bring 
Sugars,
 and
other 
Commodities,
 as well for
their own use, as to sell again.
They also drive a considerable

Trade
 with 
England
 for 
wearing
Apparrel, Stuffs, Silks, Cloth,
 se∣veral

Utensils
 for their 
Houses, Iron,
Brass,
 and such like things that are
useful to man and not found a∣mongst
them.


As to the 
Coyns, Weights,
 and

Measures
 of 
New-England,
 and the
rest of the 
American Plantations

belonging to his 
Majesty,
 they are
the same with those of 
London,

but as to 
Coyns,
 they are not much
made use of in 
Trade,
 their way
being bartering of one 
Commodi∣ty



for another; but at 
Jamaica

they have plenty of 
Spanish Coins,

and at 
Barbadoes
 those of 
England.


The 
English
 now Inhabiting in

New-England,
 are very nume∣rous,
and powerful, having a great
many Towns, many of which are
considerable.






The English Government.


The 
Inhabitants
 are 
Governed

by 
Laws
 of their own making,
 and
have their several 
Courts,
 and pla∣ces
of 
Judicature,
 and assemble
together, at their set times, and
places, as well for the making of
New 
Lawes,
 abolishing of Old,
Hearing, and Determining of

Causes;
 as for the Election of a

Governour, Deputy-Governour,
Assistants, Burgesses,
 and other

Magistrates,
 (every Town having
two 
Burgesses)
 each 
County
 Annu∣ally


Electing such like 
Officers,
 for
the looking after the like 
Affairs

in the said 
Colony.
 And in matters
that concern 
Religion,
 and 
Church∣Government,

they are very strict
and make a great shew, being much
of the stamp of the Ridgid 
Presby∣terians.






The Towns.


Here are several Towns,
 as 
Bo∣ston,

the 
Metropolis
 of 
New-Eng∣land,

Commodiously seated for

Traffique
 on the 
Sea-Shore;
 It is
at present a very large and spacious

Town,
 or rather 
City,
 composed of
several well-ordered 
Streets,
 and
graced with fair and beautiful 
Hou∣ses,

which are well Inhabited by

Merchants,
 and 
Trades-men,
 who
drive a considerable 
Trade
 for such

Commodities
 as the 
Countrey
 affor∣eth


to 
Barbadoes,
 and the other 
Ca∣ribbee
Isles,
 as also to 
England,
 and

Ireland;
 taking in exchange such

Commodities
 as each place afford∣eth,
or are found useful to them.
It is a place of a good strength, ha∣ving
two or three 
Hills
 adjoyning,
on which are raised 
Fortifications,

with great 
Peices
 mounted there∣on,
which are well guarded.


Charles-Town,
 seated on and be∣tween
the Rivers 
Charles
 and 
Mi∣stick;

it is beautified with a large
and well-built 
Church,
 and near
the River side is the 
Market-place,

from which runneth two 
Streets,

in which are divers good 
Houses.


Dorchester
 scituate near the 
Sea,

where there falleth in two 
Rivulets.

An indifferent 
Town.


Cambridg,
 formerly 
New-Town

seated on the River 
Merrimeck:

this Town consisteth of several



Streets,
 and is beautified with two

Colledges,
 and divers fair, and well
built 
Houses.


St. 
Georges-Fort,
 seated on the
mouth of the River 
Sagadebock.


New-Plimouth,
 seated on that
large 
Bay
 of 
Potuxed.


Reading,
 commodiously seated
about a great

 and well-wa∣tered,
and 
Inhabited.
 In this
Town are two 
Mills,
 one for 
Corn,

and the other for 
Timber.

 pleasantly seated betwixt
two 
Rivers.






Other Towns placed Al∣phabetically.


Berwick, Braintree, Bristol, Con∣cord,

Exeter, Falmouth, Glocester, Greens-Harbour,
Hampton, Hartford, Ha∣verhil,
Hingham, Hull, Ipswich,

Northam, Norwich, Oxford,
Rowley, Roxbury, Salisbury, Sand∣wich,
Southampton, Spring-field,
Sudbury, Taunton, Water-Town,
Wenham, Weymouth, Woburne, 
and

Yarmouth.


Most of these 
Towns
 beareth the
names from those in 
England,
 and
many of them are of good account,
being commodiously seated, either
on the Sea-Shore, or on Naviga∣ble

Rivers,
 and are well Inhabited.
And most of those 
Towns
 are
known to the 
Indians
 by other
Names.










A
DESCRIPTION
OF
NEW-FOƲND-LAND.


NEwfoundland
 is an 
Island
 in
Extent equal to 
England,

from whence it is distant
little above 600 
Leagues,

lying near half way between 
Ire∣land,

and 
Virginia.


It is 
scituated
 betwixt the de∣grees
of 46, and 53 of Northern

Latitudes,
 and it is only severed
from the Continent of 
America,
 by


an Arm of the 
Sea,
 like that which
separates 
England
 from 
France.




Its Bays, Rivers, Fish, Fowl,
Beasts, &c.


It is Famous for many spacious
and excellent 
Bayes,
 and 
Harbours,

and within the 
Land
 for the vari∣ety
of Fresh 
Springs,
 whose waters
are exceeding delicious.


It is enriched by nature,
 with
plenty of 
Fish, Land,
 and 
Water-Fowl,

and sufficiently stockt with

Deer, Hares, Otters, Foxes, Squirils,

and other 
Beasts
 which yield good

Furrs:
 And though not over-run
generally with 
Woods,
 it doth af∣ford
(besides store of 
Fewel)
 abun∣dance
of stately 
Trees,
 fit for 
Tim∣ber,
Masts, Planks,
 and sundry o∣ther
uses.








The soile and Climate.


The 
Soile
 in most places is repu∣ted
fertile; the Climate whol∣some,
though the rigour of the 
win∣ter

season, and the excess of 
Heats

in 
Summer,
 doth detract something
from its due praise.






How Inhabited.


The North and West part of
this 
Countrey
 the 
Native-Indians

Inhabit,
 though but few in num∣ber,
and those a more rude and
savage sort of People then those
of 
New-England
 and other places
in the adjacent Contenent, already
taken notice of.








New-found-Land first discove∣red
by the English.


The 
Island,
 of 
New-found Land

was first discovered by the 
Eng∣lish,

who are the true 
Propriators

thereof, excluding all Forreigne
right, and justifying the same to be∣long
to the Crown of 
England
 on∣ly,
whose Interest hath been there
continued by several, under the
Reigns of divers 
Kings
 & 
Queens.


In the year 1623,
 Sir 
George
Calvert
 Knight, then 
Principal Se∣cretary

of 
State
 and afterwards Ld.

Baltemore,
 obtained a 
Patent
 of
part of 
New-found-land;
 which was
erected into a 
Province,
 and called

Avalon;
 where he caused a Planta∣tion
to be setled, and a stately 
House

and 
Fort
 to be built at 
Ferryland,

and afterwards Transported him∣self


and Family thither, and conti∣nuing
the 
Plantation
 by his 
Deputy,

till by descent (after his Lordships
decease) it came to his son and
heir the Right Honorable 
Caecilius,

now Lord 
Baltemore,
 who by 
De∣puties

from time to time, was no
less careful to preserve his Interest
there, which (though during the
late troubles in 
England,
 it was by
Sir 
David Kirkes
 means, for some
years discontinued, he was soon re∣invested
in the same by his Maje∣sties
most happy Restauration.


There is no part of 
New-found-land

generally more happy for mul∣tiplicity
of excellent 
Bayes,
 and

Harbours,
 then this 
Province,
 and
where vast quantities of 
Fish
 are
yearly caught by the 
English,
 espe∣cially
at 
Ferryland,
 and the 
Bay
 of

Bulls.
 But the whole 
Coast
 of the

Island,
 affords infinite plenty of



Codd,
 and 
Poor-John,
 which is the
chief 
Commodity
 of the 
Isle,
 which
is grown to a setled 
Trade,
 for these
many years, to the 
enrichment
 of
all those that Trade thither.






A great bank of Land.


East of 
Newfoundland,
 over a∣gainst

Cape-Ray,
 at the distance of
about 70 
miles,
 lyeth a great Bank
of Land, of about 300 
miles
 in
Length, and not above Seventy∣five
in Breadth, where broadest.
It lyes under the 
Sea
 many 
Fa∣thoms

deep, so the 
Ships
 of a con∣siderable
Burthen may ride over
it: and about this Banck lyes dis∣persed
several small 
Isles,
 called
by St. 
Sebastion Cabot
 (the first
discoverer) 
Los Baccaloos,
 or the
Isles of 
Cod-fish,
 from the prodi∣gious
quantities of 
Cod-Fish
 there


found, which were said to obstruct

he passage of his 
Vessels.






The Trade to this Island.


The 
French,
 
Dutch, Biscaners,

and other 
Nations
 that yearely

Trade
 hither amounting to be∣tween
3 or 400 
Vessels,
 are assu∣red
to find sufficient 
Freight
 of

Cod
 and 
Poor John,
 which they
find good vent for in the 
Streights,
Spaine, France
- and other 
Coun∣treys

to their great profit and en∣couragement.


And were the 
English
 diligent
to inspect the advantage that
might accrue to this 
Nation,
 by
settling 
Plantations
 on the Island,
and raising 
Fortifications,
 for the
security of the place; we might
give Law to all forreigners that
come to 
Fish
 there, and in few


Years engross the whole 
Fishery

to our selves: the greatest 
Bal∣lance

perchance of 
Forraigne
Trade.


FINIS.
