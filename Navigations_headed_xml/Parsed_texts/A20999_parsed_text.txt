A TRVE DISCOVRSE Of the Plot of Monsieur du TERRAIL, against 
Geneua,
 the 19. of April, 1609.


I
T is now about three yeeres since, aduice was giuen from some of good place, that 
Monsier du Terrail
 being much discon∣tented, that he was not seconded in his vndertakings in the Low-countreys, whereby he foresaw that in the end all would be lost, had resolued to serue the Duke of 
Sauoy,
 and also had openly giuen out, that hee had in his Forge a notable enterprise vpon 
Geneua.
 In pursute of which, he was seene shortly af∣ter to come to 
Paris,
 with pretence of reconciling himselfe to the Kings fauour. But good aduertise∣ment was giuen, that hee was to come for 
Sauoy.
 These his dissignes were then interrupted by a Mur∣der, hee committed in the 
Louure
 in presence of the

 King. Whereupon to flie the great displeasure of the King, he soone turn'd head to the 
Archdukes,
 from whence after some sixe Moneths stay, he vndertooke a Pilgrimage to our Lady of 
Loretto,
 with one 
Basti∣de
 an Inginer, whom hee tooke to him for Counsell and aide of his executions: They went a foote, and in their returne had priuate conference with the D. of 
Sauoy.
 Notwithstanding, the Count 
Fuentes
 adui∣sed this 
Terrail
 otherwise, giuing him to vnderstand that the Duke would embrace his Seruice against 
Geneua,
 but it would bee his ouerthrow. The Duke communicated to him and his man his dissignes for 
Geneua,
 as shall followingly appeare by Letters, and Confessions; and from that time they rested in 
Sauoy,
 making two Voyages to 
Turin
 for the same affaire. They of 
Geneua
 had presently great distrust, receiuing aduertisements one in the necke of another, from all parts, of a notable, and in a maner vnauoidable en∣terprise against them, carried by 
Monsieur du Terrail.
 All the Gouernours either of Prouinces or Places adioyning from the 
French
 King, gaue diuers very pregnant intelligences, but without any way disco∣uering the meanes.


The Sauoyards, already sang the Triumph, cau∣sing to be inserted in an Almanacke of one of their Astrologers, the certaintie of the Act about the Mo∣neth of May (which was the time destined to the Ex∣ecution) in the end of his predictions. Which Al∣manacke Printed at 
Lions,
 was in exceeding request for this particularitie. The 
French
 King also aduer∣tised the State of 
Geneua,
 that they should doe him a good seruice, if they could seise him, and gaue them

 this meanes, assuring them that he was about 
Geneua,
 or the Countrey of 
Berne,
 and if they could dispacth him, the Act would be to him most acceptable.


While they were in this doubtfull mist, God sent them a small light, was greater then all, which since serued them as a Keye to open to the depth of the Plot, and to conuince first the seruant of 
Terrail,
 and afterward himselfe. 
Terrail,
 hauing on a day plaide at Tennise at 
Chamberi,
 and retiring in his heate to rubbe and refresh himselfe, went into a bed; where, while a seruant of the Tennise Court warmed him a shirt, there came into him 
Bastide,
 and some other, well marked by this youth, and presented him a Pa∣per, which was the Plot of 
Geneua,
 and discourst soft∣ly among themselues, as of some matter of impor∣tance: Insomuch as the fellow ouer hearing them, name some places of the Fortresse of 
Geneua,
 leant his eare with more attention; and gathered for cer∣tain, that their discourse was about some Enterprise, they had against that place; and heard that 
Terrail
 after long conference, made no difficultie saue of the meanes to raise sufficient Force to carrie the affaire. In which point being satisfied by the assistants, hee brake out alowde in these tearmes. They are ours, they cannot escape vs. Which words being well marked by the youth of the Tennise Court, who had a Brother in the Garrison of 
Geneua,
 and whome he was willing to saue from this mischiefe, he went pre∣sently and discouered it to a Townesman of 
Geneua,
 who was then in 
Chamberi
 about some businesse. This Townsman made faithfull report thereof to the Magistrate of 
Geneua,
 and the brother of the youth.




After this time, they of 
Geneua
 vsed all deligence by spies, to know his comming and going, and had him followed wheresoeuer he went. In the end they had certaine notice of his passing the Mountaines some sixe or seuen weekes before, and that hee was come backe by the way of the Lake 
Leman,
 wherup∣on they gaue present aduertisement to all the Bay∣liffes of the Countrey vnder the Lord of 
Berne.
 With the particular notes, and markes of the person of the said 
Terrail;
 praying them to haue an eye on him, and possesse themselues of his person, in case he passe by their Territories: for which the Magistrates of 
Berne
 being so assured of the practises of the Duke of 
Sauoy,
 against those of 
Geneua
 their confederates and against themselues also, gaue expresse commande∣ment. To this came a remarkeable accident; a Dea∣con of 
Iuerdun,
 a Towne of the 
Bernoys
 neare the frontire of the county of 
Burgoigne,
 being at 
Geneua
 came to salute the chiefe 
Syndicke
 of the Towne, and brought him Letters; He, after other discourse, told him of the manifold aduertisement they had, of the enemies disseignes against 
Geneua,
 and the country of 
Berne,
 but especially the Towne of 
Iuerdun,
 a place of greatest importance, being the key of the whole country, strong by scituation, though ill fortified, and bounding vtmost on 
Burgoigne;
 He gaue him also the marks of 
Terrail,
 of whom they had got a Picture at 
Geneua,
 because he was to come in Person to take a view of the Towne. It hapned certaine dayes after, that 
Terrail
 returning from 
Turin
 passed the Lake, and arriued in the Country of 
Berne,
 but not at the

 known and ordinary port, went through the Coun∣try, and visiting the places of most importance, ne∣uer lodging in Townes or knowne places, but vil∣lages & peasants houses til he came to 
Iuerdun:
 nei∣ther staide he there, but hauing some day left, passed on further. Passing ouer the Bridge of the Towne he met the Bayliffe with others, whom hee saluted, but they obserued him not. Being past the Bridge, making shew of stay for some other cause, hee turned backe toward 
Iuerdun,
 taking a diligent view of the Scite, defences, and state thereof, which was noted by them that were yet vpon the bridge, who thought hee did it onely for the marke of his way in trauell. But as he was gone a little further, the foresaid Dea∣con (being in a Garden) espied him comming a farre of: and obseruing his countenance began to suspect it might be 
Terrail;
 and to assure himselfe better, knowing that he was bald, made him a low congee to draw him to the putting of his hat, which he did; and the Deacon being now confirmed, ran presently to the Bayliffe, telling him what he thought.


All they which were by, hauing marked the coun∣tenance of 
Terrail,
 how he returned, and tooke sur∣uay of the place, wished the Bailife to send after him. He immediatly dispatched two, and gaue them in charge to obserue which way he tooke. If hee went from 
Burgoigne,
 they should returne without farther pursuite; If toward, they should follow him to his lodging, without making any shew to know him, but onely to be confirmed in the markes of his per∣son. There happened also, (as is assured for truth)

 another notable act, signe or argument of Gods pro∣uidence. 
Terrail
 hauing past the village of 
Villeboeuf,
 which is not aboue halfe a league from the way of 
Burgoigne,
 to lodge in the said county that night, pas∣sing ouer a slough, his horse stucke, so that hee was faine to turne backe, and goe ouer a planke, vpon which his horse stumbling, so that hee halted, hee was faine to resolue of lodging that night in 
Ville∣boeuf.
 Hee had no guide with him, that knew the Country, which was a great cause of his surprise; For a Guide might easily haue set him in the Coun∣try betweene 
Berne,
 and 
Friburge,
 which in some pla∣ces was not aboue two Harguebusse shot from him, and there he had beene in fafety, through the inter∣mixture of their iurisdiction. But at 
Friburg,
 hee had found all fauour, where his enterprises, had made them houer for aduantage against the 
Bernoys,
 vpon the great difference, which they haue had long for their land possest in common, and which the 
Fribur∣gers
 would deuide to the detriment of those of the re∣formed religion, which is onely exercised in almost al those places. After his taking he was very sory, and more when he knew how easily he might haue been saued by this meanes. Being come to the foresaide Village of 
Villeboeuf,
 the two that were sent from 
Iuerdun,
 hauing hous'd him carefully, one of them re∣turned with all speede to the Bayliffe, to giue him the notice, who sent presently foure hors-men, cōducted by the Captaine of the Castell of 
Iuerdun,
 to force him backe to the Bayliffe, and bad them strengthen themselues with the force of the Country. They at

 their arriuall in the morning found 
Monsieur du Terrail
 booted, and ready to take horse; to whom the Host, and other aduertised of the busines, decla∣red that he could not passe the Mountaines, for two great 
Corps du guard,
 that would let no man goe vn∣till hee had giuen accompt of his Voyage to the Bayliffe of 
Iuerdun.
 This was strengthened by the Horse that came that morning, at which 
Bastide
 began to shew a cursing dislike of the action, 
Terrail
 disposed of himselfe very peaceably, to returne to 
Iuerdun
 with these fiue or sixe Horsemen, whom with his people he might easily haue slaine, or made to quit him by flight, if he had foreseene his calamity. After his taking he repented himselfe much, that hee had not showne his great courage at this instant. But God blinded him, neither since hath beene noted in him any sparke of valour, and dexterity, whereby he might haue saued himselfe diuers times, as shall appeare in the sequell; Being returned to 
Iuerdun,
 and demaunded by the Bayliffe (a subtle and experienced man) what hee was? He said hee was a Gentleman of 
Dauphine,
 and cald 
Paule de Constans,
 and going to 
Lorraine
 to follow a sute, which con∣cern'd him nearely, and therefore desir'd the Bayliffe for present dispatch: which answers so slightly groū∣ded, made the Bayliffe more suspitious, so that hee resolued to seise him till hee were better informed, and demanded his sword, which he rendred him wil∣lingly, and was lodged in an Inne in 
Iuerdun,
 with a guard set vpon him of foure Men, day and night. Among other causes of suspition, being at 
Villeboeuf,


 and seeing that he must returne, hauing no meanes to escape, his people being taken by the multitude, he called for a Candle, with which he burnt a long Let∣ter writ of all sides; This being seene and demaun∣ded what it was, he assured them that it was a Letter writ to 
Madam de Criqui
 his Kinswoman, to inter∣cede for him to the King, and hath euer since to his end maintained it, and that he burnt it, least his name and quality should be knowne. The Bayliffe to assure himselfe, sent presently to 
Geneua,
 to haue some that knew 
Terrail.
 They immediatly sent one of the chiefe of the Towne, and a Souldier borne in 
Geneua,
 who had serued vnder 
Terrail
 in the Low Countries, & had giuen diuers aduises of this enter∣prise, which he had heard from 
Terrails
 owne mouth and sundry of his followers.


When these two arriued at 
Iuerdun,
 it was thought good, that the Souldier should come in vpon the so∣daine, where 
Terrail
 was at Supper; which hee did, and sate downe rudely; making no shew to see him, 
Terrail
 seeing him, was much troubled and changed colour, as if his heart failed him, fayning hee was not well, and required to haue his bed warmed, and with∣drew (being much out of temper) with his ordinary Guard to his Chamber, whither he caused the Soul∣dier to be called, and entertained him with very cour∣teous discourse, to enduce him to confesse, if he were not sent thither to discouer him: which the Souldi∣er affirming, he began to talke strangely to him: That he knew not what they of 
Geneua
 had to doe with him? that he had had diuers aduertisements in 
Cham∣beri,


 that they laid wait for him at 
Geneua,
 & that they would make vse of this souldier to discouer him: that he would die a braue Knight as he was, & innocent. That he had neuer had to doe with them of 
Sauoy.
 Then he began to practise with the souldier to helpe him to scape promising him 1000. crownes, 
Bastide
 offred him presently 100. crowns down, which he re∣fused. 
Terraill
 prayd him to come, & visite him eare∣ly in the morning: for hee had some great thing to tell him. In the meane time the Bailiffe aduertised of the truth, and finding it not good hee should dis∣course any longer with the souldier, sent to haue him brought to the Castle with his seruant, where they were seuerally lodged, and well guarded. After they knew at 
Geneua
 of his taking, they purposed to send to demaund him of the Lords of 
Berne,
 iudging that in their hands, they should hardly draw the trueth of the enterprise from him, and that mighty inter∣cessions, and other meanes might easily saue him. They sent therefore to 
Berne,
 one of the Syndicks of 
Geneua,
 who being first heard by the Councell of 25. at 
Berne,
 hee showed them the great and iust grounds, that they of 
Geneua
 had to desire, to haue 
Terrail
 in their hands, that they had proofes and cer∣tainties of his practises, that the witnesses which they had at 
Geneua
 could not without danger bee sent o∣uer, that it was the common cause of both the en∣leagued States, that the enterprises threatned an in∣separable blow, that those of 
Geneua
 in the like cases had deliuerd prisoners to the Seigniory of 
Berne,
 that very lately the Kings Garison had accorded a priso∣ner

 enterprising the like action, and that it would be of great consequence to diuert all enterprisers, if they saw, they could not with safety come about 
Geneua,
 nor the territories of the King, or their Lord∣ships of 
Berne.
 In the end the lesser Councell of 
Berne,
 finding themselues much perplexed, assembled the great Councell of 200. and the same things beeing proposed to them, it was with great clemencie con∣cluded by generall assent, that 
Terrail
 should bee gi∣uen into the hands of them of 
Geneua
 with his ser∣uant.


The Ambassador of the King, resident at 
Solurre,
 much approoued this resolution, fearing that hee could not bee enough assured in the hands of those of 
Berne.
 The newes of this grant being arriued at 
Geneua,
 they vsed the extreamest diligence and dex∣teritie, to perswade the Brother of the seruant of the Tennise-court keeper of 
Chamberi
 aboue named, to goe to 
Chamberi
 and winne his brother to come with faire promises, and pretexts, which hee execu∣ted faithfully and readily; so that within three dayes he was at 
Geneua,
 and serued infinitely to the Disco∣uerie. They also sudenly sent the Souldier which had knowen 
Terrail
 to 
Monlori
 hard by 
Lyons,
 where they knew there was a Souldier, who had bene som∣times, 
Terrail
 his Horse-keeper, and had heard the discourse touching the Enterprise of 
Geneua,
 and had oftentimes told it 
Beleine.
 (So was the name of the Souldier of 
Geneua.
) But the Horse-keeper was not there, yet at 
Lyons
 the foresaid 
Baleine
 found a Soul∣dier his 
Camerado,
 who assured him, that at diuers

 times the said Horse-keeper had told him all his bu∣sinesse, whereof 
Baleine
 tooke an ample and expresse Copie by the hand of a publike Notarie. Mon∣sieur du 
Terrail
 was deliuered to the Syndicke of 
Ge∣neua,
 and conducted by a strong Gard of 
Iuerdun
 to 
Morges,
 a little Towne scituate vpon the Lake 
Le∣man,
 eight Leagues from 
Geneua,
 and there was put to the Gard of the Bailiffe of 
Morges,
 till hee should be sent for to 
Geneua
 by water, which stay of him was made by the two hundred, till they recei∣ued a publike Acte vnder the Seale of 
Geneua,
 that this was done without consequence, or preiudice of their iurisdiction, of their proper grace and curtesie to their confederates.


Terrail
 was caried alone from 
Iuerdum,
 his Serui∣tour was left there, for feare they should Parlee, and practise together. By the way hee entertained the Syndicke with diuers desperate discourses; say∣ing from time to time, what Death will you put me to at 
Geneua?
 He shewed that hee was much afraid, they would deliuer him to the King; and for that had changd his Name and fashion; and that his feare was the King hauing him would keep him in the Ba∣stile. That if he were farre from him, he could make his peace to his great aduantage & libertie, but now he must stand at the deuotion of the King: Yet since, he hath affirmed, that his greatest desire was, hee might not fall into the hands of those of 
Geneua
 but might be sent to the King, hoping by his great Alli∣ance easily to make his peace. And since his com∣ming hither hath vsed greater cunning, giuing out

 that he disswaded the Duke of 
Sauoy
 in the Enter∣prise of 
Geneua,
 but with so friuolous reasons that we easily knew, they were Discourses built but to deceiue. He lulled the Bayliffe of 
Morges
 so asleepe with faire words and promises, that they with Sig∣neur 
D'esdiguieres
 sent to intercede for him to 
Berne,
 had free passage thorough 
Morges;
 and the Bailiffe of 
Morges
 refused to yeeld him to them, which should next Morning haue caried him by water to 
Geneua,
 and gaue 
Terrail
 good meanes to saue him∣selfe, if God had not left him destitute of his great courage and spirit. Hee had there also a very slender Gard, libertie to walke about all the Castle, meanes of Conference with whom hee would, and to write to his friends.


Hee got the fauour of the people there, by his good behauiour, iustification, and bountie: So that if but twentie resolute men had presented them∣selues, he might haue bene rescued, and the easier, in respect the Passage ouer, was but three small French Leagues; and the other Bank was wholly the Dukes. Nay, if he had had aduertisement but to come out of the Castle, he had beene safe by them of 
Morges,
 they were so much at his deuotion.


They of 
Geneua
 sent presently to 
Berne
 to com∣plaine, and re-enforce their request to haue him, which was confirmed with great indignation, and threatnings against the Bailiffe of 
Morges.
 The in∣tercession of 
Monsier D'esdiguieres,
 was very faint, and conditionall, as that if hee had not enterprised any thing against the King, or the Lords of 
Berne,
 or 
Ge∣neuâ:


 which made those of 
Berne
 the lesse hearkning. The Bailiffe of 
Morges
 before the answere to those of 
Geneua,
 receiued peremptory commaund to deli∣uer 
Terrail
 presently, which he was constrained to doe. Since, the Bailiffe was seuerely cited by a day to appeare in person at 
Berne;
 and it is held, that he is put already from his charge, and shal be from his ho∣nours, there being many presumptions, and some confessions of 
Terrail,
 that he was promised tenne thousand Crownes, if he so wrought, that hee might not be carried to 
Geneua,
 or at least that his man might not come there: which the foresaid Bailiffe had promised him, hoping by the meanes of his great credite, and kindred to make it good. The Pa∣pists Cantons and the kindred of 
Terrail
 trauelled earnestly at 
Berne
 to saue him. Some of them ariued too late. The Lords of 
Berne
 haue carried them∣selues very affectionately and zealously, in this busi∣nesse, moued thereto chiefly by the braues of those of 
Friburge,
 who with the wind of this enterprise had blowne vp their valours, but since are become slacke and supple. 
Terrail
 was caried by water in a Frigate, armed, and by the way, one of the Seigniors of the citie which accompanied him, made him very gra∣tious, and honorable offer; that if he would declare what might appertaine to the present assurance of their citie, he would promise him in the name of the Seigniorie, pardon, libertie, courteous vsage, and in∣tercession for him to the King. But he still denied all, though much troubled, and perplexed; saying, that he was no man to be tortured, that they ought not

 to offer him the racke; that he should then speake as well what was not; as what was. Being ariued at 
Geneua,
 the fourteenth of April, about midnight, they lodgd him in the Towne house well guarded. The next morning being sent for to the Councell, they againe bespake him very honorably, & opened vnto him, the power which they had to saue him, and re∣couer him to France; that hee should quit them of the paines of producing such things, as they had in their hands to conuince him, and should be aiding to himselfe; promising him all courteous entertaine∣ment, freedom, and mediation to the King. This was repeated more then sixe times. But stil he persisted to denie with great execrations, renouncing his part in Paradise, & in such manner, &c. So that in the end, it was told him, since hee would not bee good to him∣selfe, there was no more grace for him: and after that, made him answere as a 
Criminall,
 speaking to him rough, and harshly, which much amated him. Being confronted with the souldier 
La Baleine,
 hee denied all euen to the least things, and where al apparance made against him. Three dayes after his arriuall, His man was brought to 
Geneua,
 and pre∣sently led to the prison: whether 
Terrail
 was alrea∣dy remoued; In the morning the 15. of Aprill, 
Ba∣stide
 was showne to the yong fellow of the Tennis Court of 
Chamberi,
 from whom came the surest in∣telligence: who marking with good view his coun∣tenance, pronounced assuredly, that this was he that presented the foresayd paper to 
Terrail:
 and had held with him the discourse aboue mentioned: The

 yong man being asked apart what apparell 
Bastide
 had then on, told them, and 
Bastide
 confessed it to be true, but denied the fact of the paper, or any such cō∣munication, as also did 
Terrail.
 In the end, they per∣ceiuing the yong man constant to what he had said; it was resolued, that 
Bastide
 should be put to the tor∣ture, which was done. He bare two great ierkes of the strappado, at the third he confest all. This reso∣lution of putting 
Bastide
 to the torture, was also founded vpon this reason. A Citizen of 
Geneua
 ha∣uing by chance seene 
Bastide
 in the prison yard, affir∣med that he had supped one night with the said 
Ba∣stide
 in a village hard by, and that in the morning the hoste of the place told him, that this 
Bastide
 had drawne seuerall cards and plots of Fortification, be∣fore his departure; whereby he was knowen by the hoste for an Enginer: of which being then asked, he confessed it, and yet afterward in prison denied all stiffely. But now hauing confessed all, he was con∣fronted with 
Terrail,
 who began to discouer it. But 
Bastide
 perseuered in his affirmation, and 
Terrail
 was presented to the torture, wher, with teares in his eies, he confessed the whole fact voluntarily, and receiued no touch. His confessions concerned 
Geneua, Berne,
 the French King, and the States of the Low Coun∣try; but those concerning 
Berne
 and 
Geneua,
 were onely made publike: The King and the States were presently aduertised of that concerned them. First, the said 
Bastide
 confessed that he was an Enginer, and had long serued the Archduke; since, hee had giuen himselfe to 
Terrail,
 to execute his vndertaking. Hee

 had bin bred a Scholler, a braue fellow of his person, very subtill, and experienced in matter of fortificati∣on, and a cunning viewer of their weakenesses. He returned from his pilgrimage about foure or fiue mo¦neths since, with his master. Passing by 
Turin,
 the Duke of 
Sauoy
 had conference with them both about the towne of 
Geneua,
 to the surprise whereof they offered him their seruice, and for the following of this designe resolued to visite, and take view of the gates, the guardes, the water port, and whole state of the towne: whereupon 
Bastide
 vndertooke the go∣ing into the towne, and hauing viewed it all; repor∣ted the whole Plot of the Town, what was reformed in the fortification since the last 
Escalada:
 Following which, 
Terrails
 old Plot was altered; nor could 
Ter∣rail
 & 
Bastide
 agree on the meanes of the Enterprise.


Terrail
 inclining to the surprise of some port by 
Petard,
 or otherwise. 
Bastide
 vrged againe, that it was a matter of infinite hazard, for the great number of defences which are at the Gates, and the dilligence which they vse, and after some contest, the deuise of 
Bastide,
 was approued to take the way of the water port, which was not so well Guarded, and which being possest by a competent number, they might easily come vp to the hart of the Towne, without daunger, and the Entrie well executed, 
Bastide
 made no difficulty in the carying of the enter∣prise, being an easie thing to Sease on the water port, by reason of the nearenesse, and he did aduise to cast themselues into certaine narrow Lanes vnchay∣ned and couered ouer, which hereafter the Towne hath purposed to close vp for preuention of the like.




Terrail
 hauing heard all, yeelded himselfe to this aduise; and parted with 
Bastide,
 to passe himselfe ouer, to the other side of the Lake aboue at 
Euian,
 and staid there eight daies; informing himselfe particular∣ly of all the water men, which vsed to 
Geneua
 in great numbers, about the disposition, the Guides, and de∣fences of the water port, their searching of Boates, and other things pertaining to the Nauigation of the Lake, and learned many defaults in the Guard, and to be more assured sent 
Bastide
 to 
Morges
 to the end, that taking passage in one of the 
Barques
 of 
Gene∣ua,
 that on certaine daies goe thether to Market, hee might without suspicion at their returne obserue the whole state of the water port, and the landing place: which he so readily, and ably executed, that no man suspected him. Such a like spie was taken a∣bout two yeares ago, who had grossely tooke a view of the chaines; and being skared, and taken faltering in his answers, confessed (by Torture) that hee was sent to view the place, without knowing any other thing belonging to the enterprise, or so much as the man that sent him: for which he was taken to be one of 
Terrails
 party, and was hanged: since they haue re-enforced the port, with a ranke of double chaines, fifty paces from the first, but this would not serue to warrant against an enterprise like that of 
Sluce.


Terrail
 then, and 
Bastide,
 who returned to him by Land, hauing a new, viewed the water port by which he past, assured themselues of the certainty and facili∣ty of the businesse, and tooke vpon them, that they two would be the chiefe and leaders in the executi∣on. The Proiect was this, 
Geneua
 hath on the 
North


 side the Lake 
Leman
 which stretcheth it selfe in length at least fifty French Leagues; on the West side the Country of 
Berne;
 on the East side that of 
Sauoy;
 In the height of which there are great Moun∣taines, where growes great store of Wood, which the watermen of 
Geneua
 vsually bring home for fuell to their Towne, in great Flat Boates, and chiefely in∣tend this worke about the Moneth of May, in great troupes, the Wood being then dry which was felled the 
Autumne
 before. The designe of 
Terrail
 was to Sease foure or fiue of these great Boates, and to lodge couertly vnder the wood piled for the nonce, in each Boate, a hundred, or two hundred of those men, which might come in without any suspicion, the counterfait watermen, being clothed in the ha∣bite of ours: As for the search shuld be made at their entry, they cared not for it, being determined to leap out all at once, and kill. For the Muster of those troopes it should be in the Valleyes of those Moun∣taines, remoued from the commerce of the people of 
Geneua,
 & at the appointed time charge those Boates, with the rising and fauor of the Moone, which vseth to shine certaine dayes of that Moneth. 
Terrail
 was appointed to be in the first Boate, after the first onset was giuen, other troopes should bee ready of Knights and Gentlemen, which they might easily raise, vnder the pretext of the Mariage of 
Mounsieur Denemours,
 which was to be celebrated at 
Aneci
 in 
Sa¦uoy,
 sixe Leagues from 
Geneua,
 and though the defer∣ring and stoppe of this Mariage might cause some difficulty, yet they had such good incountry and op∣portunitie elsewhere, that they held the Action for∣infallible.

 The easinesse was this, that they might imbarque secretly hauing the winde fauourable to cary them in a quarter of the time, that was required by Land, the search was vsed to be made very negli∣gently, and within the Towne they had nothing to care for, the said search being made a good while after the Boates were arriued, fiue hundred men or more brought sodainely into the Towne, might easily giue worke to all the people, if they were possest but of a Canon at a Gate, and the water port, by which the Land-forces might enter in grosse and a flote. It was also designed in a season, when the Towne was vnfurnished of men by reason of the Hay haruest, and other businesse of the field, and in a time of the day very fitting, to wit, when they were all at Dinner, and the Towne very solitary. They haue also con∣fessed since their condemnation, that their voyage through the Country of 
Berne,
 was to Spy the Country, to pursue their victory after their surprise of 
Geneua.


Terrail
 went into the Low-Counrries to take his leaue of the Arch-duke, and bring away the rest of his goods, which he had there, and draw along with him a number of the best executioners, and watermen that he could get.


Terrail
 and 
Bastide
 agreed, especially in their con∣fessions, whereby it appeared that the chiefe ground of their enterprise proceeded from them; against which they haue since giuen very good preuentions for our safty hereafter, and also 
Terrail
 drew, on a paper with his owne hand, a deuise to warrant any Gates against a Petard.




Terrail
 requested that they would keepe him aliue betweene foure Walls, and that they would not cast away the Soule of 
Bastide
 by an extraordinary death. 
Bastide
 disposed himselfe to death with an incredible magnanimity, hauing very Christianly quitted all superstition, and liuely embracing whatsoeuer was propounded to him of the pure Doctrine of the Gospell. 
Terrail
 was condemned to bee beheaded, which was executed the ninth of Aprill, 
Bastide
 to be hanged, which was done on the Friday following being the 21. both executions were done within the City, in the place of 
Molard. Terrail
 dyed ve∣ry stoutly, without changing any whit his colour or countenance, and without any gesture vnworthy his life past; he desired that he might haue had his hands free: but the custome and feare of his courage denyed it, and gayned him great pitty. Hee shewed before his execution great piety, little mingled with superstition, the apprehension of which things hee put off, by the holy exhortations the Ministers made him, which he receiued with a peaceable and gentle Spirit, thanking God, who had giuen him time at his death to be conuerted to him, and meanes to ob∣taine pardon for his faultes; in cogitation of which he spent many teares, sighes, and prayers, dispising the rest, as death, the shame of his punishment, and the world, while they proposed to him comfort with all grauity, honour and comiseration possible, his teares made the standers by weepe, and forget all sinister desire of reuenge, Hee made his will, and be∣queathed twenty Crownes to the poore of 
Geneua.
 The day before his execution they receiued Letters

 from his mother adrest to him, in which shee com∣forted him, and assured him of the meanes they made for him in the Court of 
France,
 speaking still of his innocencie. 
Bastide
 edified more by his death, yet was exceeding sorie, that Torture had made him 
Terrails
 accuser, of whose death hee knew and wished hee had beene rather torne to pieces by foure Horses. There was no intercession made for 
Terrail
 in 
Geneua,
 but by 
D'esdiguieres,
 who was allied to him by his wife deceased, he sent his Secretary 
Mounsieur To∣nard,
 who vsed all meanes possible to haue changed the Sentence of death into perpetual imprisonment, but many vrgent reasons would not permit it, which they laboured to make the said 
Mounsieur du Tonard,
 and the Lord 
D'esdiguieres
 vnderstand by ample and honourable Letters. We vnderstood that the Mo∣ther of 
Terrail
 was comming, accompanied with diuers of the Nobility of 
Dauphine
 to mediate the same; But 
Mounsieur du Tonard
 meeting them at 
Remilli,
 told them he was already dispatched, where∣vpon they returned, sending only to intreat his body, which was in like maner denyed for great reasons be∣ing already buried in the Bullwarke, where the heads of those were interred that were slaine at the 
Escala∣da.
 He might haue made vse of the grace they pre∣sented him in the beginning, but he though that they could not conuince him, relying on the promises that the Bayliffe of 
Morges
 made him, that his man should not be deliuered into their hands, as indeede he was staid at the instance of that Bayliffe, till they made a second voyage for him. After they had pro∣ceeded

 against him with that exact seuerity, hee had no more meanes to saue his life, or bend them with importunity.


Solemne thanksgiuing was rendred for this deli∣uerance throughout all the Churches, the Sunday following being the 23. of Aprill. The 
Sauoyardes
 are much confounded; Some of 
Dauphyne,
 skou∣ring about 
Geneua,
 haue vsed great threates; but it is hoped, that when the King shall declare his will, it will stifle all these braues. There is good prouision had, against all future meanes of this enterprise, kee∣ping full Guardes vpon the first, and second chaines; of them that search all the Boates, which from hence forth shall come in single, and halfe an hower one after the other, and the wood so piled, as one may goe in, and see all that is in the boate. In summe, it is hoped that this Mine is vtterly blowne vp. 
Gene∣ua
 hath recouered great courage; and got no lesse reputation with the king, the Estates, and all the Churches of 
France,
 hauing made a notable essay of the ready, and entire affection of their Confederates the Lords of 
Berne.
