A free and abridged translation of "Voyage d'Espagne curieux, historique, et politique."  The authorship has been attributed to François van Aerssen, 1572-1641, and to his grandson François van Aerssen, 1630-1658.  The latter was the traveler, accompanied by Antoine de Brunel, who seems to have been the author (cf. Foulché-Delbose. Bibl. des voyages en Espagne et en Portugal, p. 63-65).
