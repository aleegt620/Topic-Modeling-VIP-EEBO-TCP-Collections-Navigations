¶ Syr Degore.














L
Ordynges and ye wyll holde you styll


A gentyll tale tell you I wyll


Of knyghtes of this countree


That hath trauayled beyonde the see


To seke auentures bothe nyght & daye


And how they myght theyr strengh assay


As dyde a knyght his name was syr Degore


One of the best that was founde hym before


Somtyme in Englonde there was a kynge


A noble man of maners in all thynge


Stoute in armes and vnder shylde


Full moche doubted in batayll and felde,


There was no man than veramente


That with hym Iusted in turmente


That out of his styrope myght brynge his fote


He was so stronge without doubte


The kynge had no chyldern but one


A doughter as whyte as whalles bone


That mayden he loued as his lyfe


Her moder was deed the quene his wyfe


In trauayll of chylde she dyed alas


But whan that mayden of aege was


Kynkes sones her woed then


Emperours Dukes and other men


To haue that mayden in maryage


For loue of her grete herytage


But than the kynge dyde them answere


That no man sholde wedde her


But yf that he myght with stoute Iustynge


The kynge out of his sadyll brynge


And downe hym lose his styropes two


Many one assayed and myght nought do




Euery yere of ryght it wolde


A grete feest wole he holde


Vpon his quenes murnynge daye


That was buryed in an abbaye


So on a daye the kynge wolde ryde


To an abbaye there besyde


To do dyryges and masses bothe


The poore to fede and the naked to clothe


His owne doughter with hym rode


And in the forest styll she abode


She called her chamberlayne her to


And other maydens she dyde also


And sayd adowne she muste alyght


Better her clothes to amende and ryght


Adowne they ben alyght all thre


Her damoysell and so dyde she


A full longe stounde there she abode


Tyll all the meyne frome her rode


They gate vp and after they wolde


But they coude not they ryght waye holde


The wodde was roughe and thycke ywysse


And they toke theyr waye all amysse


They rode southe they rode west


In to the thycke of that forest


And in to a londe they came at the last


Than weryed they wonder faste


Than wyst the well amysse they had gone


And downe the lyght euerychone


And they called all in fere


But there myght no man them here


The weder was hote before the none


They wyst neuer what was best to done




But layde them downe vpon the grene


Some fel on slepe as I wene


Thus they fell on slepe euerychone


Saue the kynges doughter alone


She went aboute and gadred floures


And to here the songe of small foules


So longe she dyde forth pas


That she wyst neuer where she was


y
e
 waye to her damoyselles she wolde haue nome


But she wyst neuer how to come


Than gan she crye wonder sore


She wepte and wronge her handes thore


And sayd alas that I was borne


For well I wote I am forlorne


For wylde bestes wyll me rynde


Or ony man may me fynde


And then she sawe a Ioyfull syght


To her came prekynge a fayre knyght


Full well he semed a gentyll man


And ryche clothes hym vpon


Well farynge both of fote and honde


There was non suche in that londe


So stout a man than was he


He sayd madame god you se


Be ye a drade of me ryght nought


I haue none armes with me brought


I haue the loued this many a yere


And now I haue founde the here


Thou shalte be my lēmanne or I go


Wheder it tourne to wele or wo


No more to done then coude she


But wepte and cryed and wolde haue fle




Anone began he her to be holde


And dyde with her what he wolde


And berafte her her mayden hode


And than before the lady he stode


He sayd madame gentyll and fre


With chylde I wote well that ye be


Well I wote it shall be a knaue


Therfore my swerde he shall haue


My good swerde of ameaunt


For therwith I slewe a gyaunt


I brake the poynt in his hede


And in the felde I it leued


Dame take it vp lo it is here


For thou spekest not with me this many a yere


And yet parauenture the tyme may come


That I maye speke with my sone


And by this sworde I may hym ken


He kyssed his loue and wente then


The knyght passed as he come


All wepynge the lady that swerde vp nome


She wente awaye sore wepynge


And founde her maydens slepynge


She hydde the swerde so as she myght


And called them vp anone ryght


And toke theyr horses euerychone


And began to ryde soone anone


And than ther came at the last


Many a knyght prekynge fast


Fro the kynge than were they sent


To were wheder they wente


They brought them in to the hye waye


And rode in fere to that abbaye




There was done seruyce and all thynge


With many a masse and ryche offerynge


And whan that seruyce was all done


And gan to passe the hye none


The kynge vnto his palays gan ryde


And moche people by his syde


Whan euery man was gladde and blythe


The lady soned many a sythe


Her baly waxed more and more


She wepte and wronge her handes sore


So vpon a daye she gan sore wepe


A mayden of hers toke good kepe


And sayd madame for charyte


Why ye do wepe ye wyll tell me


Mayden and I tell the before


And thou me wrey I were but lore


For I haue ben euer meke and mylde


And truly nowe I am with chylde


And yf ony man it vnder yede


Euery man wolde tell in euery stede


That my fader on me it wan


For I loued neuer other man


And yf my fader it may wete


Suche sorowe his herte may gete


That he shall neuer mery man be


For all his Ioye is layde on me


And tolde the damoysell all in fere


How the chylde was begoten on here


Now gentyll lady greue you nought


For styll it shall be forth brought


Shall no man it wytte certaynly


Truely madame but you and I




Tyme was come she was vnbounde


And delyuered both hole and sounde


A man chylde there was bore


Gladde was the lady therfore


The mayden serued her at her wyll


And layde the chylde in a cradyll


She wrapped hym in clothes anone


And was all redy for to haue gone


Yet was the chylde vnto the moder holde


She gaue it .xx. pounde of golde


And .x. pounde of syluer also


Vnder his heed she gan it doo


Moche it is that a chylde behoues


She put with hym a payre of gloues


Herlemman gaue her them in a stonde


They wolde elles on no womans honde


On chyldes nother woman they nolde


But on his moders handes they wolde


And bad the chylde no wyfe wedde in londe


But the gloues wolde on her honde


For they myght serue no where


Saue the moder that dyde hym bere


A letter with the chylde put she


With the gloues also perde


She knyt the letter with a threde


A boute his necke a full good spede


Than was it in the the letter wrytte


Who so it founde shulde it wytte


For crystes loue yf ony good man


This wofull chylde fynde can


Do hym be crystened of preestes honde


And to helpe hym to lyue in londe




With this syluer that is here


Tyll he may armes bere


And helpe hym with his owne good


For he is come of gentyll blode


And whan she had thus done


The mayden toke her leue full sone


With the chylde in the cradyll and all thynge


She stale awaye in the euenynge


And went her waye she wyste not whyder


Thrughe thycke and thynne in the breer


She wente all the wynter nyght


By shynynge of the mone lyght


Then was she redely ware anone


Of an hermytage made of stone


An holy man had there his dwellynge


And theder she wente without lesynge


And sette the cradyll at the dore


For she durste dwell no lenger thore


But turned agayne a none ryght


And came agayne the same nyght


The hermyte rose on the morowe tho


And his knaue also


Lorde he sayd I crye the mercy


For nowe I here a yonge chylde crye


This holy man his dore vndyde


And founde the cradell in the stede


He lyfte vp the shete anone


And loked vpon the lytell grome


Than helde he vp his ryght honde


And thanked Ihesu cryst of his sonde


He bare the chylde in to the chapell


For Ioye of hym he ronge the bell




And layde vp the gloues and the tresoure


And crystened the chylde with grete honoure


And in the worshyp of the trynyte


He called the chyldes name Degore


For Degore to vnderstonde it is


But thynge that almoost is lost ywys


As thynge that is almoost a goo


Therfore he called that chylde soo


The hermyte was an holy man of lyfe


He had a syster that was a wyfe


He sente the chylde to her full rathe


With moche money by his knaue


And badde she sholde take good hede


The chylde to nourysshe and fede


And this lytell chylde Degore


Vnto that cyte was I bore


The good man and his wyfe in fere


The chylde they kepte as it theyr owne were


Tyll it was .x. wynter olde


He waxed a fayre chylde and a bolde


Well taught fayre and kynde


There was none suche in all that ende


What tyme .x. yere was come and spente


Vnto the hermyte they hym sente


The hermyte longed hym for to se


Thenne was he a fayre chylde and fre


He taught the chylde of clarkes lore


Other .x. wynter withouten more


And whan he was of .xx. yere


He was a man of grete powere


There was no younge man in that londe


That myght stande a brayde of his honde




And whan the hermyte that dyde see


That he a man so stronge wolde be


A stalworthe man in ony werke


And of his tyme a well good clerke


He toke his florens and his gloues


That he had kepte sor hym in his house


But his .x. pounde that was sterlynge


was spente aboute the chyldes kepynge


The hermyte toke hym his lettre to rede


He loked therin that same stede


Syr he sayd for saynt charyte


Was this lettre made by me


Ye sone by hym that me deme shall


Thus I founde the and tolde hym all


He sette hym downe on knees full blythe


And thanked the hermyte many sythe


And sayd he wolde not rest in londe


Tyll the tyme he had his fader fonde


He gaue the hermyte halfe his golde


And the remenaunt vp he folde


He toke his leue and fayne wolde go


The hermyte sayd he sholde not so


To seke thy kynne thou mayst not endure


Without good horse and good armure.




¶ How syr Degore fought with a dragon in a fo¦rest and slewe hym.







SIr hermyte he sayd in dede


I wyll haue no other wede


But a batte in mi honde


Myn enemyes therwith to withstande


A full good sapelynge of an oke


On whome he sette therwith a stroke


Where he neuer so tall a man


Nor yet so good armure hym vpon


He wolde hym fell to the grounde


With that same batte in that stounde




The chylde kyssed the hermyte tho


And toke his leue for to goo


Degore wente forthe on his waye


Thrughe a forest halfe a daye


He harde no man nor sawe none


Tyll it was past the hye none


Thenne harde he grete strokes fall


That made grete noyse withall


Full soone he thought that thynge to se


To wyte what the strokes myght be


There was an erle bothe stoute and gay


He was come theder that same day


For to hunte for a dere or a doo


But his houndes were gone hym fro


Thenne was there a dragon grete and grymme


Full of fyre and also venimme


with a wyde throte and tuskes grete


Vpon that knyght fast gan he bete


And as a lyon thenne was his fete


His tayle was longe and full vnmete


Bytwene his hede and his tayle


Was .xxii. fote withouten fayle


His body was lyke a wyne tonne


He shone full bryght agaynst the sonne


His eyen were bryght as ony glasse


His scales were harde as ony brasse


And therto he was necked lyke a horse


He bare his hede vp with grete force


The breth of his mouth that dyde out blowe


As it had bene a fyre on lowe


He was to loke on as I you tell


As it had ben a fende of hell




Many a man he had shente


And many a horse he had rente


And to that erle harde batayll began


But he defended hym lyke a man


And boldely smote hym with his swerde


But of all his strokes he was not aferde


His skynne was harde as ony stone


Wherfore he myght hym no harme done


And whan the erle syr Degore se


Helpe syr he sayd for saynt charyte


And thenne answerde syr Degore


Full gladly syr and god before


whan the dragon of Degore had a syght


He left the erle and came to hym ryght


And the chylde that was so stronge


Toke his staffe that was longe


And smote the dragon so on the crowne


That in that wodde he fell downe


And then that dragon anone ryght


Smote the chylde with suche myght


With his tayle vpon the ryght syde


That downe he fell in that tyde


And he sterte vp anone full ryght


And defended hym with moche myght


With that staffe that was so longe


He brake of hym bothe fote and bone


That it was wonder for to se


He was so toughe he myght not deye


Tyll Degore one stroke at hym flonge


With his staffe that was so stronge


He smote hym on the crowne on hye


That he made his braynes out flye




And thenne the erle was glade and blythe


And thanked Degore many a sythe


And prayed hym he wolde with hym ryde


Vnto his palays there be syde


And there he made hym a knyght


And made hym good chere that nyght


Rentes tresoure and half his londe


He wolde haue sezyd in to his honde


Syr Degore thanked hym truely


And prayed hym of his curtaysye


To lette his ladyes before hym come


Wyues medens more and some


And also your doughter eke


And yf my gloues ben for them mete


Or wyll vpon ony of there hondes


Than wolde I fayne take my londes


And yf my gloues wyll not soo


Thenne wyll I take my leue and goo


All the women were out brought


That there aboute myght be sought


All the assayed the gloues than


But they where mete for no woman


Syr Degore toke vp his gloues anone


And also toke leue for to gone


The Erle was a lorde of gentyll blode


He gaue syr Degore a stede ryght good


And therto he gaue hym good armure


The whiche was both fayre and sure


And also a page his man to be


And an hakneye to ryde on truely


Syr Degore was glade and blythe


And thanked the erle many a sythe




He rode forthe vpon his waye


Many a myle vpon somers daye


Vpon a daye moche people he mette


He houed styll and fayre them grette


And asked a squyre what tydynge


And frome whens came all that folke rydynge


The squyre sayd syr veramente


They come frome the parlamente


Fro a counseyll the kynge dyde make


The whiche is for his doughters sake


But whan the parlament was moost plenere


The kynge lete crye bothe fer and nere


Yf ony man were soo bolde


That with the kynge Iust wolde


He sholde haue his doughter in maryage


And all his londe and herytage


It is a londe bothe good and fayre


And the kynge therto had none ayre


But sertes there dare no man graunt therto


Many one sayd they myght not doo


For euery man that rydeth to hym


He beteth them with strokes grym


Some he breketh the necke anone


Of some he cracketh bothe backe and bone


Some thrughe the body he glytte


And some to deth he smytte


And to hym may no man do nothynge


Suche a grace euer had our kynge


Syr Degore stode in a stody than


And thought he was a doughty man


And I am in my yonge blode


And I haue horse and armure good




And as I trowe a full good stede


I wyll assaye yf that I may spede


And yf I may bere the kynge downe


I may be a man of grete renowne


And yf that he me fell can


There knoweth no body what I am


Dethe or lyfe what so me be tyde


I wyll ones ayenst hym ryde


Thus in the cyte his ynne he takes


And rested hym and mery makes


So vpon a day the kynge he mette


He kneled downe and fayre hym grette


He sayde syr kynge of moche myght


My lorde hath sent me to you ryght


To warne you how it shall be


My lorde wyll come and fyght with the


To Iust with the my lorde hathe nome


The kynge sayd he shall be welcome


Be he knyghte or barowne


Erle Duke or chorle in towne


There is no man I wyll forsake


Who all may wynne all may take






¶ How syr Degore Iusted with the kynge of En¦glonde and smote hym downe.


S
O on the morowe the day was sette


The kynge auysed moche the bette


But thenne there was no lyuynge man


That Degore trusted moche vpon


But to chirche that tyme went he


To here a masse of the trynyte








To the fader he offered a floryne


And to the sone another fyne


The thyrde to the holy goost he offered


The preest in his masse for hym prayed


And whan the masse was done


Vnto his ynne he wente anone


He dyde arme hym well in dede


In ryche armure good at nede


His good stede he began to stryde


And toke his spere and forthe dyde ryde


His knaue toke an other spere


And after his mayster gan it bere


Thus in the felde syr degore a bode than


They kynge came with many a man


Many came theder redely


To se the iustynge truely


All that in the felde were


They sayd and dyde swere




That they neuer or that tyme se


So fayre a man with theyr eye


As was that yonge knyght syr Degore


But non wyst what man was he


They rode to gyder at the laste


On theyr good stedes full faste


The kynge had the gretter shafte


And more he coude of that crafte


To dasshe hym downe thenne had he mente


And in his shylde sette shuche a dente


That his good spere all to braste


But Degore was stronge and sat fast


Than sayd the kynge alas alas


For me befell neuer suche a case


There was neuer man that I myght hit


That euer myght my stroke sytte


This is a man all for the nones


For he is a man of grete bones


Thenne toke the kynge a gretter tre


And square also mote I the


And yf his necke wyll not a two


His backe shall or that I goo


The kynge rode to hym with grete randowne


And thought to haue dasshed the chylde downe.


He smote syr Degore soone anone


Ryght before the brst bone


That his horse was rered on hye


And syr Degore was fallen nye


Syr Degore thus his cours out yode


He was sore angry in his mode


Alas he sayd I haue myssed yet


And he hath me twyes hit




And neuer ones with hym I met


By god I shall me auyse bet


They rode togyder with grete myght


In theyr sheldes theyr speres pyght


That theyr good speres all to broke


Vnto theyr handes with the stroke


And than the kynge began to speke


Gyue me a spere that wyll not breke


For he shall anone be smyten downe


Thoughe he be as stronge as was sampsowne


And yf he be the deuyll of hell


I shall hym soone downe fell


The kynge toke a spere styfe and stronke


And Degore toke a nother good and longe


And stouly to the kynge he smytte


The kynge hym fayled and Degore hym it


And syr Degore soo hym bete


That he made the kynges horse torne vp his fete.


Boldely he rode vp than


And semed a full goodly man


The kynge was out of his sadyll caste


Wherof his doughter was sore a gaste


Thenne was there moche noyse and crye


The kynge was sore asshamed for thy


Wele I wote his doughter was sory


Fer thenne she wyste redely


That she shulde maryed be


To a man of a straunge countree


And lede her lyfe with suche one


That she wyste neuer fro whens he come


The kynge sayd to syr Degore


Come heder fayre sone me before




And thou were as gentyll a man


As thou semest to loke vpan


And thou coude wyt and reason doo


As thou arte doughty man to


I wolde thynke my londe well beset


And yf it were fyue tymes the bet


For worde spoken I must nedes holde


Before my barons that be so bolde


I take the my doughter by the honde


And sesse the in all my londe


To be myn heyre after me


In Ioye and blysse for to be






¶ How syr Degore wedded his moder the kȳges doughter of Englonde / and howe shewe knewe y
t
 he whas her sone by the gloues.






GRete ordynaunce was there wrought


To the chyrche dore they were brought


And were there wedded veramente


Vnto the holy sacramente


Loke what foly happened there


That he sholde wedde his owne modere


The whiche had borne hym one her syde


And yet he knewe nothynge that tyde


He knewe nothynge of her kenne


Nor she knewe nothynge of hym


And bothe togyder ordeyned to bedde


Yet parauenture they may be sybble


Thus dyde syr Degore the bolde


He wedded his moder to haue and to holde


God suffred moche thynge there


But yet he lete them not synne in fere


It passed on the hye tyme of none


And the daye was nere hande done


To bed was brought bothe he and she


With grete myrthe and solempnyte


Syr Degore stode and be helde than


And thought of the hermyte holy man


That he sholde neuer for thy


Wedde no Wedowe nor lady


But yf she myght the gloues two


Lyhtly vpon her handes doo


Alas than sayd syr Degore


The tyme that euer I was bore


And sayd anone with heuy chere


Me had leuer than all this kyngdome here


That is now sessyed in to my honde


That I were fayre out of this londe




The kynge these wordes harde tho


And sayd dere sone why sayst thou so


Is there ought ayenste thy wyll


Other done or sayd that dothe the yll


Or ony thynge that is mysdone


Tell me and it shall be amended sone


Naye lorde he sayd thenne


But for all the maryage that done hath ben


I wyll not with no woman mell


Wyfe wedowe nor damoysell


But yf she myght these gloues doo


Lyghtly vpon her handes two


And whan the lady gan this here


A none she changed all her chere


And all to gyder turned her mode


Her visage waxed rede as ony blode


She knewe that the gloues longed to her


And sayd gyue me the gloues fayre syr


She toke the gloues in that that stede


And lyghtly vpon her handes them dyde


She fell downe and began to crye


And sayd lorde god I aske mercy


I am thy moder that the dyde bere


And thou arte my owne sone dere


Syr Degore full sone tho


Toke her vp in his arumes two


Than were they glade and blythe


They kyssed to gyder many a sythe


The kynge of them had grete meruayll


Of the noyse they made withouten fayll


And was a basshed of theyr wepynge


And sayd doughter what is this thynge




Fader she sayd wyll ye it here


Ye wene that I a mayden were


Nay truely fader I am none


For it is .xx. wynter a gone


This is my sone god it wote


And by these gloues I it wotte


She tolde hym all togyder there


How he was begoten on here


Than bespake syr Degore


Swete moder than sayd he


Where is my fader wonnynge


And whan herde ye of hym ony tythynge


Sone she sayd by heuen kynge


I can tell of hym no tydynge


But whan thy fader frome me wente


A poyntles swerde he me lente


And charged me to kepe it than


Tyll the tyme thou were a man


She fette the swerde full swythe


And syr Degore it out twythe


Longe and brode it was perde


There was none suche in that countre


Truely sayd syr Degore than


Who so it owed he was a man


Now god of heuen he me kepe


Nyght nor daye I wyll not slepe


Tyll the tyme I may my fader se


In crystendome yf that he be


He made hym mery that ylke nyght


On the moro whan it was day lyght


He wente to the chyrche to here masse


And made hym redy for to passe




Than sayd the kynge my nexte kynne


I wyll gyue the knyghtes with the to wynne


Syr he sayd gramercy than


With shall go no other man


But my knaue that may take hed


To myn armure and to my stede


He lepte on horse the sothe to saye


And rode forth on his Iournaye


Many a myle and many awaye


He rode forth on his palfraye


And euer more he rode west


Tyll tyme he came to a forest


Wylde bestes there wente hym by


And foules songe there full merely


So longe he rode tyll it drewe to nyght


The sone wente doune and fayled lyght


Vnto some towne fayne wolde he ryde


But there was none on neyther syde


Soone after he founde a castell clere


A lady truely wonned there


A fayre castell of lyme and stone


But other towne there was none


Degore sayd to his knaue that tyde


Wyll we to that castell ryde


And all nyght abyde wyll we


And aske lodgynge for charyte


The drabryge was drawen tho


And the yate stode open also


Vnto the castell they gan them spede


And fyrst he stabled vp his stede


And than he set vp his hakeney


I noughe they founde of corne and hey




He wente a boute and gan to call


Bothe in the courte and eke in hall


Nether for loue nor yet for awe


Lyuynge man none there they sawe


And in the myddes of the hall floure


There was a grete fyre in that stoure


Than sayd his man leue syre


I haue wonder who made this fyre


Yf he wyll come agaye this nyght


I wyll hym abyde as I am knyght


He set hym done vpon the dease


And made hym well at ease


Than was he ware soone of one


That at the dore he gan gone


And thre maydens fayre and fre


That where trussed vp to the knee


Twayne of them bowes dyde bere


And two of them charged were


With venyson that was full good


Thenne syr Degore vp stode


And blessed them a none ryght


But they spake not to the knyght


But whente in to the cambre a none


And shytte the dore full sone


And a none after therwithall


There came a dwarfe in to the hall


Foure fote was the length of hym


His vysage was bothe grete and grym


And the hear that on his heed was


It was yelo as ony waye


But full stouly than loked he




He ware a cyrcote that was grene


With blaunchmer it was furred I wene


He was well clade and well dyght


His shone was corked as a knyght


He was large bothe of fote and hande


As ony man was in that lande


Syr Degore loked on hym tho


And to hym reuerence dyde doo


And he to hym wolde speke no worde


But made hym besy to lye the borde


He layde the clothe and sette forth brede


And also wyne bothe whyte and rede


Torches in the hall he dydde lyght


All thynge redy to souper he dyght


And sone after with grete honoure


There came a lady out of her boure


And with her came maydens fyftene


Some in rede and some in grene


Syr Degore folowed a none ryght


And nought she spake vnto that knyght


But yede and wasshed euerychone


And to souper gan they gone


The lady was fayre and bryght


In the myddes of the desse she set downe ryght


On euery syde sat maydens fyne


Fayre and goodly as ony was a lyue


By god than sayd syr Degore


I haue you blessed and ye not me


But ye seme dombe by saynt Iohan


I shall make you speke and I can


Syr Degore coude of curteysy


He yede and sat before the lady




And whan he had taken that sete


He toke a knyfe and cutte his mete


Full lytell mete at souper ete he


He dyde so be holde that mayden fre


Hym thought she was the fayrest lady


That euer afore he dyde se


All his herte thought and myght


Was on that lady that was to bryght


And whan they had souped all


The dwerfe brought water in to the hall


Thenne gan they wasshe euerychone


And than to chambre gan they gone


Truely quod Degore and after I wyll


To loke on that lady all my fyll


Who that me warneth he shall abye


Or to do hym make a sory crye


Vpon the stayre the waye he nome


And soone in to the chambre he come


They lady that was so fayre and bryght


Vpno her bedde she sat downe ryght


She harped notes swete and fyne


Her maydens fylled a pyece of wyne


And syr Degore sat hym downe


For to here the harpes sowne


That thorowe the notes of the harpe shyll


He layde hym downe and slepte his fyll


This fayre lady that ylke nyght


She bad go couer that gentyll knyght


And ryche clothes aboute hym caste


And the lady wente to a nother bed at the laste


So on the morowe whan it was daye


The lady rose the sothe to saye




And in to the chambre her waye gan take


She sayd syr knyght a ryse and wake


They lady sayd all in game


Ye be well worthy to haue blame


For as a beest all nyght thou dyde slepe


And of my maydens tokest no kepe


And than answered the knyght so fre


Mercy madame and forgyue it me


The notes of thyne harpe it made


Or elles the good wyne that I hade


But tell me now my lady hende


Or I out of this chambre wende


who hathe this castell in his honde


And who is lorde of this londe


wheder that ye be mayden or wyfe


And in what maner ye lede your lyfe


And why ye haue so many women


Alone withouten ony men


Syr fayne I wolde the tell


And thou coude it amende well


My fader was a bolde barowne


And holden a lorde of toure and towne


He had neuer chylde but me


I am ayre in this countre






¶ How syr Degore foughte for a lady with a gy∣aunt and slewe hym.







THere hathe me wowed many a knyght


And many a squyre well dyght


But than theyr wonned here besyde


A stoute gyaunt full of pryde


He hathe me desyred longe nad yore


And hym to loue may I neuer more


He is a boute with his mestrye


To do me shame and velonye


And he hathe slayne my men ychone


Saue my sory dwerfe alone


Ryght as they stode she fell to grounde


And soned there in that stounde


All her damoyselles to her come


To comforte her and her vp nome


The lady loked on syr Degore


Lefe dame thenne sayd he

And all my good I wyll the gyue


And all my body whyle I lyue


For to be at all your wyll


Erly and late loude and styll


And thy lemman for to be


To wreke me nowe on myn eneme


That was Degore fayne to fyght


For to defende that ladyes ryght


And to sle that other knyght


And wynne that lady that was so bryght


And as they stode bothe in fere


Her maydens came rydynge with heuy chere


She bad drawe the bryge hastely


For here cometh youre enemy


Or elles he wyll sle vs ychone


Syr Degore sterte vp anone


Oute at a wyndowe he hym se


He was sone armed on horse hye


So stoute a man as he was one


In armes sawe she neuer none


Syr Degore armed hym by lyue


And oure of the castell he gan dryue


And rode euen the gyaunt agayne


They smote togyder with moche mayne


That theyr good speres all to brast


Degore was stroge and sat fast


But his stedes bake braste a two


Thenne syr Degore fell to the grounde tho


And thenne he sterte vp and loughe




And his good swerde he out drughe


Than sayd the gyaunt to hym anone


On fote we wyll to gyder gone


Thou hast sayd Degore slayne my good stede


I hope to quyte the thy mede


To sle thy stede nought I wyll


But to fyght with the my fyll


And tho they fought on fote in fere


With stronge strokes on helme clere


The gyaunt gaue syr Degore


Houge strokes grete plente


And syr Degore dyde hym also


Tyll helme and basynet barste in two


The gyanut was a greued sore


Bycause he hadde his blode lore


He stroke vpon syr Degore soo


That to the grounde he made hym goo


Syr Degore recouered soone a plyght


And suche a stroke he gaue that knyght


And on the crowne soo it sette


That throwe his helme and basynet


He made the swerde go thorowe his het


And anone the gyaunt fell downe deed


The lady sat in her castell


And fawe all the holde batayll


How the gyaunt was slayne


That wolde her haue forlayne


She was as glade of that syght


As euer was bryde of the daye lyght


Syr Degore came to the caestll


Ano agaynst hym came that damoysell


She thanked hym of his good dede




And in her chambre she dyde hym lede


She sette hym on her bed anone


And vnarmed hym full sone


She toke hym in her harmes two


And kyssed hym .C. tymes and mo


And sayd all my good I wyll the gyue


And my body whyle I lyue


Gramercy damoysell then sayd he


Of that ye haue graunted me


But I must in to ferre contree


Mo auentures for to se


Vnto this twelue monthes be ago


And thenne I shall come you to


He betoke her to the heuen kynge


The lady wepte at his departynge


Syr Degore rode vpon his waye


Many a longe Iourney


And euer more he rode west


Tyll a lande he founde in a forest


To hym came prekynge a knyght


Well armed and on his horse dyght


In armes that wolde endure


With fyne golde and ryche asure


Thre bore hedes were theryne


They whiche were of golde fyne


As soone as euer he sawe that knyght


He spake to hym a none ryght


And sayd velayne what doost thou here


In my forest to sle my dere


Syr Degore sayd with wordes meke


Syr of thy dere I take no kepe


For I am auenturous knyght




That gothe to seke warre and fyght


His fader answered and sayd saunfayll


And thou be come to seke batayll


Thenne make the redy in a stounde


For thou haste thy felowe founde


And thenne syr Degore without daungere


Armed hym to fyght with his fadere






¶ How syr Degore fought with his fader & how his fader knewe hym by the broken swerde.




A Well godd helme for the nones


And well sette with precyus stones




It myght well be his owne saunfayll


For he wanne it ones in batayll


He kest his shelde aboute his swere


Of ryall armes good and dere


His good stede he began to stryde


He toke his spere and began to ryde


And his man toke an other spere


And by his syde he gan it bere


But loke what foly began that tyde


The sone agaynst the fader gan ryde


But neyther knewe other a ryght


And thus began they to fyght


Syr Degore had the greater shafte


And wonder well he coude his crafte


To dasshe hym downe than had he wente


And in his shelde gaue suche a dente


That his good spere all to brast


But his fader was stronge and sat fast


Another cours than haue they take


The fader for the sones sake


So harde they smote togyder in sothe


That theyr horses backes broke bothe


And thenne they fought on fote in fere


Wirh harde strokes on helme clere


And thus his fader a meruayled was


Of his swerde that was poyntles


And to hym sayd anone ryght


Abyde a whyle thou gentyll knyght


Where was thou borne and in what londe


Syr he sayd in Englonde


A kynges doughter is my moder


But I wote not who is my fader




What is thy name thenne sayd he


Syr my name is Degore


Syr Degore thou arte welcome


For well I wote thou arte my sone


By this swerde I knowe the here


The poynt is in my pautenere


He toke the poynt and sette it to


And they accorded bothe two


So longe they haue spoke togyder


Bothe the sone and the fader


That they be ryght well at one


The fader and the sone alone


Syr Degore and his fader dere


In to Englonde they rode in fere


They were bothe armed and well dyght


As it becometh euery knyght


They rode forth on theyr Iourney


Many a myle of that countrey


And on theyr way they rode full fast


In to Englonde they came at the laste


Whan they myght Englonde se


They drewe theder as they wolde be


Whan they wher to that palays come


They wher welcome all and some


And they behelde ouer all


The lady them spyed ouer a wall


And whan that lady sawe that syght


She wente to them with all her myght


And ryght well she them knewe


And than she chaunged all her hewe


And sayd my dere sone Degore


Thou hast thy fader brought with the




Truely madame than sayd he


Full well I wote that it is he


Now thanked be god than sayd the kynge


For nowe I wote without lesynge


Who is syr Degores fader in dede


The lady swoned in that stede


And sone after sekerly


The knyght wedded that lady


She and her sone was departed I twynne


For he and she were to nye of kynne


Forth thenne wente syr degore


With the kynge and his meyne


His fader and his moder dere


Vnto they castell they wente in fere


Where as dwelled that lady bryght


That he had wonne in fyght


And wedded her witth grete solempnyte


Before all the lordes of that countre


Thus came the knyght out of his care


God gyue vs grace well to fare


And that we all vpon domes day


Come to the blysse that lasteth ay.




AMEN
