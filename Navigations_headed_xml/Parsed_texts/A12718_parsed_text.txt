THE GENERALL OF GREAT BRITAINE.
CHAPTER I.


T
HE State of euery Kingdome well managed by prudent gouernment, seemes to me
to represent a Humane Body, guided by the soueraigntie of the 
Reasonable Soule:

the Country and Land it selfe representing the one, the Actions and State-affaires
the other. Sith therefore the excellencies of the whole are but vnperfectly laid o∣pen,
where either of these Parts is defectiue, our intendment is to take a view as well
of the outward Body and Lineaments of the now-flourishing British Monarchy
(the Ilands) Kingdomes and Prouinces thereof in actuall possession, (for with others, no lesse
iustly claimed in the Continent, we meddle not) which shall be the content of our first or 
Choro∣graphicall
Tome,
 containing the foure first Bookes of this our 
Theater:
 as also of its successiue go∣uernment
and vitall actions of State, which shall be our second or 
Historicall Tome,
 containing the
fiue last Bookes. And here first we will (by example of the best Anatomists) propose to the view
the 
whole Body
 and 
Monarchy
 intire (as farre as conueniently we could comprise it) and after will
dissect and lay open the particular Members, Veynes, and Ioynts, (I meane the Shires, Riuers,
Cities, and Townes) with such things as shall occurre most worthy our regard, and most behoue∣full
for our vse.


(2) The Iland of 
Great Britaine
 (which with her adioyning Isles is here first presented) contai∣neth
the Kingdomes of 
England
 and 
Scotland,
 and is of many accounted the greatest Island in the

World,
 though 
Iustus Lypsius
 giues that prayse to 
Cuba
 in 
America,
 as the Orientall Nauigatores doe
vnto 
Sumatra
 (taken for 
Ptolomees Taprobana)
 or to 
Madagascar,
 the Island of S. 
Laurence,
 both which
are neere vnto, or vnder the Equinoctiall line; In which we will not contend; as pleasing our selues














with her other prayses greater then her 
Greatnes;
 yet with this honour also, that it was (without que∣stion)
the greatest Island of the 
Romane World,
 and for any thing yet certainly knowne, of all the rest.
Concerning whose 
ositure in respect of 
Heauen, Lueretius
 (the first of the Latine Writers that names

Britaine)
 seemeth to place it in the same Parallel with 
Pontus,
 where he saith:

Nam quid Britannum coelum differre putamus, &c.


What differs Britaines heauen from that of Nile?


Or Pontus welkin, from Gadz warmer Isle?

In which, by a certaine crosse comparison, he opposeth two likes against two vnlikes, 
Britaine
 and

Pontus
 against 
Egypt
 and 
Gads.
 But to seeke into profound Antiquitie, rather then present practise,
for matters, in which 
Vse makes perfectnesse,
 were to affect the giuing light by shadowes, rather then by
Sunne-shine.


(3) It is by experience found to lie included from the degree fiftie, and thirtie scruples of La∣titude,
and for Longitude extended from the 13. degree, and 20. minutes, vnto the 22. and 50. mi∣nutes,
according to the obseruation of 
Mercator.
 It hath 
Britaine, Normandy,
 and other parts of

France
 vpon the South, the 
Lower Germany, Denmarke,
 and 
Norway
 vpon the East; the Isles of 
Ork∣ney

and the 
Deucaledonian Sea,
 vpon the North; the 
Hebrides
 vpon the West, and from it all other I∣lands
and Ilets, which doe scatteredly inuiron it, and shelter themselues (as it were) vnder the sha∣dow
of 
Great Albion
 (another name of this famous Iland) are also accounted Britannish, and are
therefore here described altogether.


(4) 
Britaine
 thus seated in the Ocean hath her prayses, not onely in the present sense, and vse of
her commodities, but also in those honorable Eulogies, which the learnedst of 
Antiquaries
 hath col∣lected
out of the noblest Authors, that he scarce seemeth to haue left any gleanings: neither will 

transplant them out of his flourishing Gardens, but as necessitie compels, sith nothing 

or other
 be
 said.



(5) That 
Britaine
 therefore is the Seas 
High Admirall,
 is famously knowne: and the 
Fortunate
Island
 supposed by some, as 
Robert
 of 
Anesbury
 doth shew: whose ayre is more temperate (saith 
Cae∣sar)

then 
France;
 whose Soile bringeth forth all graine in abundance, saith 
Tacitus;
 whose Seas pro∣duce
orient Pearle, saith 
Suetonius;
 whose Fields are the seat of a Summer Queene, saith 
Orpheus;

her wildest parts free from wilde beasts, saith the ancient 
Pa
gyricke,
 and her chiefe Citie worthily
named 
Augusta,
 as saith 
Ammianus:
 So as we may truely say with the royall 
Psalmist, Our lines are
fallen in pleasant places, yea we haue a faire inheritance.
 Which whatsoeuer by the goodnesse of God,
and industry of man it is now, yet our English 
Poet
 hath truely described vnto vs the first face there∣of,
thus;

The Land which warre-like Britaines now possesse


And therein haue their mightie Empire raisde,


In ancient times was saluage Wildernesse,


Vnpeopled, vnmanur'd, vnprou'd, vnpraisde.


(6) And albeit the Ocean doth at this present thrust it selfe betweene 
Doue,
 and 
Callis,
 diuiding
them with a deepe and vast entrenchment; so that 
Britaine
 thereby is of a supposed 
 made an
Iland: yet diuers haue stifly held, that once it was ioyned by an arme of land to the Continent of

Gallia.
 To which opinion 
Spencer
 farther alluding, thus closeth his Stanza.


Ne was it Iland then, ne was it paisde


Amid the Ocean waues, ne was it sought


Of Merchants farre, for profits thererem praisde,


But was all desolate, and of some thought


By Sea to haue beene from the Celticke Mainland brought.


 as a matter meerly coniecturall (because it is not plaine that there 
 Ilands nor hils


before 
Noahs
 floud) I leaue at large: 
Virgill
 surely (of all 
Poets
 the most learned) when describing
the Shield which 
Vulcan
 forged (in 
Virgils
 braine) for 
Aeneas,
 he cals the 
Morini
 (people about 
Cal∣lis)
the outmost men,
 doth onely meane that they were Westward, the furthest Inhabitants vpon the
Continent, signifying withall that 
Britaine
 as being an Iland, lay out of the world: but yet not out
of the knowledge of men, for the Commodities thereof inuited the famous Greeke Colonies of
Merchants, which dwelt at 
Massilia
 in 
France,
 to venture hither, as hath beene well obserued out of

Strabo.


(7) And as 
Iulius Caesar
 was the first Romane which euer gaue an attempt to conquer it, so will
we close its prayses with a late Epigram, concerning the outward face of the Isle, and the motiue
of 
Caesars
 comming.


ALBIONIS
 vertex frondoso cri
e superbit.


Arboreas frondes plurimas ales habet.


Graminean Montes & 
undunt paseua p
em;


Et carpunt, circum paseua, gramenoues:


Sed 
LATII
 caruit potioribus Insula donis,


Victori potior Gloria ni 
LATIO.


Albions
 high tops her woody lockes farre shew,


With quiers of chanting Birds these Woods resounding.


Her Downes and Meadowes cladin verdant hew,


Meadowes and Downes with flockes and heards abounding.


Latium
 had greater Wealth, yet 
Caesar
 thought,


To 
Brittish
 Glory, 
Latiums
 Wealth worth nought.



(8) The diuision of 
Britaine
 concerning the gouernment and Territories thereof; at such time

 
Ceaser
 here arriued, doth not sufficiently appeare. 
Caesar
 himselfe makes so sparing mention there∣in,
that we haue little cause to beleeue 
Florus,
 where he makes 
Lauie
 say, that after 
Caesar
 had slaine

 multitude of 
Britaines, he subdued the residue of the Ile,
 but rather with exquisite 
Hora
e,
 that
he did not at all touch them, as the word 
intactus
 doth in him purport.


(9) Kings they were, and therefore that diuision which was here in 
Caesars
 time, was into 
King∣domes;

the old names of whole Nations, as also the knowledge of their seuerall abodes, hidden vn∣der
the rabbish of so many ages, haue of late with infinite labours and exquisite iudgement, beene
probably restored and abounded; yet that no mans expectation and desire be too much frustrated,
reason wils that we briefly set forth such diuisions of the Land, as many repute not ancient onely,
but authenticke.


(10) Our seeming ancient Historians begin it at 
Brute,
 who to euery of his three sonnes gaue a
part, called presently after their names; as 
Loegria
 to 
L
rme
 his eldest sonne: 
Cambria
 to 
Camber

his second sonne; and 
Albama
 to 
Albanist
 his third sonne: And doubtlesse, if there had beene more
Nations of fame in this Iland, 
Brute
 should haue had more sonnes fathered on him: which conceit
some ascribe to 
Monmouth,
 holding that before him it was neuer so diuided.


(11) 
Ptolemie
 naming 
Britaine
 the 
Great
 and the 
Lesse,
 hath beene by some mistaken, as so diui∣ding
this Iland into two parts; but his proportion and distance from the 
Aequator,
 compared with
his Geographicall description will euince, that he calleth this our Iland 
Great Britaine,
 and 
Ireland
Britaine the Lesse.


(12) Howbeit some later doe make indeed the South and more Champion to be called 
Great
Britaine,
 and the North more Mountainous, 
Britaine the Lesse;
 whose Inhabitants anciently were
distinguished into the 
Maiatae,
 and 
Caledonij,
 and now by the 
Scots
 are into 
Heghlandmen
 and 
Law∣landmen.



But that 
Northerne
 clime being more piercing for the 
Romans
 constitutions, and 
lesse profi∣table
or fruitfull,
 they set their bounds not farre from 
Edenburgh,
 and altogether neglected the o∣ther
parts more Northward.


(13) This neerer part of 
Britaine
 they then diuided into two parts; for the more Southerne tract,
together with 
Wales, Dio
 termeth the 
Higher,
 and that more Northward the 
Lower,
 as by the seate
of their Legions doth appeare; for the second 
Legion Augusta
 (which kept at 
Caerleon
 in 
South-Wales)

and the twentieth called 
Victrix
 (which remained at 
Chester)
 he placeth in the 
Higher Britaine:
 but the
sixt 
Legion
 surnamed also 
Victrix,
 resident at 
Yorke,
 serued (as he writeth) in the 
Lower Britain;
 which
diuision, as seemeth, was made by 
Seuerus
 the Emperour, who hauing vanquished 
Albinus,
 Generall
of the 
Britaines,
 and reduced their State vnder his obedience, diuided the gouernment thereof into
two Prouinces, and placed two Prefects ouer the same.


(14) After this againe the 
Romanes
 did apportion 
Britaine
 into three parts, whose limits our 
great
Antiquary
 assigneth by the ancient 
Archiepiscopall
 Seates, grounding his coniecture on the saying of
Pope 
Lucius,
 who affirmes that the Ecclesiasticall Iurisdictions of the Christians, accorded with the
precincts of the Romane Magistrates, & that their Archbishops had their Sees in those Cities where∣in
their Presidents abode: so that the ancient Seates of the three Archbishops here, being 
London
 in
the East, 
Caerleon
 in the West, and 
Yorke
 in the North; 
Londons
 Diocesse (as seemeth) made 
Britaine
prima; Caerleon, Britaine secunda;
 and 
Yorke, Maxima Caesariensis.


(15) But in the next age, when the power of their Presidents began to grow ouer-great, they a∣gaine
diuided 
Britaine
 into fiue parts, adding the three former 
Valentia
 and 
Flauia Caesarie
sis:
 the
first of which two seemeth to haue beene the Northerly part of 
Maxima Casarie
sis,
 recouered from
the 
Picts
 and 
Scots
 by 
Theodosius
 the Generall, vnder 
Valence
 the Emperour, and in honour of him,
named 
Valentia:
 and 
Flauia
 may be coniectured to receiue the name from 
Flauius
 the Emperour
(sonne of 
Theodosius)
 for that we reade not of the name 
Britaine Flauia,
 before his time.



(16) So these fiue partitions had their limits assigned after this manner: 
Britaine prima
 contained
those coasts that lay betwixt 
Thamesis,
 the 
Seuerne,
 and the 
British Sea: Britaine secunda
 extended from

Seuerne
 vnto the 
Irish
 Seas, containing the Country that we now call 
Wales: Flauia Caesariensis,
 was
that which lay betwixt the Riuers 
Humber
 and 
Tyne:
 and 
Valentia
 from the said Riuer, and 
Picts wall

reached vnto the Rampire neere 
Edenburgh
 in 
Scotland,
 the farthest part that the 
Romanes
 possessed
when this diuision was in vse. For the seuerall people inhabiting all those parts, with their ancient
Names & Borders (whether designed by the 
Romans,
 or the old 
Britaines)
 together with our moderne

Names
 and 
Shires,
 answerable to each of them: we will referre you to the Tables thereof elsewhere.


(17) This whole Prouince of 
Britaine,
 as in our History shall appeare, was highly esteemed of the
Emperours themselues, assuming as a glorious surname 
Britanicus:
 comming thither in person o∣uer
those dangerous and scarce knowne Seas; here marrying, liuing, and dying; enacting here Lawes
for the whole Empire, & giuing to those Captaines that serued here, many Ensignes of great honor;
yea 
Claudius
 gaue 
Plantius
 (the first Prefect of that Prouince) the right hand, as he accompanyed
him in his Triumph: and his owne Triumph of 
Britaine
 was set out with such magnificence, that the
Prouinces brought in golden Crownes of great waight, the Gouernours commanded to attend, and
the very Capt
ines permitted to be present at the same: A Nauall Coronet was fixed vpon apinna∣cle
of his Pallace, Arches and Trophees were raysed in 
Rome,
 and himselfe on his aged knees moun∣ted
the staires into the Capitoll, supported by his two sonnes in Law: so great a ioy conceiued he in
himselfe for the Conquest of some small portion of 
Britaine.


(18) How the 
Romans
 found it, held it, and left it, as times ripened and rottened their successe, with
the Names, the Inhabitants, Manners & Resisters, I leaue to be pursued in the following Histories:
and will onely now shew thee these three Kingdomes, that are (in present) the chiefe Bodies of

Great Britaines Monarchie;
 two of which 
(Scotland
 and 
Ireland)
 shall in their due places haue their
farther and more particular Descriptions.













ENGLANDS GENERALL DESCRIPTION.
CHAPTER II.


THE 
Saxons
 glory now neere to expire, by his appointment who holdeth both times and
Kingdomes in his all ordering hand; their owne Swords being the Instruments, and the

Danes
 the maules that beat their beautifull Diadem into pieces; the 
Normans,
 a stirring Na∣tion,
(neyther expected, nor much feared) vnder the leading of 
William
 their Duke, and en∣couragement
of the 
Romane
 Bishop (an vsuall promoter here of broken titles) made hither
sodainly into 
England,
 who in one onely battell, with the title of his sword and slaughter or 
Herold,
 set
the Emperiall Crowne thereof vpon his owne head: which no sooner was done, but the 
English
 went
downe, and the 
Normans
 lording it, became 
Owners of those Cities which themselues neuer built; possessed
those Vineyards which they neuer planted; dranke of those Wells which they neuer had digged; and inhabitted
those houses, filled with riches, for which they neuer had laboured:
 for they found it to be as 
the land
whereupon the Lord set his eye, euen from the beginning to the end of the yeare:
 not onely 
drinking water
of the raine of heauen,
 but hauing also 
riuers of waters and fountaines in her valleyes, and without all scar∣sitie,
whose stones are yron, and out of whose mountaines is digged brasse.
 This made them more resolute
at first to settle themselues in this fairest and fruitfullest part of the Iland; the Conquerour vsing all
policie both Martiall and Ciuill, to plant his posteritie here for euer. How he found the Land go∣uerned
we shewed in the 
Heptarchy;
 but his restlesse thoughts were not contented with conquering
the Nation and their Land, vnlesse he also ouercame their very 
Customes, Lawes,
 and 
Language.


(2) Touching the distribution of the Kingdome, whereas other Kings before him made vse of
it, chiefly for the good of the people, and better ministring of Iustice, he made vse of it, to know the
wealth of his Subiects, and to enrich his Coffers: for 
he caused a description to be made of all England,



how much land euery one of his Barons possessed, how many Knights fees, how many Plow. lands, how ma∣ny
in villenage, how many head of beasts, yea how much money euery man from the greatest, to the
least did possesse, and what rents might be made of entry mans 
possession,
 the Booke of which inquisition
(yet in the Exchequer) was called 
Domesday,
 for the generalitie of that Iudgement on all the Land:
Whereunto we may adde his other distribution of this Land (worse then any former) when 
thrusting
the English out of their possessions, he distributed their inheritances to his Souldiers; yet so, that all should be
held of the King, as of the onely true Lord and possessor.


(3) For the Lawes by which he meant to gouerne, he held one excellent rule and purpose, which
was, that 
a People ought to be ruled by Lawes written and certaine:
 for otherwise new Iudges would
still bring new Iudgements: and therefore he caused 
twelue to be chosen out of euery Countie, which
should on their oath, without inclining one way or other, neither adding nor detracting, open vnto him all
their ancient Lawes and Customes.
 By whose relation vnderstanding that three sorts of Lawes former∣ly
were in the Land, 
Merchenlage, West Saxonlage, Danelage;
 he had preferred these last, (himselfe
and people being anciently deriued from those Northerne people) had not all the Barons beway∣ling
to the King, 
how grieuous it was for a Land to be iudged by those Lawes which they vnderstood not,
altered his resolute purpose:
 yet in bringing in the strange formes of 
Norman
 Processe, and pleading in
the 
French
 tongue (which continued till 
Edward
 the thirds time,) that grieuance was but slenderly
preuented. So likewise did he much alter the old Courts of Iustice, where these Lawes should be
ministred: but whereas the ancient Kings of 
England,
 according to 
Moses
 his example, sate in person
in the seate of Iustice, to right the greater affayres of their Subiects, as 
William La
bert
 sheweth in
King 
Alfred, Edgar, Canutus, &c.
 and proues out of the Kings Oath, out of 
Bracton, Britaine, Saxon
Lawes, &c.
 King 
William
 not onely continued this; but besides erected some other Courts of Iu∣stice,
as the Exchequer, and certaine Courts and Sessions to be held foure times euery yeare: ap∣pointing


both Iudges (some to heare causes, others to whom appeales should be made, but none
from them) and also 
Prefects to looke to good orders.
 Those last 
Polydor
 calleth 
Iustices of Peace;
 but
their institution seemes to be farre later: and no lesse is his errour on the other side, in saying the
Conquerour first instituted Sheriffes, and the tryall by twelue men, which were both ancienter.


(4) And because the Conquerour, for honour of Bishops, caused them to remoue from small
obscure places to Cities of more renowne; we haue therefore reserued to this last place that diuision
of this Kingdome, which is according to 
Iurisdiction Episcopall.
 Formerly in the yeare of saluation,
636 
Honorius
 the fift Archbishop of 
Canterbury,
 first diuided 
England
 into Parishes, which at this
day are contained vnder their seuerall 
Dio
sans,
 and these againe vnder their two

Yorke)

(5) To speake nothing of these twentie-eight Flamins the Priests of Idolatry, and the three
Arch-Flamins, whose seates were at 
London, Caerlion,
 and 
Yorke;
 all of them conuerted by King 
Lu∣cius

into Christian Bishops Sees: let vs onely insist vpon the three last, by the same King appointed
to be Metropolitanes ouer the rest; among whom 
London
 is said to be chiefe: whose first Christian
Arch-bishop was 
Thean,
 the builder of S. 
Peters
 Church in 
Cornehill
 for his 
Cathedrall,
 as by an ancient
Table there lately hanging, was affirmed, and tradition to this day doth hold. Our 
British
 Histori∣ans
doe bring a succession of fifteene Arch-bishops, to haue sate from his time vnto the comming of
the 
Saxons,
 whose last was 
Vodius,
 slaine by King 
Vortiger,
 for reprehending his heathenish marriage
with 
R
w
n,
 the Daugher of 
Hengist.
 At what time began the misery of the Land, and of holy Reli∣gion,


both which they layd wast vnder their prophane feete: vntill 
Ethelbert
 of 
Kent,
 the first Chri∣stian

Saxon
 King, aduanced Christainitie, & 
Augustine
 to the Arch-bishopricke of 
Canterbury,
 when

London
 vnder 
Melitus
 became subiect to that See.


(6) At 
Caerlion
 vpon 
Vske,
 in the time of great 
Arthur,
 sate 
Dubritius,
 a man excellently learned,
and of an holy conuersation: he had sate Bishop of 
Landaffe
 a long time, and with 
Germanus
 and 
Lu∣pus,

two 
French
 Bishops greatly impugned the Pelagian Heresie, infecting at that time the Iland ve∣ry
farre, whose fame and integritie was such, that he was made Arch-bishop of all 
Wales:
 but growne
very old, he resigned the same vnto 
Dauia
 his Disciple, a man of greater birth, but greater austeritie
of life, who by consent of King, 
Arthur,
 remoued his Arch-bishops See vnto 
Meneuia,
 a place very
solitary and meete for meditation: the miracles of the man, (which are said to be many) changed
both the name of the place into his owne, and robbed 
Caerlion
 of her Archiepiscopall seate: This
See of S 
Dauids,
 (as in an ancient Register belonging to that Church is recorded) had seauen Bi∣shops
Suffraganes subiect vnto it which were 
Exceter, Bathe. He eford, Landaffe, Bangor, S. Asaph,

and 
e
nes
 in 
Ireland:
 notwithstanding, eyther for want of Pall, carried into 
Britanny
 by Arch-bi∣shop

Sam
son,
 in a dangerous infection of sicknesse, either by pouertie or negligence, it lost that Iu∣risdiction,
and in the dayes of King 
Henry
 the first, became subiect to the See of 
Canterbury.


(7) 
Yorke
 hath had better successe then eyther of the former, in retayning her originall honour,
though much impaired in her circuit, challenging to haue beene some time Metropolitane ouer all
the Bishops in 
Scotland:
 and although it was made equall in honour and power with 
Canterbury,
 by
Pope 
Gregory,
 as 
Beda
 relateth; and had twelue Suffragan Bishoprickes that owed obedience, onely
foure now acknowledge 
Yorke
 their Metropolitane, but 
Canterbury
 the Superiour: for 
William
 the
Conquerour thinking it dangerous to haue two in like authoritie, least the one should set on his
Crowne, and the other strike it off, left 
Yorke
 to be a Primate, but 
Canterbury
 onely the Prin
 of
all 
England.



(8) The 
Lichfield
 was made an Archiepiscopall See by Pope 
Hadrian
 the first, at the suit of 
Offa,

the great King of 
Mercia,
 is manifested by 
Mathew
 of 
Westminster,
 vnto whose Iurisdiction were as∣signed
the Bishoprickes of 
Winchester, Hereford, Leicester, Sidnacester, Helm
am,
 and 
Dunwich,
 and
whose first and last bishop was 
Aldwin.
 That 
Winchester
 also had intended an Archiepiscopall
Pall, the same Author recordeth, when 
Henry Bloys,
 of the bloud royall, greatly contended with the
Arch bishop of 
Canterbury
 for superioritie, vnder the pretence of being Cardinall 
de latere;
 to him
an Archiepiscopall Pall was sent, with power and authoritie ouer seauen Churches, but he dying be∣fore
that the designe was done, the See of 
Winchester
 remained in subiection to 
Canterbury.
 And that
(long before) the See of 
Dorchester
 by 
Oxford,
 had the Iurisdiction of an Arch-bishop, is apparant
by those Prouinces that were vnder his Diocesse, which were 
Winchester, Oxford, Lincolne, Salisbury,
B
estow, Wells, Lichfield, Chester,
 and 
Excester;
 and the first Bishop of this great circuit, 
Berinu
,
 was
called the Apostle and Bishop of the West-
Saxons:
 which in his next successor was diuided into two
parts, 
Winchester
 and 
Dorchester,
 and not long after into 
Lichfield, Sidnacester,
 and 
Legecester;
 and
lastly, the See remoued from 
Dorchester
 to 
Lincolne,
 as now it is And thus farre for the diuision of
this Realme, both Politicke and Ecclesiasticke, as it hath stood and stands at this day.


(9) But the whole Ilands diuision, by most certaine Record was anciently made, when 
Iulius
Agric
la
 drew a trench or fortification vpon that narrow space of ground betwixt 
Edenbrough Frith,

and 
Dunbretton Bay,
 making the Southerne part a Prouince vnto the Romane Empire. Afterwards

Hadrian
 the Emperour seeing perhaps the Prouince too spacious to be well gouerned without great
expense, drew backe these limits almost fourescore miles shotter, euen to the mouth of the Riuer

Tyne,
 whence he fortified with a wall of admirable worke vnto 
Carlile,
 which stood the Lands bor∣der,
while it stood as a 
Romane
 Prouince: yet the conquering 
Saxons
 did spread againe ouer those
bounds, and (as seemeth) enlarged their gouernment to that first Tract, as by this inscription in
a Stone Crosse, standing vpon a Bridge ouer the water of 
Frith,
 appeareth.




I am a free March as Passengers may ken,


To Scots, to Britaines, and to Englishmen.


(10) But afterward 
William
 the Conquerour, and 
Malcolme
 King of 
Scotland,
 falling to an a∣greement
for their limits, arreared a Crosse vpon Stanemore, where on the one side the portraiture
and Armes of the King of 
England
 was sculptured, and of the King of 
Scots
 on the other (a piece
whereof is yet remaining there neere to the Spittle) thence called the Rev-Crosse, there erected
to be a Meare-stone to either Kingdome. His successors also abolished the two partitions in the
West, whereby the 
Welsh
 became one Nation and Kingdome with the 
English
 It is also said that
King 
Stephen
 to purchase friendship with the 
Scottish Nation,
 gaue vnto their King the Countie of

Cumberland
 who with it held both 
Westmorland
 and 
Northumberland;
 but as 
Newbrigensis
 writeth,
he restored them to King 
Henry
 the second, wisely considering his great power and right to those
parts.


(11) The last knowne borders were from the 
Sulway
 in the West bay, along the Cheuiot hills,
vnto the water of 
Tweed
 by 
Barwicke
 in the East, no maintaine which, on each part many Lawes
haue beene made, and many inrodes, robberies, and fewdes practised; all which by the hand of God
is now cut off, and by the rightfull succession of King IAMES our Soueraigne, who hath bro∣ken
downe the partition of this great Island, and made the extreames of two Kingdomes, the very
midst of his great vnited Empire.













KENT.
CHAPTER III.


KENT, the first Prouince appearing in the South of this Kingdome, is bounded vpon the
North with the famous Riuer 
Thamisis:
 on the East with the 
Germane Ocean:
 on the South
with 
Sussex
 and the narrow Seas: and vpon the West and 
Sussex
 and 
Surrey.
 The length
thereof extended from 
Langley
 in the West, vnto 
Ramsgate
 Eastward in the Isle of 
Thanet,
 is
about 53. English miles. From 
Rother
 in the South, vnto the Isle of 
Graine
 Northward, the
bredth is not much aboue 26. and the whole circumference about 160. miles.


(2) Informe it somewhat resembleth the head of a hammer or Battle-axe, and lyeth corner-wise
into the Sea: by 
Strabo, Caesar, Diadorus,
 and 
Ptolemie,
 called 
Cantium,
 of 
Cant
 or 
Angle
 or

Corner:
 either of 
Caine
 a 
British
 word, which signifieth 
Bushes
 or 
Woods,
 whereof that Countie in those
former times was plentifully stored.


(3) The ayre, though not very cleere, because of the vapours arising from the Sea, and Riuer:
that enuiron the same, is both wholesome and temperate, as seated neerest to the 
Equino
ticall,
 and the
furthest from the 
North Pole,
 not touched with cold as the other parts of the Land are.


(4) The soile towards the East is vneuen, rising into little hils, the West more leuell and woody,
in all places fruitfull, and in plentie equals any other of the Realme, yea, and in some things hath
the best esteeme: as in Broad-clothes, Fruits, and feedings for Cattell. Onely Mines (except Iron)
are wanting: all things else deliuered with a prodigall heart and liberall hand


(5) Sundry nauigable Riuers are in 
Kent,
 whereof 
Medwey,
 that diuideth the shire in the midst,
i
 chiefe; in whose bosome securely rideth his Majesties 
Nauy Royall,
 the walls of the Land, and ter∣rours
of the Seas; besides ten others of name and account, that open with twenty Creeks and Ha∣uens


for Ships arriuage into this Land, foure of them bearing the name of 
Cinque Po
t
,
 are places
of great strength and priuiledges, which are 
Do
er Sandwich, Rumney,
 and 
Winchelsey:
 among which

Douer
 with the Castle is accounted by 
Mathew Paris
 the Monke, the locke and key to the whole
Realme of 
England;
 and by 
Iohn Rosse
 and 
Lidgate
 is said to be built by 
Iulius Caesar,
 fatall onely for
the death of King 
Stephen,
 and surrender of King 
Iohn
 therein hapning.


(6) A conceit is, that 
Goodwin Sands
 were sunke for the sinnes of himselfe and his sonnes.
Shelues indeed that dangerously lye on the North east of this Countie, and are much feared of all

Nauigators.
 These formerly had beene firme ground, but by a sodaine inundation of the Sea were
swallowed vp, as at the same time a great part of 
Flanders
 and the 
Low Countries
 were: and the like
also at the same time befell in 
Scotland,
 as 
Hector Boetius
 their 
Historiographer
 writeth A like accident
hapned in the yeare 1586 the fourth day of 
August,
 in this Countie, at 
Mottingham,
 a Towne eight
miles from 
London,
 sodainly the ground began to sinke, and three great Elmes thereon growing,
were carryed so deepe into the bowels of the earth, that no part of 
 could any more be seene,
the hole left in compasse fourescore yards about, and a line of fiftie fadomes plummed into it doth
finde no bottome.


(7) The Kentish people in 
Caesars
 time were accounted the ciuillest among the 
Britaines:
 and
as yet esteeme themselues the freest Sub
cts of the 
English,
 not conquered, but compounded with
by the 
Normans:
 and herein glory, that their King and Commons of all the 
Saxons
 were the first
Christians, conuerted in 
Anno
 596. yea, and long before that time also 
Kent
 receiued the faith: for it
is recorded that 
Lucius
 the first Christian 
British
 King in this Iland, built a Church to the name and
seruice of Christ, within the Castle of 
Douer,
 endowing it with the Tolle of the same Hauen.


(8) This Countie is enriched with two Cities and Bishops Sees, strengthened with 27. Ca∣stles,
graced with 8. of his Majesties most Princely Houses, traded with 24. Market-Townes, and


beautified with many stately and gorgeous buildings The chiefest Citie thereof, the Metropolitan
and Arch bishops See, is 
Canterbury,
 built (as our 
British Historians
 report) 900. yeares before the
birth of Christ; by 
Henry
 of 
Huntington,
 called 
Caier Kent,
 wherein (as M. 
Lambard
 saith) was e∣rected
the first Schoole of professed Arts and Sciences, and the same a patterne vnto 
Sigibert
 King
of the 
East-Angles,
 for his foundation at 
Cambridge:
 notwithstanding by the computation of time,
this 
Sigibert
 was slaine by 
P
n
a
 King of 
Mercia,
 thirtie yeares before that 
Theodore
 the 
Grecian
 was
Bishop of 
Canterbury,
 who is said to be the 
ector of that Academie. But certaine it is, that 
Aust

the Monke had made this Citie famous before that time, by the conuersion of these 
Saxons
 vnto
Christianitie, and in building a most magnificent Church to Gods seruice, wherein eight of their
Kings haue beene interred, but all their Monuments since ouer shadowed by the height of 
Beckets

Tombe, that for glory, wealth, and superstitious worships, equalized the 
Pyramides
 of 
A
gypt,
 or
the 
Oracle
 of 
Delphos,
 yet now with 
Dagon
 is fallen before the 
Arke of God.


This Citie hath beene honoured with the presence and Coronations of King 
I
hn
 and Queene 
I∣sabell

his wife, with the marriages of King 
Henry
 the third, and of King 
Edward
 the first, and with the
interments of 
Edward
 the 
Bl
ke P
ince,
 King 
Henry
 the fourth, and of Queene 
 his wife: as 
Fe∣uersham

is with the burials of King 
Stephen,
 and of 
Maud
 his Queene and wife But as in glory so in
aduersitie hath this Citie borne a part, being d
ers times affl
cted by the 
Danes,
 but most especially
in the dayes of King 
Eth
red,
 who in that r
uenge of their massacre made hauock of all, and here∣in
slew forty three thousand and two hundred persons, the tenth besides reserued to liue. Afterward
it recouered breath and beautie by th
 liberalitie of B
shop 
; Charters and 
 by
King 
Henry
 the third; strength in Trench and Fortifications from king 
Richard
 the second; and
lastly, Wals for her defence by 
Simon Sudbury
 Arch-bishop of that See: whose Gradu
tion is pla∣ced
for Latitude 51. 25. and parallelized for Longitude 22 8. her sister 
Rochester
 differing not much
in either degree.



(9) Which Citie (as 
Beda
 saith) was built by one 
Rof,
 Lord of the same, though some ascribe
the foundation of the Castle 
Iulius Caesar,
 and hath beene often ruinated by the iniuries of warre,
both in the times when the 
Saxons
 stroue for superioritie among themselues, wherein this Citie was
layd waste, 
Anno
 680. as also in the assaults of their common enemy the 
Danes,
 who about the yeare
884. from 
France
 sailed vp the Riuer 
Medwey,
 and besieged the same, so that had not King 
Elfred

speedily come to the rescue, it had beene ouerthrowne by those 
Pagans.
 And againe in 
Anno
 999.
the 
Danes
 miserably spoiled this Citie in the time of King 
Ethelred:
 neither hath it stood safe from
danger since (though not defaced so much by warre) for twice hath it beene sore endammaged by
chance of fire: the first was in the raigne of King 
Henry
 the first, 
Anno
 1130. himselfe being present
with most of his Nobilitie, for the consecration of the Cathedrall Church of S. 
Andrew
 And a∣gaine
almost wholly consumed about the latter end of the Raigne of King 
Henry
 the second, 
Anno
1177.
 Yet after all these calamities it recouered some strength againe, by the bountie of King 
Hen∣ry

the third, both in buildings, and in ditching her about for defence.


(10) Ciuill broyles and diffentions hath this Countie beene burdened with, and that not one∣ly
vnder the 
Saxons
 and 
Danes,
 whose desolations were many and grieuous, but also by other rebel∣lions
since the 
Normans
 Conquest, both in those infamous insurrections, called 
The Barons Warres,

in the raigne of King 
Henry
 the Third, wherein much harme was done: as also vnder King 
Richard

the second, when 
Wat Tiler,
 Captaine of a dreadfull commotion, assembled at 
Black-heath, Mile end,

and in 
London,
 doing many outrages, where in 
Smithfield
 he was lastly strucke downe by 
William Wal∣worth

then Maior of the Citie, and worthily slaine for his notorious treasons. Againe, vpon 
Black-heath,
Michael Ioseph,
 the Lord 
Dawbeny,
 with their Cornish Rebels, were ouerthrowne by King

Henry
 the seauenth, 
Anno
 1497.



(11) 
Kent
 in the time of 
Iulius Caesar
 was gouerned by foure seuerall Kings. Vnder 
V
rtigern
 the

Britaine,
 by a Lieutenant called 
Gu
ong,
 from whom the said King gaue it to 
Hengist
 the 
Saxon,
 in fa∣uour
of his Daughter 
Rowen,
 who seeking to make himselfe absolute King thereof, e
ght yeares af∣ter
his first entrance, fought a victorious battle against the 
Britaines
 neere vnto 
Crayford,
 and thence∣forth
accounted that Prouince his owne. Yet afterward 
Vortimer
 the valiant 
Britaine,
 gaue him
battle at 
Aylesford
 in the which bo
h 
Horsa
 and 
Ca
gern,
 brethren to both the Generals, were sla
ne,
and the 
Saxons
 driuen into the Isle of 
Thanet,
 their first assigned habitation, not daring to enter the
Continent so long as 
Vortimer
 liued 
Cot
ger
 was inter
ed vpon that plaine, where to this day re∣maineth
his Monument, being foure stones pitched in manner of the 
S
henge,
 and is vulgarly
called 
Citscotchouse
 The like Monument was of 
Horfa
 at 
Ho
sted,
 which stormes and time haue now
deuoured. 
Hengist
 made this Prouince a Kingdome for himselfe and successors, which name and
power it retained the space of three hundred and twentie yeares, when 
Egbert
 King of the 
West Sax∣ons

subdued and ioyned it to his owne: in which subiection it stood vntill the time of the 
Normans.

Then it was giuen vnder the title of an Earledome by the Conquerour, vnto 
Ot
 bishop of 
Baye
x

his halfe-brother, whose succesors in that diginite were those most honourable Families, whose
Armes and Names within this plot are blazed and expressed. It is diuided principally into fiue
Lathes, subdiuided into 66. Hundreds, and them againe into 398. Parishes▪ and wherein had beene
seated twentie-three Religious Houses.













SVSSEX.
CHAPTER IIII.


SVTH-SEX, a word compounded of the sire th
reof Southward; lyeth stretched along the

British Seas.
 The North confronts vpon 
Sur
y
 and 
Kent,
 and the West butteth vpon 
Ha
ap∣shire.


(2) For forme it lyeth long and narrow, so that all her R
pes doe runne quite through the
Shire, & containeth from 
We
harting
 in the West, to 
Kent
-ditch that diuides it from 
Kent
 in the
East, sixtie foure miles, but in the broadest part little aboue twentie, the whole in circumference a∣bout
one hundred fiftie eight miles.


(3) The ayre is good, though somewhat clouded with wists, which arise forth of her South bor∣dering
Sea, who is very prodigall vnto her for Fish and Sea-sowle, though as sparing for Harbours
or Ships ariuage, and those which she hath, as vncertaine for continuance, as dangerous for en∣trance.


(4) Rich is the Soile and yeeldeth greatplentie of all things necessary, but very ill for trauellers,
especially in the winter, the Land lying low and the wayes very deepe, whose middle tract is garni∣shed
with meadowes, pastures, and Corn-fields: the Sea-coast with Hilles which are called the

Downs,
 abundantly yeelding both 
Graint
 and 
Grasse,
 and the North side ouershadowed with plea∣sant
Groues and thicke Woods, where sometimes stood the famous wood 
Andradswald,
 containing
no lesse then an hundred and twentie miles in length, and thirtie in bredth, taking the name of 
An∣derida

a Citie adioyning: both which were wonne from the 
Britaines
 by 
Llla
 the first 
Saxon
 King of
this Prouince, and the place made fatall to 
Sigebert
 King of the 
West-Saxons,
 who being deposed


from his Royall Throne, was met in this Wood by a Swine-heard, and slaine in reuenge of his Lord,
whom 
Sigebert
 had murdered.


(5) The ancient people in the 
Romans
 time were the 
Regni,
 of whom we haue spoken, and who
were subdued by 
Vespasian
 the Leader of the second Legion vnder 
A
lus Plautius,
 Liceutenant in

Britaine
 for 
Claudius
 the Emperour. But after the departure of the 
Romanes,
 this, with 
Surrey
 was
made the 
South-Saxons
 Kingdome: yet that giuing place to the 
West-Saxons,
 as they in time to the

Normans,
 it became a 
Prouince
 vnder the Conquerours power, who gaue to his followers much Land
in these parts▪


(6) The place of most account in this Shire is 
Chichester,
 by the 
Britaines
 called 
Caercei,
 a Citie
beautifull and large, and very well walled about, first built by 
Cissa
 the second King of the 
South-Saxons,

wherein his Royall palace was kept. And when King 
William
 the First had enacted that

Bishops Seas
 should be translated out of small Townes vnto places of greater resort, the Residence
of the Bishop (vntill then held at 
Selsey)
 was remoued to this Citie, where Bishop 
Raulfe
 began a
most goodly Cathedrall Church: but before it was fully finished, by a sudden mischance of fire
was quite consumed. Yet the same Bishop, with the helping liberalitie of King 
Henry
 the First, be∣gan
it againe, and saw it wholly finished; whose beautie and greatnesse her fatall enemy still en∣uying,
againe cast downe in the dayes of King 
Richard
 the First, and by her raging flames consu∣med
the buildings both of it and the Bishops Palace adioyning, which 
Seffrid
 the second Bishop
of that name reedified and built a new. And now to augment the honour of this place, the Citie
hath borne the Title of an 
Earledome;
 whereof they of 
Arundell
 were sometimes so stiled. Whose
Gradustion for Latitude, is remoued from the Equator vnto the degree fiftie, fiftie fiue minutes;
and for Longitude, obseruing the same point in the West, whence 
Mercator
 hath measured, are
twentie degrees.



(7) With whom for frequencie, bignesse, and building, the Towne 
Lewes
 seemeth to contend,
where King 
Athelstan
 appointed the mintage of his Moneyes, and 
William de Warron
 built a strong
Castle, whereunto the disloyall 
Barons
 of King 
Henry
 the Third in warlike manner resorted, and
fought a great Battle against their owne Soueraigne and his sonne, wherein the King had his Horse
slaine vnder him, 
Richard,
 King of the 
Romans
 surprised and taken in a Wind-mill, and Prince 
Ed∣ward

deliuered vnto them vpon vnequall conditions of peace. But a greater Battle was fought at

Battle,
 when the hazard of 
England
 was tryed in one dayes fight, and 
Harold
 the King gaue place to
his 
Conquerour
 by losing of his life, among sixtie seuen thousand nine hundred seuentie-foure Eng∣lish
men besides; whose bloud so spilt, gaue name to the place, in 
French, Sangue lac.
 And the soile
naturally after raine becomming of a reddish colour, caused 
William
 of 
Newbery
 vntruely to write,

That if there fell any small sweet showers in the place where so great a slaughter of the English-men was
made, presently sweateth forth very fresh bloud out of the earth, as if the euidence thereof did plainly de∣clare
the va
ce of bloud there shed, and cryed still from the earth vnto the Lord.


(8) But places of other note in this Shire are these: from 
Basham,
 Earle 
Harold
 taking the Sea
for his delight, in a small Boat, was driuen vpon the Coast of 
Normandie,
 where by Duke 
William
 he
was retained, till he had sworne to make him King after 
Edward Confessors
 death; which oath being
broken, the 
Bastard
 arriued at 
Pensey,
 and with his sword reuenged that 
Periurie
 at 
West-Wittering

also 
Ella
 the 
Saxon
 before him had landed for the conquering of those parts and gaue name to the
shore from 
Cimen
 his son. But with greater glory doth 
Gromebridge
 raise vp her head, where 
Charles

Duke of 
Orleaunce,
 father to 
Lewes
 the twelfth, King of 
France,
 taken prisoner at 
Agincourt,
 was
there a long time detained.


(9) The commodities of this Prouince are many and diuers, both in 
Corne, Cattle, Woods, Iron,

and 
Glasse;
 which two last, as they bring great gaine to their possessors, so doe they impouerish


the Countie of Woods, whose want will be found in ages to come, if not at this present in some
sort felt.


(10) Great haue beene the deuotions of religious Persons in building and consecrating many
houses vnto the vse and onely seruice of Christ; whose Beadmen abusing the intents of their Foun∣ders,
hath caused those Foundations to lament their owne ruines: for in the tempestuous time of
King 
Henry
 the Eight, eighteene of them in this Countie were blowne downe, whose fruit iell into
the 
appes of some that neuer meant to restore them againe to the like vse.


This Countie is principally diuided into sixe Rapes, euery of them containing a Riuer, a Castle,
and Forrest in themselues, besides the seuerall Hundreds whereunto they are parted, that is, the Rape
of 
Chichester
 into seuen, of 
Arundell
 into fiue, of 
Bramber
 into ten, of 
Lewes
 into thirteene, of 
Peuen∣sey

into seuenteene, and of 
Hastings
 into thirteene, in all fiftie sixe; wherein are seated ten Castles,
eighteene Market-Townes, and three hundred and twelue Parish-Churches.













SVRREY.
CHAPTER V.


SVRREY, by 
Beda
 called 
Suthri,
 lieth separated vpon the North from the Counties of 
∣kingham

and 
Mia
lesex,
 by the great Riuer 
Tha
s
s;
 vpon the East 
Kent
 doth inbound it;
vpon the South is held in with 
Sussex
 and 
Hampshire:
 and her West part is bordered vpon by

Hamp-shire
 and 
Bark-shire.


(2) The forme thereof is somewhat square, and lieth by Northand by East, whereof 
Redrith

and 
Frensham
 are the opposites, betwixt whom are extended thirtie-foure miles. The broadest part
is from 
Awfold
 Southward, to 
Thamisis
 by 
Stanes,
 and them asunder twentie two: the whole in cir∣cumference
is one hundred and twelue miles.


(3) The Heauens breathing ayre in this Shire is most sweet and delectable, so that for the same
cause many royall Palaces of our Princes are therein seated, and the Countrey better stored with
game then with graine, insomuch that this Countie is by some men compared vnto a home-spunne
freeze cloth, with a costly faire lift, for that the out-verge doth exceed the middle itselfe. And yet is
it wealthy enough both in Corne and Pasturage, especially in 
H
esdale,
 and towards the Riuer of

Thamisis.


(4) In this Shire the 
Regni
 (an ancient people mentioned by 
Ptolemie)
 were seated, whom he
brancheth further thorow 
Sussex
 and some part of 
Hamp-shire
 And in the wane of the 
Romans
 go∣uernment,
when the Land was left to the will of Inuaders, the 
South-Saxons
 vnder 
Ella
 here erected
their Kingdome, which with the first was raised, and soonest found end. From them no doubt the
Courtie was named 
Suth-rey,
 as seated vpon the South of the Riuer; and now by contraction is
called 
Surrey.



(5) And albeit the Countie is barren of Cities or Townes of great estate, yet is she stored with
many Princely Houses, yea and fiue of his Majesties, so magnificently built, that of some she may
well say, no Shire hath none such, as is 
None-such
 indeed. And were not 
Richmond
 a fatall place of

Englands
 best Princes, it might in esteeme be ranked with the richest: for therein died the great
Conquerour of 
France,
 King 
Edward
 the Third, the beautifull 
Anne
 daughter to 
Charles
 the Fourth,
Emperour, and intirely beloued wife to King 
Richard
 the Second; the most wise Prince King 
Henry

the Seuenth, and the rarest of her Sexe, the Mirrour of Princes, Queene 
Elizabeth,
 the worlds loue,
and Subiects joy.


(6) At 
Merton
 likewise 
Kenulph
 King of the 
West-Saxons
 came to his vntimely end: and at 
Lam∣beth

the hardre 
Canute,
 and last of the 
Danish Kings,
 died among his Cuppes But as these places were
fatall for the last breath of these Princes, so other in this Countie haue beene graced with the body
and beginning of other worthy Monarkes: for in 
Cherts
y Abbey
 King 
Henry
 the Sixth, who was de∣posed
and made away in the Tower of 
London,
 was first interred without all funerall pompe, but for
his holy life was imputed a Saint, and lastly translated, and intombed at 
Windsore.
 At 
Kingston
 like∣wise
stood the Chaire of Maiestic, wherein 
Athelstan, Edwin,
 and 
Ethelred
 sate at their Coronation,
and first receiued their Seepter of 
Imperiall Power Guildfor
 likewise hath beene farre greater then
now it is, when the Place of our 
English-Saxon King
 was therein set. And seeing it is the midst of
the Shire, the Graduation from hence shall be obserued, where for Latitude the Pole is raised from
the degree 51. 22. scruples: and her Longitude from the West in the degree 20. and 2. scru∣ples.


(7) Neither can we account 
Okam
 and 
Ripley,
 two small Villages, the least in this Shire, which
haue brought forth the well knowne men, 
William de Okam,
 that deepe Philosopher, and admirable
Scholar, and 
George de Ripley,
 the rung leader of our Alchymists and mysticall impostors; both of


them borne in this Countie, and very neere together. But why speake I of these, sith a place neerer
to sight, and greater for fame, euen 
Lambeth,
 is the High Seat of Ecclesiasticall Gouernment, Pie∣tie,
and Learning, and Palace of 
Canterburies Arch-bishops,
 the 
Metropolitan
 of 
England.
 First erec∣ted
by Archbishop 
Daldwin,
 and euer since hath beene the residing of all those worthy Prelates of
our Church, who in a long succession (euen from 
Anno 596)
 haue continued to him that now
most worthily sits at the Churches sterne, 
Richard
 by Gods prouidence Lord Archbishop of that
See, a most faithfull and prudent 
Counsellor
 vnto King IAMES, and a most learned and prouident
Guide of our most flourishing Church: whose gracious fauour vndeseruedly conferred vpon me,
hath beene a great encouragement to these my poore endeuours.


(8) Memorable places for Battles sought before the Conquest, were 
Wembledon,
 where (when
the fulnesse of prosperitie burst forth into 
Ciuill Dissensions
 among the 
Saxons)
 a bloudy Battle was
fought betwixt 
Cheau
in
 the 
West-Saxon
 and young 
Ethelbert
 of 
Kent,
 wherein he was discomfited,
and two of his principall Leaders slaine, about the yeare of Christ 560. and three hundred thirtie
three yeares after, King 
Elfred
 with a small power ouercame the 
Danes
 with a great slaughter at

Faruham
 in this Countie, which somewhat quelled the courage of his sauage enemy.


(9) Religious Houses erected in this Shire by the deuotion of Princes, and set apart ffom pub∣like
vses to Gods Diuine Seruice, and their owne Saluation, as then was taught, the best in account
were 
Sbene, Chertsey, Merton, Newarke, Rygate, Wauerley, Horsleg;
 and in 
Southwarke, Bermundsey,

and S. 
Maries.
 These all flourished with increase, till the ripe
esse of their fruit was so pleasing in
sight and taste vnto King HENRY the Eight, that in beating the boughes he brake downe
body and all, ruinating those houses, and seazing their rich possessions into his owne hands.
So jealous is GOD of his honour; and so great vengeance followeth the sinne of Idola∣trie.



(10) In this Shire haue stood eight faire and strong Castles: such were 
, 
Darking,
Starburg, Rygate, Guilford, Fara
am, Goseford,
 and 
Brenchingley:
 but of greater State are 
Oking,
O
lands, Non-such,
 and 
Richmond,
 his Majesties royall Mannors. And for seruice to the Crowne or
Common-wealths imployments, this Counties diuision is into thirteene Hundreds, wherein are
seated eight Market-Townes, and one hundred and fortie Parish-Churches.













HANT-SHIRE.
CHAPTER VI.


HANT-SHIRE, lying vpon the West of 
England,
 Is bordered vpon the North by 
Bark∣shire,

vpon the East with 
Surrey
 and 
Sussex,
 vpon the South with the 
British Seas,
 and 
Ile of
Wight,
 and vpon the West with 
Dorset
 and 
Wilt-shires.


(2) The length thereof from 
Blackwater
 in the North vpon 
Surrey,
 vnto 
Bascomb
 in the
South vpon the Sea, extended in a right line, is fiftie foure English miles: and the breadth
drawne from 
Peters-field
 in the East, vnto 
Tidworth
 in the West, and confines of 
Wilt-shire,
 is little
lesse then thirtie miles, the whole Circumference about one hundred fiftie and fiue miles.


(3) The Aire is temperate, though somewhat thicke by reason of the Seas, and the many Ri∣uers
that thorow the Shire doe fall, whose plentie of fish and fruitfull increase, doe manifoldly re∣deeme
the harmes which they make.


(4) The Soile is rich for Corne and Cattle, pleasant for pasturage, and plenteous for woods;
in a word, in all commodities either for Sea or Land, blessed and happy.


(5) Hauens it hath, and those commodious both to let in, and to loose out Ships of great bur∣then
in trade of Merchandise, or other imployments: whereof 
Portsmouth, Tichfield, Hamble,
 and

South-hampton
 are chiefe: besides many other creeks that open their bosomes into those Seas, and
the Coast strengthned with many strong Castles, such as 
Hurst, Calshot, South-hampton, S. Andrewes,
Worth, Porchester,
 and the South Castle, besides other Bulwarkes, or Blockhouses that secure the
Country: and further in the Land, as 
Malwood, Winchester,
 and 
Odiam,
 so strong, that in the time of
King 
Iohn,
 thirteene 
English-men
 onely defended the Fort for fifteene dayes against 
Lewis
 of 
France,

that with a great Host assaulted it most hotly.



(6) Anciently it was possest vpon the North by the 
Segontians,
 who yeelded themselues to 
Iulius
Caesar,
 and whose chiefe Citie was 
Vindonum, Caer Segonte,
 now 
Silcester;
 and vpon the South by the

Belga,
 and 
Regni,
 who were subdued by 
Plausius
 and 
Vespasian
 the 
Romans,
 where 
Titus
 rescuing his
Father, straitly besieged by the 
Britaines,
 as 
Dio
 and 
Forcatulus
 doe report, was grasped about with
an Adder, but no hurt to his person, and therefore taken for a signe of good lucke. Their chiefe
Towne was 
Rincewood,
 as yet sounding the name: and more within Land inhabited the 
Manures,
 as

Beda
 cals them, whose Hundreds also to this day giue a relish of their names.


(7) Neere 
Ringwood,
 and the place once Y
EN
, from God and peoples seruice, to Beast and
luxury, thirtie-sixe Parish-Churches were conuerted and pulled downe by the 
Conquerour,
 and thir∣tie
miles of circuit inforrested for his game of Hunting, wherein his sonnes 
Richard
 and 
Rufus,
 with

Henry
 the second sonne to Duke 
Robert,
 his first, felt by hasty death the hand of Iustice & Reuenge:
for in the same Forrest, 
Richard
 by blasting of a pestilent ayre, 
Rufus
 by shot taken for a beast, and

Henry
 as 
Absalom
 hanged by a bough, came to their vntimely ends At so deare a rate the pleasures
of dogs, and harbour for beasts were bought in the bloud of these Princes.


(8) The generall commodities gotten in this Shire, are Woolls, Clothes, and Iron, whereof
great store is therein wrought from the Mines, and thence transported into all parts of this Realme,
and their Clothes and Karsies carried into many forraine Countries, to that Countries great bene∣fit,
and 
Englands
 great prayse.


(9) The Trade thereof, with other prouisions for the whole, are vented thorow eighteene Mar∣ket-Townes
in this Shire, whereof 
Winchester,
 the 
Britaines Caer Gwent,
 the 
Romans Venta Belgarum,

is chiefe, ancient enough by our 
British Historians,
 as built by King 
Rudhudibras,
 nine hundred yeares
before the Natiuitie of Christ: and famous in the 
Romans
 times for the weauings and embroderies
therein wrought, to the peculiar vses of their 
Emperours
 owne persons. In the 
Saxons
 time, after two


Calamities of consuming fire, her walles was raised, and the Citie made the Royall Seate of their

West-Saxons
 Kings, and the Metropolitan of their Bishops See, wherein 
Egbert
 and 
 their
most famous Monarchs were Crowned: and 
Henry
 the third, the 
Normans
 longest 
, first
tooke breath: And here King 
Aethelstane
 erected six houses for his Mint
 but the 
Danish
 desolution
ouer-running all, this Citie felt their fury in the dayes of King 
Ethelbright,
 and in the 
Normans
 time,
twice was defaced by the mis-fortune of fire, which they againe repaired and graced with the trust
of keeping the publike Records of the Realme. In the ciuill warres of 
Maud
 and 
Stephen,
 this Citie
was sore sacked, but againe receiuing breath, was by King 
Edward
 the third appointed the place for
Mart of Wooll and Cloth. The Cathedrall Church built by 
Kenwolf
 King of the 
West-Saxons,
 that
had beene 
Amphibalus, S. Peters, Swithins,
 and now holy 
Trinitie,
 is the Sanctuarie for the ashes of
many 
English
 Kings: for herein great 
Egbert, Anno
 836. with his sonne King 
Ethelwolfe,
 857. Here

Elfred, Oxfords
 founder, 901 with his Queene 
Elswith,
 904. Here the first 
Edmund
 before the Con∣quest,
924. with his sonnes 
Elfred
 and 
Elsward:
 Here 
Edred,
 955. and 
Edwy,
 956 both Kings of

England:
 Here 
Emme,
 1052. with her 
Danish
 Lord 
Canute,
 1035. and his sonne 
Hardicanute,
 1042.
And here lastly the 
Normans, Richard
 and 
Rufus,
 1100. were interred; their bones by Bishop 
Fox

were gathered and shrined in little guilt coffers fixed vpon a wall in the Quire, where still they re∣maine
carefully preserued.


This Cities situation is fruitfull and pleasant, in a vally vnder hils, hauing her River on the East,
and Castle on the West, the circuit of whose walls are well neere two 
English
 miles, containing one
thousand eight hundred and eightie paces; thorow which openeth sixe gates for entrance, and there∣in
are seauen Churches for diuine Seruice, besides the Minister, and those decayed; such as 
Callen∣der,

uell Chappell, S. Maries Abbey,
 and the 
Friers,
 without in the Suburbes, and 
Soo
;
 in the East
is S. 
Peters,
 and in the North 
Hyde Church
 and 
Monasterie,
 whose ruines remaining, shew the beau∣tie


that formerly it bare. The Graduation of this Citie by the Mathematickes, is placed for Lati∣tude
in the degree 51. 10. minutes, and for Longitude 19. 3. minutes.


(10) More South, is 
South-hampton,
 a Towne populous, rich and beautifull, from whom the
whole Shire deriueth her name, most strongly walled about with square stone, containing in circuit,
one thousand and two hundred paces, hauing seauen Gates for entrance, and twentie-nine Towres
for defence, two very stately Keyes for Ships arriuage, and fiue faire Churches for Gods diuine ser∣uice,
besides an 
Hospitall,
 called 
G
ds house,
 wherein the vnfortunate 
Richard,
 Earle of 
Cambridge,

beheaded for treason, lieth interred. On the West of this Towne is mounted a most beautifull Ca∣stle,
in forme Circular, and wall within wall, the foundation vpon a hill so topped, that it cannot
be ascended but by staires, carrying a goodly prospect both by Land and Sea, and in the East with∣out
the walles a goodly Church sometimes stood, called S 
Maries,
 which was pulled downe, for
that it gaue the 
French
 direction of course, who with fire had greatly endangered the Towne: in
stead thereof, is newly erected a small and vnfinished Chappell. In this place, saith learned 
Camb∣den,

stood the ancient 
Clausentium,
 or fort of the 
Romans,
 whose circuit on that side extended it selfe
to the Sea: this suffered many depredations by the 
Saxon
 Pirates, and in 
Anno
 980. was by the

Danes
 almost quite ouerthrowne. In King 
Edward
 the thirds time, it was fired by the 
French,
 vn∣der
the Conduct of the King of 
Sicils
 sonne, whom a Country man encountred and strucke downe
with his Club, 
He crying Rancon, that is, Ransome: but he neither vnderstanding his language, nor the
Law that Armes doth allow, laid on more soundly, saying: I know thee a Frankon, and therefore shalt thou
dit:
 and in 
Richard
 the seconds time it was somewhat remoued, and built in the place where now it
standeth In this 
Clausentium, Canute
 to euict his flatterers, made triall of his Deitie, commanding
the Seas to keepe backe from his seat: but being not obeyed, he acknowledged God to be the one∣ly
supreame Gouernour, and in a religious deuotion gaue vp his Crowne to the Rood at 
Winchester.



More ancient was 
Silcester,
 built by 
Constantius,
 great 
Constantines
 sonne, whose Monument (they
say) was seene in that Citie, and where another 
Constantine
 put on the purple roabe against 
Hono∣
,

as both 
Ni
ius
 and 
Geruase
 of 
Canterbury
 doe witnesse. Herein by our 
Historians
 record, the
warlike 
Arthur
 was Crowned. Whose greatnesse for circuit contained no lesse then fourescore A∣cres
of ground, and the walles of great height, yet standing two miles in compasse about. This Ci∣tie
by the 
Danish
 Rouers suffred such wracke, that her mounted tops were neuer since seene, and
her Hulke (the wals) in mured to the middle in the earth, which the rubbish of her owne desolations
hath filled.


(11) Chiefe Religious houses within this Countie erected and againe suppressed were these,

Christs-Church, Beautieu, Whorwell, Rumsey, Redbridge, Winchester, Hyde, South-hampton,
 and 
Tich∣field.

The honour of this Shire is dignified with the high Titles of Marques, and them Earles of

Winchester
 and 
South-hampton;
 whose Armes of Families are as thou see
t, and her diuision into
thirtie seauen Hundreds, and those againe into two hundred fiftie three Parishes.













VVIGHT ILAND.
CHAPTER VII.


VVIGHT ILAND was in times past named by the 
Romans Vecta, Vectis,
 and 
Vecte∣sis,

by the 
Britaines, Guyth,
 and in these dayes vsually called by vs, 
The Ile of Wight.

It belongeth to the Countrie of 
South-hampton,
 and lyeth out in length ouer against
the midst of it South-ward. It is encompassed round with the 
British.
 Seas, and
seuered from the Maine land. that it may seeme to haue beene conjoyned to it,
and thereof it is thought the 
Brittish
 name 
(Guyth)
 hath beene giuen vnto it, which betokeneth
separation, euen as 
 being broken off and cut from 
Italy,
 got the name from 
Secando
 (which
signifieth cutting.)


(2) The forme of this Isle is long, and in the middest farre more wide then at eyther end: from

 Ile in the 
, to 
 Castle in the West it stretcheth out in length 20. miles, and in

 Northward, to 
 Southward 12. miles. The whole in circum∣ference

.


(3) The ay
e is commended both for health and delight, whereof the first is witnessed by the

 continuance of the Inhabitants in the state of then bodies before they be decayed, and the o∣ther
for quantitie giues place to no neighbouring Country.


(4) The ground (to say nothing of the Sea, which is exceeding full of fish) consisteth of soile
very fruitfull; yet the husbandmans labour deserues to be thankfully remembred, by whose paines
and industry it doth not onely supply it selfe, but affords 
orne to be carryed forth to others.
The 
and is plenteously stored with Cattle and Graine, and breeds euery where store of Conies,


Hares, Patridges and Phesants, pleasant for medow, pasturage, and Parkes; so that nothing is
wanting that may suffice man. The middest yeelds plentie of pasture; and forrage for Sheepe;
whose wooll the Clothiers esteeme the best; next vnto that of 
Leinster
 and 
Cotteswold:
 If you cast
your eyes towards the North, it is all ouer garnished with Meadowes, Pastures, and Woods: If to∣wards
the South side, it lyeth (in a manner) wholy bedecked with Cornefields enclosed, where at
each end the Sea doth so incroach
t selfe. that it maketh almost two Ilands besides, namely, 
Fresh∣water
Isle,
 which looketh to the West, and 
B
nbridge isle
 answering it to the East.


(5) The Commodities of the whole chiefly consist of Cattle, Sea fowle, Fish, and Corne,
whereof it hath sufficient: Woods are not here very plentifull; for that it is onely stored with one
little Forrest; yet the Country of 
Hamshire
 for vicinitie of Site, is a friendly neighbour in that be∣halfe;
so (as it were being tyed together in affinitie) they are alwayes readie, and propense to adde
to each others wants and defects by a mutuall supply.


(6) The ancient Inhabitants of this Iland were the 
Belga,
 spoken of in the seuerall Prouinces
of 
S
merset-shire, Wilt-shire,
 and 
Hamshire.
 Such as did then possesse it were called 
Lords of the Isle of
wight,
 till it fell into the Kings hands, by 
R
ger
 (Sonne to 
William Fits Osburne,
 slaine in the warre
of 
Flanders)
 that was driuen into exile. And 
Henry
 the first King of 
England
 gaue it vnto 
Richard
Riduers,
 with the see or Inheritance of the Towne of 
Christs-Church,
 where (at in all other places)
he built certaine Fortrestes.


(7) The principall Market-Towne in the Isle is 
Newport,
 called in times past 
Medena,
 and 
No∣vus
Burgus de Meden;
 that is, 
the new Burgh of Meden,
 whereof the whole Countrey is diuided into
East-
Meden,
 and West 
Meden.
 A Towne well seated, and much frequented; vnto whose Burgesles
his Majestie hath lately granted the choyse of a Major, who with his Brethren, doe gouerne accor∣dingly.
It is populous with Inhabitants, hauing an entrance into the Isle from the Hauen, and a


passage for Vessels of small burden vnto the Key. Not farre from it is the Castle 
Caresbrooke,
 whose
founder is said to haue beene 
Whitgar
 the 
Saxon,
 and from him called 
White-Garesburgh:
 but now
made shorter for easier pronunciation; the graduation whereof for Latitude is in the degree 50.
36. minutes: and her Longitude in 19. 4. minutes, where, formerly hath stood a Priory, and at

Quarre
 a Nunnery; a necessary neighbour to those Penitentiaries. And yet in their merry mood,
the Inhabitants of this Iland doe boast, that they were happier then their neighbour Countries,
for that they neuer had Monke that euer wore hood, Lawyers that cauilled, nor Foxes that were
craftie.


(8) It is reported, that in the yeare of mans saluation, 1176. and twentie-three of King 
Henry

the second, that in this Iland it rained a showre of bloud, which continued for the space of 2 houres
together to the great wonder and amazement of the people that beheld it with feare.


(9) This Isle of 
Wight
 is fortified both by Art and Nature: for besides the strength of Artifici∣all
Forts and Blocke-houses (wherewith it is well furnished) it wants not the assistance of naturall
Fences, as being enriched with a continuall ridge and range of craggy Cliffes and Rockes, and
Bankes very dangerous for Saylers, as the 
Needles,
 so called by reason of their sharpnesse: The

Shingles, Mixon, Brambles, &c.


(10) 
Vespasian
 was the first that brought it to the subiection of the 
Romaenes,
 whilest he serued
as a priuate person vnder 
Claudius Caesar.
 And 
Cerdic
 was the first 
English Saxon
 that subdued it, who
granting it vnto 
S
uffe
 and 
Whitgar,
 they joyntly together slew (almost) all the 
Brittish
 Inhabi∣tants
(being but few of them, there remaining) in the Towne aforesaid, called of his Name 
Whit∣garesburgh.
Wolpher
 King of the 
Merciam
 reduced this Iland afterwards vnder his obedience, and
at that time when he became God-father to 
Edelwalch
 King of the 
South-Saxons,
 and answered for
him at his Baptisme; he assigned it ouer vnto him, with the Prouince also of the 
Menuari.
 But when



Edelwalch
 was slaine, and 
Aruandus
 the petty King of the Iland was made away, 
Coedwalla
 King of
the 
West-Saxons
 annexed it to his Dominion, and in a tragicall and lamentable Massacre put to the
sword (almost) euery mothers childe of the in-borne Inhabitants.


The thing that is best worthy note and obseruation is this, That Bishop 
Wilfrid
 was the first that
instructed the Inhabitants of this Iland in Christian Religion, and brought them from Idolatrous
Superstition, with the which (vnto that time) they were obscurely blinded.


For Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, this Countrey belongeth to the Bishop of 
Winchester,
 and for Ci∣uill
gouernment to the Countie of 
South-hampton.
 It is fortified with the strength of sixe Castles,
traded with three Market-Townes, and hath 36. Parish-Churches planted in it.













DORCESTER-SHIRE.
CHAPTER VIII.


DORCESTER, from her ancient people DVROTRIGES, is most likely to haue receiued
that name: by the 
Britaines
 called DVVRGVVEIR, lyeth bounded vpon the North-side
with 
Somerset
 and 
W
lt-shire;
 vpon the West with 
D
shire,
 and some part with 
Somerset;

vpon the East altogether with 
Hampshire:
 and her South part is wholly bounded with the

British Seas.


(2) The forme growes wider from the West, and spreads her selfe the broadest in the midst,
where it extends to twentie-foure miles, but in length is no lesse then fortie-foure: the whole in
Circumference about, is one hundred and fiftie miles.


(3) The ayre is good, and of an healthfull constitution: the soyle is fat, affording many com∣modities,
and the Countrey most pleasant in her situation: for the In-land is watered with many
sweet and fresh running Springs, which taking passage thorow the plaine Vallies, doe lastly in a lo∣uing
manner vnite themselues together, and of their many branches make many bigge bodied
streames: neither doth the Sea deny them entrance, but helpeth rather to fill vp their Bankes,
whereby Vessels of burden discharge their rich Treasures, and her selfe with open hand distributeth
her gifts all along the South of this Shore.


(4) Anciently it was possest by the 
Durotriges,
 whom 
Ptolemie
 placeth along in this Tract, who
being subdued by the 
Romans,
 yeelded them roome, and vnwilling subiection. After them the 
Sax∣ons

set foot in these parts, whereof 
Portland
 seemeth from that 
Port
 to take name, who in this place
arriued in 
Anno
 703. and did sorely infest and annoy all the South Tract. And at 
Bindon
 before him



Kinegillus
 King of the 
West-Saxons,
 in the yeare of Christ 614. in a doubtfull and dangerous Battle
vanquished the 
Britaines
 Neither were the 
Saxons
 so surely herein seated, but that the 
Danes
 sought
to defeat them thereof: for twice these bold 
Rouers
 landed at 
Chartmouth,
 the first was in 
Anno
 831.
and raigne of King 
Egbert;
 and the other eight yeares after, when 
Ethelwulfe
 was King: in both
which they went away 
Victors.
 Yet when the 
Iron-side
 wore the 
English Diademe,
 and these fierce
people sought to plucke it from his 
Helmet,
 he met them at 
Pen ham
 in 
Gillingham Forrest,
 and with
a small power obtained a great victory, causing their King 
Canute
 with discourage to retire.


(5) Commodities arising in this Countie are chiefly 
Wools
 and 
Woods
 in her North, where the

Forrests
 are stored with the one, and the pleasant greene Hilles with the other. The inner part is o∣uer-spread
both with 
Corne
 and 
Grasse,
 and the Sea yeeldeth the 
Isidis Plocamos,
 a Shrub growing
not vnlike the 
Corrall
 without any leafe; besides her other gifts, turning all to great gaine: which
the more is made manifest by the many Market. Townes in this Shire, whereof 
Dorchester
 is the
chiefe, in 
Antonius
 his 
 termed 
Durnouaria,
 situated vpon the South side of 
Frome,
 and
the 
 called 
osse-way,
 wherein some of their 
L
gions
 kept, a, by the 
Rampiers
 and 
Coines

there daily digged vp is probably coniectured; at which time it seemeth the Citie was walled, where∣of
some part yet standeth, especially vpon the West and South sides, and the Tract and Trench most
apparent in a Quadrant-wise almost meeteth the Riuer, containing in circuit one thousand and se∣uen
hundred pases, but were cast downe by the 
Danes,
 whose tran
pling feete destroyed all things
wheresoeuer they came, and hands here razed the Trenches 
Mandbury
 and 
Poundbury,
 theseales of
their Siege, and signes of times miserie. About three hundred pases Southward from hence, stan∣deth
an old Fortification of Earth, trenched about, and mounted aboue the ordinary plaine, thirtie
pases, containing some fiue Acres of ground; wherein (at my there-being) plentie of 
Corne
 grew.
This the Inhabitants call 
The Maiden-Castle,
 hauing entrance thereunto onely vpon the East and


West This is thought to haue beene a Summer-Campe or Station of the 
Romans,
 when their 
Gar∣risons

kept the Frontiers of this Prouince.


The gouernment of this City is yearely committed to two 
Bailiffes,
 elected out of eight 
Magistrates

or 
Aldermen,
 a 
Recorder, Towr
-Clerke,
 and two 
Sergeants
 attending them: whence the North-pole
is eleuated 50. degrees 48. minutes in Latitude, and for Longitude is remooued from the first
West-point vnto the Meridian of 18. degrees.


(6) Other places also are memorable through the actions therein happening, or antiquities
there yet remaining: such is 
Badbury,
 now nothing but a 
Trench
 and decayed 
Castle,
 hardly seene,
though sometimes it was the 
Court
 of the 
West-Saxons Kings.
 Such also is 
Cerne,
 where 
Augustine
 the
English Apostle brake downe the 
Altars
 and 
Idols
 of the 
Saxons God
 HELL, whom they deuoutly
honoured as the onely conseruer of their health. 
Shaftesbury
 also, wherein one 
Aquila
 (whether
a 
Man
 or 
Eagle
 I know not) by our 
Historians
 report, is said to haue prophecied the future times of
this our Empire, and that after the raignes of the 
Saxons
 and 
Norman▪
 it should againe returne vnto
the gouernment of the 
British Kings.
 But with such vaine predictions our Nation is more then once
taxed by 
Philip
 the famous 
French
 Writer. In this Citie 
Edward
 the sonne of great 
Edgar,

and one and thirtieth Monarch of the 
English-men,
 was interred, being murdered at 
Corfe,
 a Castle
seated in the Ile of 
Purbeck,
 by his Step-mother 
Aelfrith,
 to make way for her sonne to enioy his
Crowne: in repentance whereof, and to pacifie Heauen for his bloud, she built the 
Monasteries
 of

Ambresbury
 and 
Whorwell,
 in the Countie of 
Wilt-shire
 and 
South-Hamton.
 In the former of which
with great penitency she spent the rest of her life.


(7) As vpon the like occasion the Monastery of 
Middleton
 was laied in this Shire by King 
E∣thelstan

to appease the 
Ghost
 of 
Edwine
 his innocent brother, and to expiate the sinne of his owne
soule for the bloud of that iust Prince, whom most vniustly he caused to die: and with the like de∣uotion,


though not to satisfie for the like blo
die sinnes▪ did Queene 
Cuthbarga
 sue a 
Diuorce
 from
her second husband the 
Northumberlands
 King, and it 
Winburne
 built her a 
Nunnery,
 whereof her
selfe bec
me 
Abbesse,
 where afterward was raised a most stately 
Minster,
 which added not onely more
glory to the place, but withall enlarged the name, and made it to be called 
Wimburn-minster,
 where
King 
Ethel
.
 a most vertuous Prince, after much disqu
nesse had with the 
Danes,
 in peace here
resteth, with his Tombe and Inscription, as in his History (Christ assisting) shall be further seene.
Neither among these may I omit 
Sherburne,
 which in the yeare of grace 704. was made a Bishops
See, in whose Cathedrall Church were interred the bodies of 
Ethelbald
 and 
Ethelbert,
 brethren, both
of them Monarkes of the 
English-men.


(8) Seuen more besides these were set apart from worldly imployments, consecrated onely to
God and his seruice in this Shire; which were 
Camestern, Cranborn, Ab
ottesbury, Bindon, Sturmister,
Tarrant,
 and 
Warham
 These with the others came to their full period vnder the hand of King

Henry
 the Eight, which lay with such waight vpon their fai
e buildings, that he crushed the iuyce
thereof into his owne Coffers.


(9) Castles for defence in repaire and decayed, were at 
Sherburne, Dorchester, Branksey, Portland,
Corfe, Newton, Woodford.
 and 
Wareham.
 So that with these and others the County hath beene strength∣ned
with twelue Religious Houses, their poore relieued, with eighteene Market-Townes at this day
is traded, and principally into fiue diuisions parted, subdiuided into thirtie-foure Hundreds, and
them againe into two hundred fortie-eight Parishes.













DEVON-SHIRE.
CHAPTER IX.


DEVON-SHIRE, by the 
Cornish Britaines
 called 
Deuinan;
 and by contraction of the vulgar

Denshire,
 is not deriued from the 
Danes,
 as some would haue it, but from the people 
Dan∣monij,

the same we will speake of in 
Cornwall,
 and whom 
Ptolemie
 hath seated in these Westerne
Borders.


(2) The West of this County is bounded altogether by the Riuer 
Tamar:
 the East is held
in with the verge of 
Somerset-shire:
 and the North and South sides are washed wholy with the 
Bri∣tish

and 
Severne Seas:
 Betwixt whose shoares from 
Cunshere
 in the North, vnto 
Salcombe Hauen
 en∣tering
in at the South, are fiftie fiue miles: and from the 
Hartland Point
 West, to 
Thorncombe
 East,
are fiftie foure: the whole Circumference about two hundred and two miles.


(3) The Ayre is sharpe, healthfull and good: the Soile is hilly, wooddy and fruitfull, yet so as
the hand of the Manurer must neuer be idle, nor the purse of the Farmer neuer fast shut, especially
of them that are farre from the Sea, whence they fetch a sand with charge and much trauell, which
being spread vpon the face of the earth, bettereth the leannesse thereof for graine, and giueth life to
the Glebe with great efficacy.


(4) As 
Cornwall,
 so this hath the same commodities that arise from the Seas: and being more in∣landed
hath more commodious Hauens for Sh
ppings entercourse, among whom 
Totnes
 is famous
for 
Brutes
 first entrance, if 
Geffry
 say true, or if 
Hau
llan
 the Poet tooke not a Poeticall libertie, when
speaking of 
Brute,
 he wrote thus:

The Gods did guide his sayle and course: the winds were at command:


And 
Totnes
 was the happie shoare where first he came on land.



But with more credit and lamentable euent, the 
Danes
 at 
Teigne-mouth
 first entred for the inuasion
of this Land, about the yeare of Christ 787. vnto whom 
Brightrik
 King of the 
West-Saxons
 sent the

Steward
 of his house to know their intents, whom resistantly they slew: yet were they forced backe
to their Ships by the Inhabitants, though long they stayed not, but eagerly pursued their begun en∣terprises▪


With more happie successe hath 
Plimouth
 set forth the purchasers of same, and stopped the en∣trance
of 
Englands
 Inuaders, as in the Raigne of that eternized Queene, the mirrour of Princes,

Elizabeth
 of euerlasting memory: for from this Port Sir 
Francis Drake,
 that potent man at Sea, set∣ting
forth 
Anno
 1577 in the space of two yeares and ten moneths did compasse the circle of the
earth by Sea. And the Lord 
Charles Howard, Englands
 high Admirall, did not onely from hence
impeach the entrance of the proud inuincible 
Spanish Nauy,
 intending inuasion and subuersion of
State, but with his Bullets so signed their passage; that their sides did well shew in whose hands they
had beene, as seales of their owne shame, and his high honour.


(5) The commodities of this Shire consist much in Wools and Clothings, where the best and
finest Kersies are made in the Land Corne is most plenteous in the fruitfull Vallies, and Cattle
spreading vpon the topped Hils; Sea Fish and Fowle exceedingly abundant. Veynes of Lead, yea
and some of Siluer in this Shire are found: and the Load-stone (not the least for vse and esteeme)
from the Rocks vpon 
Dart-more
 hath beene taken Many fresh Springs doe bubble from the Hils in
this Prouince, which with a longing desire of Socretie search out their passage, till they meete and
conjoyne in the Vallies, and gathering still strength with more branches, lastly grow bodyed able
to beare Ships into the Land, and to lodge them of great burthen in their Bosomes or Fals: where∣of

Tamar, Taue,
 and 
Ex
 are the fairest and most commodious▪


(6) Vpon which last the chiefe Citie and Shire-Towne of this Countie is seated, and from that


Riuer hath her name 
Excester:
 this Citie by 
Ptolemie
 is called 
Is
a;
 by the 


Emperour, Is
a Danmoniorum;
 and by the 
We so 
.
 It is pleasantly seated vpon the gentle 
scent
of an hill, 
so stately for building, so rich with 
 stran∣gers,
that a man can desire nothing but
 
. The walls of
this Citie first built by King 
 but towards the 
Ex
 ran∣geth
almost in a straight line hauing six Gates for entrance, and many 

betwixt, whose compasse containeth about fifteene hundred paces: vpon the East part of this Citie
standeth a Castle called 
Rugemont,
 sometimes the Palace of the 
West-Saxon
 Kings, and after them
of the Earles of 
Cornwall,
 whose prospect is pleasant vnto the 
 magni∣ficent
Cathedrall Church, founded by King 
Athelstan
 also, in the honour of S. 
Peter,
 and by 
Edward

the 
Confessor
 made the Bishops See, which the remoued from 
 in this Countie vnto
the Citie of 
Excester
 (as saith the priuate History of that place:) whose 
apidations the reuerend
Father in God 
William
 now Bishop of the 
Diocesse
 with great cost hath repaired; whom I may not
name without a most thankfull remembrance for the great benefits receiued by his carefull proui∣dence
toward me and mine. This Citie was so strong and so well stored of 
Britaines,
 that they held
out against the 
Saxons
 for 465. yeares after their first entrance, and was not absolutely 
 vntill

Athelstan
 became Monarch of the whole, who then peopled it with his 
Saxons,
 and 
 the
beautie thereof with many faire buildings: but in the times of the 
Danish
 desolations this Citie with
the rest, felt their destroying hands; for in the yeare 875. it was by them fore afflicted, spoyled, and
shaken, and that most grieuously by 
Swane
 in the yeare of Christ Iesus 1003. who razed it downe
from East to West, so that scarcely had it gotten breath before 
William
 the bastard of 
Normandy be∣sieged

it, against whom the Citizens with great manhood serued, till a part of the wall fell downe
of it selfe, and that by the hand of Gods prouidence, saith mine Author: since when it hath beene


three times besieged, and with valiant resistance euer defended. The first was by 
Hugh Courtney,

Earle of 
Deuenshire,
 in the Ciuill broyles betwixt 
Lancaster
 and 
Yorke:
 then by 
Perbin Warbeck,
 that
counterfeited 
Richard
 Duke of 
Yorke:
 and lastly, by the 
Cornish
 Rebels, wherein although the Citizens
were grieuously pinched with scarsitie, yet continued they their faithfull allegeance vnto King 
Ed∣ward

the sixt; and at this day flourisheth in tranquillitie and wealth, being gouerned by a Major,
twentie-foure Brethren, with a Recorder, Towne-Clerke, and other Officers their Attendants.
This Cities graduation is set in the degree of Latitude from the North-Pole 50. and 45. scruples:
and for Longitude from the West, to the degree 16. and 25. scruples. Neither is 
Ioseph
 that excel∣lent
Poet, whose birth was in this Citie, the least of her Ornaments, whose Writings bare so great
credit, that they were divulged in the 
Germane
 language vnder the name of 
Cornelius Nepos.


The like credit got 
Crediton
 in her birth-child 
Winefred
 the Apostle of the 
Hassians, Thuringers,
 and

Frisians
 of 
Germany,
 which were conuerted by him vnto the Gospell and knowledge of 
Christ.


(7) Places memorable in this Countie remaining for signes of Battles, or other antiquities are
these: vpon 
Exmore
 certaine Monuments of Anticke-worke are erected, which are stones pitched in
order, some triangle-wise, and some in round compasse: these no doubt were trophies of victories
there obtained, eyther by the 
Romans, Saxons,
 or 
Danes,
 and with 
Danish
 letters one of them is in∣scribed,
giuing direction to such as should trauell that way. 
Hublestowe
 likewise neere vnto the
mouth of 
Tawe,
 was the buriall place of 
Hubba
 the 
Dane,
 who with his Brother 
Hungar,
 had harried
the 
English
 in diuers parts of the Land: but lastly was there encountred with, and slaine by this
Shires Inhabitants, and vnder a heape of copped stones interred, and the Banner 
Reasen
 there and
then taken, that had so often beene spread in the 
Danes
 quarrell, and wherein they reposed no small
confidence for successe.



(8) A double dignitie remaineth in this Countie, where Princes of State haue borne the Ti∣tles
both of 
Deuonshire
 and 
Excester:
 of which Citie, there haue beene entituled Dukes, the last of
whom, namely, 
Henry Holland,
 Grand-childe to 
Iohn Holland,
 halfe-brother to King 
Richard
 the se∣cond;
siding with 
Lancaster
 against 
Edward
 the fourth, whose Sister was his wife, was driuen to such
misery, as 
Philip Comineus
 reporteth, that he was seene all torne and bare-footed to beg his liuing in
the 
Low Countries:
 and lastly, his body was cast vpon the shore of 
Kent
 (as if he had perished by
shipwracke) so vncertaine is 
Fortune
 in her endowments, and the state of man, notwithstanding his
great birth.


(9) Religious houses in this Shire built in deuotion, and for Idolatry pulled downe, were at

Excester, Torbay, Tanton, Tauestoke, Kirton, Ford, Hartland, Axmister,
 and 
Berstable.


(10) And the Counties diuisions are parted into thirtie-three Hundreds, wherein are seated
thirtie-seauen Market-Townes, and three hundred ninetie foure Parish-Churches.













CORNWALL.
CHAPTER X.


CORNWALL (as 
Matthew
 of 
Westminster
 affirmeth) is so named partly from the forme,
and partly from her people: for shooting it selfe into the Sea like a 
Horne
 (which the 
Bri∣taines

call 
Kerne)
 and inhabited by them whom the 
Saxons
 named 
Willia;
 of these two com∣pounded
words it became 
Cornwallia.
 Not to trouble the Reader with the Fable of 
Corineus,

cousin to King 
Brute,
 who in free gift receiued this Countie in reward of his prowesse, for
wrastling with the Grant 
Gogmagog,
 and breaking his necke from the 
Cliffe
 of 
Deuer,
 as 
e of 
Mon∣mouth

hath fabuled.


(2) Touching the temperature of this Countie, the ayre thereof is cleansed as with 
Bellowes,
 by
the 
Billowes
 that euer worke from o
t her enuironing Seas, where thorow it becommeth pure and
subtill, and is made thereby very healthfull, but withall so 
 and shar
e, that it is apter to pre∣serue
then to recouer health. The spring is not so early as in the more Easterne parts; yet the Sum∣mer
with a temperate heat recompenceth his slow fostering of the fruits, with their most kindly
ripening. The Autumne bringeth a somewhat late haruest: and the Winter, by reason of the Seas
warme breath, maketh the cold milder then else-where. Notwithstanding that Countrey is much
subiect to stormy blasts, who
e violence hath freedome from the open waues, to beat vpon the dwel∣lers
at Land, leauing many times their houses vncouered.


(3) The Soile for the most part is lifted vp into many hilles, parted a sunder with narrow and
short vallies, and a shallow earth doth couer their out-side, which by a 
Sea-weede
 called 
Orewood,
 and
a certaine kinde of fruitfull 
Sea-sand,
 they make so ranke and batten, as is vncredible. But more are


the riches that out of those hilles are gotten from the 
Mines
 of 
Copper
 and 
Tinne;
 which Countrey was
the first, and continueth the best stored in that Merchandize, of any in the world 
Timaeus
 the 
Histo∣rian

in 
Plinie
 reporteth, that 
the Britaines fetched their Tinne in wicker-boats, stitched about with Lea∣ther

And 
D
octo
us 
 of 
Augustus Caesars
 time writeth, that 
the Britaines in this part digged Tinne
out of 
 ground, which by Merchants was carried into Gallia, and thence to Narborne, as it were to a
Ma
:
 Which howsoeuer the 
Englis-Saxons
 neglected, yet the 
Normans
 made great benefit thereof,
especially 
Richard
 brother to King 
Henry
 the third, who was Earle of 
Cornwall,
 and by those 
Tinne-

became exceedingly rich: for the in
sions of the 
Mo
res
 hauing stopped vp the 
Tinne-Mines


, and them in 
Germany
 not discouered before the yeare of Christ 1240. these in 
Cornwall


 the want in all parts of the world. This Earle made certaine 
Tinne-Lawes,
 which with li∣berties
and priuiledges were confirmed by Earle 
Edmund
 his sonne. And in the dayes of King 
Ed∣

the third the Common-weale of 
Tinne-workes
 from one body was diuided into foure, and a

 of the 
Stan
rs
 appointed then Iudge.


(4) The Borders of this Shire on all parts but the East is bound in with the Sea: and had 
Tamer


 his course but foure miles further to the North, betwixt this 
Countie
 and 
Deuonshire,
 it might
haue beene rather accounted an 
Iland,
 then stood with the 
May
e
 Her length is from 
Launston
 to
the 
, containing by measure 60 miles: and the broadest part, stretching along by the 
Ta∣mer,

is fully fortie, l
s
ening thence still lesser like a horne.


(5) The ancient Inhabitants knowne to the 
Romans,
 were the 
Danmonij,
 that spread themselues

 into 
Deuonshire
 also, by the report of 
Diodorus Siculus, a most courteous and ciuill people:
 and by

Mechael
 their Poet extolled for 
 and strength of lim
es:
 nor therein doth he take the libertie
that Poets are allowed, to adde to the subiect whereof they write, but truly reporteth what we see
by them performed, whom actiuitie surmount many other people.



When the 
Heathen Saxons
 had seated themselues in the best of this Land, and forced the 
Christian
Britaines
 into these rockie parts, then did 
Cornwall
 abound in 
Saints,
 vnto whose honor most of the
Churches were erected, by whose names they are yet knowne and called. To speake nothing of

Vrsula
 that Counties Dukes daughter, with her company of canonized 
Virgin-Saints,
 that are now
reputed but to trouble the 
Calendar.
 These 
Britaines
 in 
Cornwall
 so fenced the Countrey, and defen∣ded
themselues, that to the raigne of King 
Athelstant
 they held out against the 
Saxons,
 who subdu∣ing
those 
Western Parts,
 made 
Tamar
 the Bounder betwixt them and his 
English,
 whose last 
Earle
 of
the 
British Bloud
 was called 
Candorus.


(6) But 
William
 the 
Bastard
 created 
Robert
 (his halfe-brother by 
Herlotta
 their mother) the first

Earle
 of the 
Normans
 race: and 
Edward
 the 
Blacke Prince,
 the ninth from him, was by his Father King

Edward
 the third inuested the first 
Duke
 of 
Cornwall,
 which Title euer since hath continued in the

Crowne.


(7) The commodities of this Shire, ministred both by 
Sea
 and 
Soile,
 are many and great; for
besides the abundance of 
Fish
 that doe suffice the Inhabitants, the 
Pilchard
 is taken, who in great
skuls swarme about the Coast, whence being transported to 
France, Spaine,
 and 
Italie.
 yeeld a yeare∣ly
reuenew of gaine vnto 
Cornwall:
 wherein also 
Copper
 and 
Tinne
 so plentifully grow in the vtmost
part of this 
Promontory,
 that at a low water the veynes thereof lie bare, and are seene: and what gaine
that commoditie begets, is vulgarly knowne. Neither are these 
Rockes
 destitute of 
Gold
 nor 
Siluer,

yea and 
Diamonds
 shaped and pointed Angle-wise, and smoothed by 
Nature
 her selfe, whereof some
are as bigge as 
Walnuts,
 inferiour to the 
Orient
 onely in blacknesse and hardnesse.


Many are the 
Ports, Bayes,
 and 
Hauens
 that open into this Shire, both safe for arriuage, and com∣modious
transport; whereof 
Falmouth
 is so copious, that an hundred Ships may therein ride at An∣chor
apart by themselues, so that from the tops of their highest Masts, they shall not see each other,
and lie most safely vnder the winds.



(8) This 
Countie
 is fruitfull in 
Corne, Cattle, Sea-fish,
 and 
Fowle:
 all which, with other prouisions
for pleasures and life, are traded thorow twentie-two 
Market-Townes
 in this Shire, whereof 
Launston

and 
Bodman
 are the best; from which last, being the middle of the Shire, the Pole is eleuated to the
degree of Latitude 50▪ 35. minutes, and for Longitude from the first West point, 15. 13. minutes,
as 
Mercator
 hath measured them.


(9) Memorable matters both for antiquitie and strangenesse of sight, are these: At 
Boske

vpon the South-west of her 
Promontorie,
 is a 
Trophy
 erected, which are eighteene Stones placed
round in compasse, and pitched twelue foot each from others, with another farre bigger in the very
center. These doe shew some Victory there attained, either by the 
Romans,
 or els King 
Athelstane.

At the foot of the 
Rockes
 neere vnto S. 
Michaels Mount,
 in the memory of our fathers, were digged
vp 
Speare-heads, Axes,
 and 
Swords
 of 
Brasse,
 wrapped in linnen, the weapons that the 
Cimbrians
 and
ancient 
Britaines
 anciently vsed.


At 
Camelford
 likewise peices of 
Armours
 both for horse and man, are many times found in digging
of the ground, imputed to be the signes of that fight wherein 
Mordred
 was slaine, and wherein great

Arthur
 receiued his deaths wound. And at 
Cas
le-Dennys
 are the Trenches wherein the 
Danes
 lod∣ged
when they first minded to subdue the Land, In the Parish S 
Clare,
 two stones are pitched, one
of them inscribed with a strange Character, and the other called 
the other halfe stone
 The 
Hurlers

also, fabuled to be men metamorphosed into stones; but in truth shew a note of some Victory, or
else are so set for Land-markes Bounders. There also the 
Wring-cheese
 doth shew it selfe, which are
huge Rockes heaped one vpon another, and the lowest of them the least, fashioned like a 
Cheese,
 ly∣ing
pressed vnder the rest of those Hils, which seemeth very dangerous to be passed vnder 
 neere
to 
Pensans,
 and vnto 
Mounts-bay,
 a fa
e more strange 
Rocke
 standeth, namely, 
Main Amber,
 which


lyeth mounted vpon others of meaner size, with so equall a counterpoize, that a man may moue it
with the push of his finger, but no strength remoue it out of his place.


(10) Religious houses built, and suppressed within the limits of 
Cornwall,
 the fairest and grea∣test
for account, were 
Launston, S. Neotes, S. Buriens, S. Michaels Mount,
 and 
S. Germans
 a Bishop

See: so was 
Bodman
 also, from whence King 
Edward
 the 
Confessor
 remoued it vnto the Citie of 
En∣cester.


(11) The diuision of this Shire is into nine Hundreds, wherein are seated twentie-two 
Market-Townes,

and 161. 
Parish-Churches.














SVMMERSET-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XI.


SVVMMERSET-SHIRE is both a rich and spacious Countrey, hauing the 
Seuerne Sea
 beating
vpon it on the North-side, the South part bordering vpon 
Deuon
 and 
Dorset shires,
 the West
confined with 
Deuon-shire,
 and the East and North-East vpon 
Wiltshire,
 and 
Gloucester-shire.

It tooke the name of 
Sommerton
 (sometime the chiefe Towne of this Shire) whence in the
ancient Historian 
Asserius,
 this Countie is called 
Sommertunensis,
 that is, 
Sommertun-shire.


(2) The forme thereof is large, bearing it selfe still wider as it stretcheth into the middle part
thereof, and containes in length from 
Brackley
 neere vnto 
Frome-Selwood
 Eastward, to 
Oure
 in the
West, Miles 55. In breadth from 
Porshut point
 in the North, to 
Chard
 Southward, is somewhat a∣boue
fortie miles. The whole circumference is about 204. miles.


(3) The ayre is milde and pleasing, and for the most part subiect to such temperate dispositions
as the Sommer-season affordeth, whence some haue erroniously conceited, that the Region borrow∣ed
her name from the nature of her Clime: yet how delightefull so euer it is in the time of Sommer,
with change of the season it may well change her pleasing name, and borrow some Winterly deno∣mination;
so full of wet, so myrie and moorish it is; in so much as the Inhabitants can hardly tra∣uell
to and fro without their great encumbrance.


(4) Howbeit they passe ouer this with all patience, knowing their ensuing seasonable profits
farre to exceede any present detriments and displeasures: for as it is foule, so it is fruitfull, which
makes them comfort themselues with this Prouerbe, that 
What is worst for the Rider, is best for the
Abider:
 the Soyle and Globe thereof being very fertile, and euery side garnished with Pastures and


delightfull Meadowes, and beautified with Mannor houses both many and fayre; and (in a word)
hath euery thing in it to content the purse, the heart, the eye, at home: and sufficient Ports to giue
entertainment to commodities from abroad.


(5) The ancient Inhabitants that possessed this Prouince were the 
Belgae,
 who spread themselues
farre and wide, as well here as in 
Wiltshire,
 and the inner parts of 
Hamshire:
 who being branched
from the 
Germans,
 conferred the names of those places from whence they came, vpon these their
seats where they resided.


(6) The generall profits of this Prouince are Corne and Cattle, wherewith it is so plentifully
stored, as it may challenge any neighbouring Country for the quantitie to make shew of Cattle so
fat, or Graine so rich. Some places are peculiarly enriched by Lead-mines, as 
Mindiphiis,
 (perchance
so called of the deepe Mynes) by 
Leiland
 aptly tearmed 
Minerarij, Minerall-hils,
 which yeeld plenty
of Lead, the most Merchantable Commoditie that is in 
England,
 and vented into all parts of the
world Some are beautified with Diamons, as S 
Vincent Rocke,
 whereof there is great plentie, and
so bright of colour, as they might equalize 
Indian
 Diamonds, if they had their hardnesse yet being
so many and so common, they are lesse sought after or commended


(7) This Country is famoused by three Cities, 
Bath, Wels,
 and 
Bristow
 The first takes name
of the hot Bathes, which 
Antonine
 called 
Aqua Solis, The waters of of the Sunne; Stephanus, Badiza;
 we
at this day 
Bathe,
 and the Latinists 
Bathonia:
 a place of continuall concourse for persons of all de∣grees,
and almost of all diseases, (whence it was sometimes called 
Ak
man cester)
 who by diuine pro∣uidence
doe very often finde reliefe there, the Springs thereof by reason of their Minerall and sul∣phurous
passage, being of such exceeding power and medicinable heat, as that they cure and con∣quer
the rebellious stubbornnesse of corrupt humors, in respect of which admirable vertues, some
haue fabled, that they were first conuayed by Magicke Art. To testifie the antiquitie of this place,


m
ny Images and Romane Inscriptions are found in the walles, which can now be hardly read,
they are so worne and eaten into by age. 
Wels
 (as 
Leiland
 reporteth) was sometimes called 
Theodo∣rodunum,

but from whence it had that denomination he makes no mention: The name it now bea∣reth
is taken (as some thinke) from the Riuer there, which King 
Kinewulph
 in his Charter 
An
 766.
calleth 
Welwe,
 or (as others) from the 
Wel
 or 
Springs
 which there breake forth, and whereupon that
See (vnder whose Iurisdiction is also the Citie of 
Bath)
 hath beene anciently called 
Pontanensis Ec∣clesi
,

the 
Fountaine-Church:
 where the 
Cathedrall
 built by King 
Inas
 to the memory of S. 
Andrew,

is very beautifull and richly endowed. The Citie is likewise well replenished both with Inhabitants
and seemly buildings. Whose gouernment is managed by a Major yearely elected, a Recorder, and
seuen Maisters, hauing the assistance of sixteene Burgesses, a Towne-Clerke, and two Sergeants at
Mace. Whose Latitude is 51. 20. minutes, and Longitude 17. 31. minutes. 
Bristow
 is not so anci∣ent,
as it is faire and well seated: The beautie of it being such, as for the bignesse thereof, it scarce
giues place to any Citie of 
England,
 and doth worthily deserue the 
Saxon
 name 
Bright-stad:
 whose
pleasantnesse is the more, by reason that the Riuer 
Auon
 scowres through the midst of it, which to∣gether
with the benefit of 
Sewes
 vnder all the streets, cleares the Citie of all noysome filth and vn∣cleannesse.
It is not wholly seated in this Countie of 
Sommerset,
 but one part thereof in 
Gloucester∣shire

but because it is an entire Countie of it selfe, it denyes subiection vnto eyther, hauing for its
owne gouernment both a Bishop, with a well furnished Colledge, and a Major, with a competent
assistance of Aldermen, and other Officers for Ciuill affaires.


(8) This Prouince hath beene the Theater of many Tragicall euents and bloudy Battels: the

Danes
 did grieuously afflict 
Porlock
 by cruell Piracies, in the yeare eight hundred eight
e sixe. Yet
neere vnto 
Pen
 a little village 
eighbouring vpon 
North Cadbury, Edmund,
 surnamed 
Iron-side,
 gaue
them a notable soyle, as he was pursuing 
Ca
tus
 from place to place, for vsurping the 
Crowne
 of



England.
 And 
Keniwalth
 (a 
West-Saxon)
 in the same place had such a day against the 
ritaines,
 that
they euer after stood in awe of the 
English-Saxons
 prowesse. 
Marianus
 relateth that not farre from

Bridge-water
 as the 
D
es
 were stragling abroad, 
Ealstan
 Bishop of 
Sherbourne
 did so foyle their
Forces in the yeare 845 as their minds were much discomfited, and their powers vtterly disabled.

Ni
ius
 also writeth, that King 
Arthur
 did so defeat the 
English-Saxons
 in a battell at 
Cadbury,
 that it
deserued to be made perpetuously memorable. Neither is 
Mo
s Badonicus
 (now 
Bannesdowne)
 lesse
famous for 
Arthurs
 victories. And King 
Elfred
 in another battell not farre from hence gaue the 
Danes

such an ouerthrow, as he forced them to submission, and induced 
Godrus
 their King to become a
Christian, himselfe being God-father to him at the 
ont. So happie is this 
Region,
 and so behol∣ding
to Nature and Art for her strengths and fortifications, as she hath alwayes beeene able to defend
her selfe, and offend her enemies.


(9) Neither hath it beene lesse honoured with beauteous houses consecrated to Religion: such
was that of 
Black-Charons
 at 
Barelinch
 in the first limit of this Shire Westward: and King 
Athelstan

built a Monastery in an Iland called 
Muchelney
 (that is to say) the 
great Iland,
 which is betweene
the Riuers 
Iuel
 and 
Pedred,
 running together, where the defaced walles and ruines thereof are yet to
be seene King 
Henry
 the third also erected a Nunnery at 
Witham,
 which was afterwards the first
house of the 
Carthusian
 Monkes in 
England,
 as 
Hin
n
 not far off was the second. But aboue all other
for antiquitie, glory, and beautie was the Abbey of 
Glaste
bury,
 whose beginning is fetcht euen from

Ioseph
 of 
A 
athea,
 which 
Deni
 Bishop of S. 
Dauids
 repaired, being fallen to ruine, and King 
Inas

lastly builded a fayre and stately Church in this Monastery, though it be now made euen with the
ground, the ruines onely shewing how great and magnificant a Seat it hath anciently beene; which
seuerall houses were thus beautified by bounteous Princes, for religious purposes, and to retire the
mind from worldly seruices, though blinded times and guides diuerted them to superstitious and
lewd abuses.



(10) Other memorable places are these, 
Camal
t
 a very steepe hill hard to be ascended which
appeares to haue beene a worke of the 
Romans
 by diuers Coynes digd vp there, on the top whereof
are seene the lineaments of a large and ancient Castle, which the Inhabitants report to haue beene
the Palace of King 
Arthur. Ilchester,
 which at the comming of the 
Normans
 was so populou
, that it
had in it an hundred and seuen Burges
es, and it appeares to be of great antiquitie by the Romane

Caesars
 Coynes, oftentimes sound there. The Church yard of 
Aualonia
 or 
Glastenbury,
 wh
re King

Arthurs
 Sepulcher was searcht for by the command of King 
Henry
 the second, which was found
vnder a stone, with an Inscription vpon it fastned, almost nine foote in the ground. Also 
Dunstere,

where (as is reported) a great Lady obtained of her husband so much Pasture ground in common
by the Towne side, for the good and benefit of the Inhabitants, as she was able in a whole day to
goe about bare-foote.


This Countie is diuided into 42. Hundreds for the disposing of businesse needfull to the State
thereof, wherein are placed 33. Market-Townes, fit for buying and selling, and other affayres of
Commerce. It is fortified with foure Castles, and planted with 385. Parishes, for concourse of di∣uine
seruice.













VVILT-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XII.


VVILT-SHIRE, is enclosed vpon the Northwith 
Glocester-shire,
 vpon the East is
bounded with 
Bark-shire,
 vpon the South with 
Dorset
 and 
Hampshire,
 and vpon the
West is confronted against partly by 
Glocester,
 and the rest by 
Somerset shires.


(2) The forme thereof 
s both long and broad; for from 
Inglesham
 vpon 
Tha∣misis

in the North, to 
Burgat Damarum
 in the South, are thirtie nine miles: the
broadest part is from 
Bu
termer
 Eastward, to the 
Shire-stones
 in the West, being twentie nine; the
whole in Circumference is one hundred thirtie nine miles.


(3) For Ayre, it is seated in a temperate Climate, both sweet, pleasant, and wholesome; and for
soile (saith 
Iohn
 of 
Sarisbury) is exceeding fertile and plentifull, yea, and that with va
ietie.


(4) The Northerne part which they call 
North Wilt shire,
 riseth vp into delectable hilles, attired
with large Woods, and watered with cleare Riuers, whereof 
Isis
 is one, which soone becommeth the
most famous in the Land. The South part is more euen, yeelding abundently grasse and corne;
and is made the more fruitfull by the Riuers 
Wily, Adder,
 and 
Au
n.
 The midst of this Countie is
most plaine, and thereby is knowne and commonly called 
Salesbury


, and lie so leuall indeed,
that it doth limit the 
Horizon:
 or hardly can a man see from the one side to the other. These 
Plaines

grase an infinite number of sheepe, whose fleeces and flesh bring in an yearely reuenew to their ow∣ners.


(5) Anciently this Countie was possessed by the 
Belga,
 who are seated by 
Ptolemie
 in 
Hampshire,
Somerset shire,
 and in this Tract; and they (as it seemeth by 
Casar)
 were of the 
Belga
 in 
Gaul
 These


(as some hold) were subdued by 
Vespasian,
 Lieutenant of the second Legion under 
Claudius,
 when
the foundations of his future greatnesse were in these parts first laid by his many Victories ouer the

Britaines.
 And herein surely the 
Romans
 seated; for besides 
Yan
sburie Trench,
 by Tradition held to
be his, in many other Forts in this Shire the Tract of their footing hath beene left, and the stam∣ped
Coines of their Emperours found, an apparent testimony of their abode.


(6) After them the 
West-Saxons
 made it a part of their Kingdome, whole border was 
Auon,
 as
witnesseth 
Athelward,
 though the 
Mercians
 many times encroched vpon them, whereby many great
Battles, as 
Malmesbury
 tels vs, betwixt them were fought, when in the young yeares of their 
Heptar∣chie

each sought to enlarge his, by the lessening of the next: but growne vnto more ripenesse, they
assigned their limits by a great and long ditch crossing thorow the middest of these 
Plaines,
 which
for the wonder thereof is supposed by the vulgar to be the worke of the 
Deuill,
 and is called of all,

Wansdike,
 vndoubtedly of 
Woden,
 the 
Saxons
 Ancestor and great reputed God, where a little village
yet standeth, and retaineth to name 
Wodens-burg
 At this place, in 
Anno 590. Ceaulin
 the 
West-Sax∣on,

receiued such a foyle of the 
Britaines
 and his Countrey-men, that he was forced to forsake his
Kingdome, and to end his dayes in exile, becomming a pittifull spectacle euen vnto his enemies.
And in this place 
Ina
 the 
West-Saxon
 joyned Battle with 
Ceolred
 the 
Mercian,
 whence both of them
departed with equall losse. The like was at 
Bradford
 by 
Ke
lwach
 and 
Cuthred;
 at 
Wilton,
 betwixt

Egbert
 and 
Beornwolfe;
 at 
Edindon,
 where King 
Elfred
 was vanquisher of the 
Danes;
 and at 
Wilton,

where the 
Danes
 wonne the day against him. With as bloudy successe, though not happening by
sword, was the issue of that Synod assembled at 
Colne,
 a small Towne in this Countie, in the yeare
of Christ Iesus 977 where being hotly debating for the single life, and against the marriages of the

Clergie,
 what wanted by the Word to proue their diuorce, was supplyed by a Stratagem, and that ve∣ry
bloudy; for suddenly the maine timber brake, and downe fell the floore with the Nobles and


Prelates, the Gentlemen and Commons, whereby a great number were hurt, and many more slaine;
onely 
Dunstan
 the President and mouth for the Monkes, escaped vntouched, the Ioist whereon his
Chaire stood remaining most firme: which confirmed the sentence of their separations, whom God
had conioyned, and became the fall and snare of much incontinencie in both sexes.


(7) The chiefest Citie of this Shire is 
Salesburie,
 remoued from a higher, but a farre more con∣uenient
place; whose want of water was not so great in the mother, as is supplied and replenished in
the daughter, euery street almost hauing a Riuer running thorow her middest; and for sumptuous
and delicate buildings, is inferiour to none. The Cathedrall, a most rich magnificent Church, was
begun by 
Richard Poore, Bishop,
 and with fortie yeares continuante was raised to her perfect beau∣tie:
wherein are as many windowes as there are dayes in the yeare, as many cast pillars of Marble,
as there are houres in the yeare, and as many gates for entrance as there are moneths in the yeare.
Neither doth this Citie retaine true honour to her selfe, but imparteth hers, and receiueth honour
from others, who are intituled 
Earles of Salesburie,
 whereof eight noble Families haue beene digni∣fied
since the 
Normans C
quest.
 This Cities situation is in the degree of Latitude 51. 10 minutes,
and from the first West point obserued by 
Mercator,
 18 Degrees, and 31. minutes of Longi∣tude.


(8) Ouer this, old 
Salesburie
 sheweth it selfe, where 
K
n
k
 ouercame the 
Britaines,
 and where

Canutus
 the 
Dane
 did great dammage by fire. This formerly had beene the Seat of the 
Romans:
 as
likewise was 
Lecham,
 as by their Coines digged vp is apparant: so were 
Brokenbridge
 and 
Cosham,

the Courts of the 
Saxon Kings
 But 
Fortune
 long since hath turned her face from all these, as lately
she did from many ancient and religious foundations planted in this Prouince, whereof 
Mal
esbu∣rie

was the most famous I will not with 
Monmouth
 auouch the foundation thereof vnto 
Mulmutius,



but by true Records from 
Maidulph
 a 
Scot,
 a man of great learning, that therein built a 
Cell,
 and lead
an 
Hermits
 life, whereof 
Beda
 calleth it the Citie of 
Maidulph,
 and we by contraction, 
Malmesburie,
Adelme
 his Disciple and Successor, built here a faire Monastery, which 
Athelstan
 the Monarch rich∣ly
endowed, and left his body after death there to rest. Neither hath any graced this more then 
Wil∣liam

her Monke, in recording to posterities the Chronicles of our Land, concerning both the
Church and Common-weale, wherein himselfe liued and wrote those Histories.


(9) 
Ambresburie
 for repute did second this, built by 
A
fritha,
 King 
Edgar
 his wife, to expiate the
sinne of murder which she committed vpon yong 
Edward
 her sonne in law, that hers might be King.
In this place Queene 
Eleanor,
 widow to King 
Henry
 the third, renounced all royall pompe, and de∣uoted
her selfe vnto God in the habit of a Nunne. Other places erected for pietie, were at 
Salesbu∣rie,
Lacock, Stanley, Wilton, Luichurch, Farnleg, Bradstole, Briopune,
 and 
Brombore.
 These grafts growne
to full greatnesse, were cut downe by the Pruiner, least the cankers thereof should infect the whole
body (as by them was alledged) and their Reuenewes bestowed vpon farre better vses, both for
the bringing vp of youth, and the maintenance of estate.


(10) With eight strong Castles this Countie hath beene guarded; in nineteene Market-Townes
her commodities are traded: into twentie-nine Hundreds for businesse is diuided, and in them are
seated three hundred and foure Parish-Churches.













BARK-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XIII.


BARK-SHIRE, whether of the 
Eo
-woods
 there sited, according to the censure of 
Asserius
Meneuensis,
 or from a naked and beare-lesse 
Oke-tree,
 whereunto the people vsually resorted in
troublesome times, to conferte for the State, I determine not: onely the Countie a long time
hath beene so called, and bounded with other in manner as followeth: The North-part is par∣ted
by 
Thamisis
 from 
Buckingham
 and 
Oxford-shires;
 the South neere 
Kennet
 doth tract vpon

Hampshire;
 the East is confined with the Countie of 
Surrey;
 and the West with 
Wiltshire
 and 
Gloce∣stershire

is held in.


(2) The forme of this Shire doth somewhat resemble a 
Sandall
 for a mans foot, lying long-wise
from East to West, in which part she is broadest, the middle most narrow, and then spreading wi∣der
like to the heele: though for her rich endowments and stately magnificence, it may be well ac∣counted
the heart of the whole.


(3) The length thereof from 
Inglesham
 in the West, to old 
Windsor
 in the East, extendeth vnto
fortie miles; from 
Inkpen
 to 
Wightham,
 the broadest part from South to North are twentie-foure;
the whole in Circumference, about one hundred and twentie miles.


(4) The Ayre is temperate, sweet, and delightfull, and prospect for pleasure inferiour to none;
the Soile is plenteous of corne, especially in the Vale of 
White-horse,
 that yeeldeth yearely an admira∣ble
encrease. In a word, for Corne and Cattle, Waters, and Woods, of profit and pleasure, it giues
place vnto none.


(5) Her ancient Inhabitants, by 
Ptolemie
 and 
Caesar,
 were the 
Attrebat
,
 and them of those that
descended from 
Gallia,
 among whom 
Comius
 (conquered by the Dictator) was of good respect,


and could doe much with the 
Britaines,
 who (as 
Frontinus
 reporteth) vsed this stratagem, though it
proued nothing at last: he flying before 
Caesar
 to recouer ayd of these 
Attrebatians,
 light bedded vp∣on
a shelfe in the Sea, whereupon hoysting his sailes as before a fore-winde, gaue shew to his pursu∣er
that they were in swift flight; so that hopelesse to hayle them, he gaue ouer the chase: yet no soo∣ner
had 
Caesar
 made ouer among them, but that some of these people, by name the 
Bibroces,
 yeelded
him subiection, which prued the ruine of all former libertie But when the 
Romans
 had rent their
owne Empire, and retired their Legion into a narrower circuit, the 
Sa
ns
 set foot where their for∣ces
had beene, and made this Countie a parcell of their Westerne Kingdome.


The 
Danes
 then setting their desire vpon spoiles, from their 
oauing Pinnaces pierced into these
parts, and at 
Redding
 fortified themselues betwixt the Riuers 
Kennet
 and 
Tham
sis,
 whither after their
great ouerthrow receiued at 
Inge
efield
 by the hand of King 
Ethelwolfe,
 they retyred for their further
safetie.


(6) This Towne King 
Henry
 the first most stately beautified with a rich 
Monastery
 and strong

Castle,
 where, in the Collegiate Church of the 
Abbey,
 himselfe and Queene (who lay both veiled
and crowned) with their daughter 
Maud
 the Empresse, called the 
Lady of England,
 were interred, as
the priuate History of the place auoucheth, though others bestow the bodies of these two Queenes
else-where. The Castle King 
Henry
 the second razed to the ground, because it was the refuge for
the followers of King 
Stephen
 From whence the North-pole is raised in Latitude 51 degrees and
40 minutes, and in Longitude from the first West-point obserued by 
Mercator
 19 degrees and
35. minutes.


(7) A Castle and Towne of greater strength and antiquitie was 
Wallingford,
 by 
Antonie
 and

Ptolemie
 called 
Galtena,
 the chiefest Citie of the 
Attribatians,
 whose large circuit, and strong forti∣fications,
shew plainly, that it was a place of the 
Romans
 abode, and since in a conceiued safetie hath


made many very bold, especially when the sparkes of 
Englands
 ciuill dissentions were forced to flame
in case of the 
Crowne
 betwixt 
Maud
 the Empresse and King 
Stephen,
 whither her selfe and associates
resorted as their surest defence.


(8) But of farre greater magnificence and state is the Castle of 
Windsor,
 a most Princely Palace
and Mansion of his Maiestie. I will not with 
Ieffrey
 affirme it to be built by King 
Arthur,
 but with
better authoritie say, it was so thirsted after by the 
Conquerour,
 that by a composition with the Abbat
of 
Westminster,
 whose then it was, he made it to be the Kings Possession, as a Place besides the plea∣sures,
very commodious to entertaine the King In this Castle that victorious Prince King 
Edward

the third was borne; and herein after he had subdued the 
French
 and 
Scots,
 held he at one and the
same time, as his Prisoners, 
Iohn
 King of 
France,
 and 
Dauid
 King of 
Scotland
 Neither was it euer
graced with greater Maiestie then by the institution of the most honourable Order of the Garter,
a signall Ornament of Martiall Prowesse: the inuention thereof some ascribe to be from a Garter
falling from his Queene, or rather from 
Ioan
 Countesse of 
Salisbury,
 a Lady of an incomparable
beautie, as she danced before him, whereat the by-standers sm
ing, he gaue the impresse to checke
all euill conceits, and in golden Letters imbelished the Garter with this French Posie, HONI
SOIT QVI MALY PENSE. And yet that worthy 
Clarenceaux
 alledging the booke of the first
institution, findes the inuention to be more ancient, as when King 
Richard
 the first warred against
the 
Turkes, Saracens, Cypres,
 and 
Acon,
 he girt the legs of certaine choise Knights with a tache of lea∣ther,
which promised a future glory to the wearers. The most Princely Chappell thereof is graced
with the bodies of those two great Kings, 
Henry
 the sixt, and 
Edward
 the fourth, whom the whole
Kingdome was too little to containo, the one of 
Lancaster,
 the other of 
Yorke,
 where they rest now
vnited in one mould, with a branch of both those Houses, euen King 
Henry
 the eight, who there ly∣eth
also interred, and rests in the Lord.



(9) Other places of note in this Shire are 
Sinodum
 in the North, and 
Watham
 in the East, both
of them places of the 
Romans
 residence, as by their monyes these oftentimes found appeareth. Nei∣ther
was 
Sunning
 the least in this Tract, that had beene the Seat of eight Bishops before the See was
translated thence vnto 
Shirburne,
 or that to 
Salisbury▪ Wantage
 also is not wanting of honour, in
bringing to life that learned and most valiant King 
Ealfred,
 the scourge of the 
Danes,
 and great 
Mo∣narch

of the 
English.
 And 
Finchhamsted
 for wonder inferiour to none, where (as our Writers doe
witnesse) that in the yeare, a thousand one hundred, a Well boyled vp with streames of bloud, and
fifteene dayes together continued that 
Spring,
 whose waters made red all others where they came,
to the great amazement of the beholders.


(10) The riches and sweet seats that this Country affordeth, made many deuout persons to shew
their deuotions vnto true pietie, in erecting places for Gods diuine seruice, and their exemptions
from all worldly businesse: such were 
Abington, Redding, Bysham, Bromehall, Hen
ey, Hamme,
 and

Wallingford,
 whose 
V
tarie
 abusing the intents of their Founders, ouerthrew both their owne Or∣ders
and places of professions; all which were dissolued by 
Act
 of 
Parliament,
 and giuen the King to
dispose at his will.


This Shires diuision is into twentie Hundreds, and hath beene strengthened with six strong Ca∣stles,
is yet graced with three of his Maiesties most Princely Houses, and traded with twelue Market
Townes, and is replenished with one hundred and fortie Parishes.













MIDDLESEX.
CHAPTER XIIII.


MIDDLESEX, so called in regard of the situation, as seated betwixt the 
West-Saxons
 and

East-Angles,
 was sometimes, together with 
Essex
 and 
Hartford-shire,
 that part and portion
which the 
East Saxons
 enioyed for their Kingdome: it lyeth bordered vpon the North
with 
Hartford shire;
 vpon the West by 
Colne,
 is seuered from 
Buckingham;
 the South, by

Thamesis
 from 
Surrey
 and 
Kent;
 and on the East from 
Essex,
 by the Riuer 
Lea.


(2) The length thereof extended from 
 in the East, to 
Morehall
 vpon 
Colne
 in the West,
is by measure nineteene English miles; and from 
South
 
 in the North, to his Majesties Man∣nour
of 
Hampton-Court
 in the South, are little aboue sixteene miles, the whole Circumference ex∣tending
to ninetie miles


(3) In fo
e it is almost square, for ayre passing temperate, for soile abundantly fertile, and for
pasturage and graine of all kindes yeelding the best, so that the Wheat of this Countie hath serued
a long time for the manch
t to our Princes Table.


(4) It lyeth seated in a vale most wholesome and rich hauing some hils also, and them of good

, from whose tops the prospect of the whole is seene like vnto 
Zoar
 in 
Egypt,
 or rather like a
Paradise and Garden of God.


(5) The ancient Inhabitants knowne to 
Caesar,
 were the 
Trinobants,
 whom he nameth to be the
most puissant in the Iland; whose chiefe Citie and State yeelding him subiection, made the whole,
with lesse losse to the 
Romans,
 to beare the yoke of their owne bondage, and to come in vnder
termes of truce. But when their forces in these parts were spent, and the Empire shaken by intestine


warres, the 
Saxons
 setting their eyes vpon so faire a soile, made their footing as sure herein; which
lastly with 
Hartford
 and 
Essex,
 was the portion of the 
East-Saxons
 Kingdome.


(6) Fiue Princely Houses, inheritable to the 
English
 Crowne, are seated in this Shire, which are,

Enfield, Hanworth, White-hall,
 S. 
Iames,
 and 
Hampton-Court,
 a Citie rather in shew then the Palace of
a Prince, and for stately 
Port
 and gorgeous building, not inferiour to any in 
Europe.
 At 
Thistleworth

once stood the Palace of 
Richard
 King of the 
Romans,
 Earle of 
Cornewall,
 which the 
Lond
ner
 in a
tumultuous broile, burned to the ground: many other stately Houses of our 
English
 Nobilitie,
Knights, and Gentlemen, as also of the worshipfull Citizens of 
London,
 are in this Shire so sump∣tuously
built and pleasantly seated, as the like in the like circuit are no where else to be found.
Neere vnto 
Thamesis
 entrance into this Countie, is kept the remembrance of 
Caesars
 entrance ouer

Thamesis,
 by the name of 
Coway
-Stakes, stucke fast in the bottome to impeach his designes; and fur∣ther
at 
Stanes
 a Maire-stone once stood for a marke of Iurisdiction, that 
London
 had so farre vpon

Thamesis


(7) Which Citie is more ancient then any true record beareth, fabuled from 
Brute, Troynouant,

from 
Lud, Ludstone:
 But by more credible Writers, 
Tacitus, Ptolemy,
 and 
Antonine, Londinium,
 by

Aminian
 Mercellinus
 for her successiue prosperitie, 
Augusta,
 the greatest title that can be giuen to
any: by 
Britaines, Londayn,
 by Strangers, 
Londra,
 and by vs 
London.
 This Citie doth shew as the

Cedars
 among other trees, being the seat of the 
British Kings,
 the chamber of the 
English,
 the modell
of the Land, and the Mart of the world: for thither are brought the silke of 
Asia,
 the spices from 
A∣frica,

the Balmes from 
Grecia,
 and the riches of both the 
Indies
 East and West: no Citie standing so
long in same, nor any for diuine and politicke gouernment may with her be compared Her walls
were first set by great 
Constantine
 the first 
Christian Emperour,
 at the suit of his mother, Qu: 
Helen,

reared with rough stone and 
British
 Bricke three English miles in compasse: thorow which are now


made seauen most faire gates, besides three other passages for entrance. Along the 
Thamesis,
 this wall
at first ranged and with two gates opened, the one 
Doure-gate,
 now 
Dowgate,
 and the other 
Billins∣gate,

a receptacle for Ships. In the midst of this wall was set a mile-marke (as the like was in 
Rome)

from whence were measured their stations, for carriage or otherwise; the same as yet standeth, and
hath beene long knowne by the name of 
London Stone.
 Vpon the East of this Citie, the Church of
S. 
Peters
 is thought to be the Cathedrall of 
Restitus,
 the Christians Bishops See, who liued in the
raigne of Great 
Constantine;
 but since S. 
Pauls
 in the West part, from the Temple of 
Diana,
 assu∣med
that dignitie, whose greatnesse doth exceed any other at this day, and spires so high that twice
it hath beene consumed by lightning from heauen. Besides this Cathedrall, God is honoured in
one hundred twentie one Churches more in this Citie: that is, ninetie six within the wals; sixteene
without, but within the Liberties; and nine more in her Suburbs; and in 
F
z. Stephens
 time, thir∣teene
Conuents of religious Orders. It is diuided into 26 Wards, gouerned by so many graue 
Al∣dermen,

a 
Lord Maior,
 and two 
Sherifs,
 the yearely choice whereof was granted them by Patent from
King 
Iohn;
 in whose time also a Bridge of stone was made ouer 
Thames,
 vpon nineteene Arches, for
length, breadth, beautie, and building, the like againe not found in the world.


(8) This 
London
 (as it were) disdaning bondage, hath set her selfe on each side, far without the
walls, and hath lefther West-gate in the midst, from whence with continuall buildings (still affec∣ting
greatnesse) she hath continued her streets vnto a Kings Palace, and ioyned a second Citie to
her selfe, famous for the Seat and Sepulchre of our Kings; and for the Gates of Iustice, that termely
there are opened, onely once a Bishops See, whose title died with the man. No walls are set about
this Citie, and those of 
London
 are left, to shew rather what it was, then what it is: Whose Citizens,
as the 
Lacedemonians
 did, doe impute their strength in their men, and not in their wals, how strong
toeuer. Or else for their multitude, cannot be circulated, but (as another 
Ierusalem)
 is inhabited


without walls, as 
Zachary
 said. The wealth of this Citie (as 
Isay
 once spake of 
Nilus)
 growes from
the Reuenewes and haruest of her South-bounding 
Thames;
 whose traffique for merchandizing, is
like that of 
Tyrus,
 whereof 
Ezekiel
 speakes, and stands in abundance of Siluer, Iron, Tinne, and
Lead, &c. And from 
London
 her channell is nauigable, straitned along with medowing borders,
vntill she taketh her full libertie in the 
German
 Seas. Vpon this 
Thamesis
 the Ships of 
Tharsis
 seeme
to ride, and the Nauy, that rightly is termed the 
Lady
 of the Sea, spreads her saile. Whence twice
with luckie successe hath beene accomplished, the compassing of the vniuersall Globe. This Riuer,

Canutus,
 laying siege against 
London,
 sought by digging to diuert, and before him the 
Danes
 had done
great harmes in this Citie, yet was their State recouered by King 
Elfred,
 and the Riuer kept her olde
course, notwithstanding that cost. In the times of the 
Normans,
 some ciuill broiles haue beene at∣tempted
in this Citie, as in the dayes of King 
Iohn,
 whereinto his Barons entred, and the Tower
yeelded vnto 
Lewis.
 And againe, 
Wat Tyler
 herein committed outragious cruelties, but was wor∣thily
struck downe by the 
Maior
 and slaine in 
Smithfield.
 This Cities graduation for Latitude is the
degree 51. 45. minutes, and in Longitude 20. degrees 39. minutes.


(9) In this Countie at 
Barnet,
 vpon Easter-day, a bloudy battell was fought, betwixt 
Henry
 the
sixt and 
Edward
 the fourth, wherein were slaine one Marques, one Earle, three Lords, and with
them ten thousand 
Englishmen.


(10) The diuision of this Shire is into seuen Hundreds, wherein are seated two Cities, foure
Market-Townes, and seuenty-three Parish-Churches, besides them in 
London;
 wherein the Church
of 
Gray-Fryers,
 now called 
Christ-Church,
 three Queenes lye interred, which were, Queene 
Marga∣ret,

the D. of 
Phil.
 the hardy, King of 
France,
 second wife to King 
Edward
 the first; the second was
Queene 
Isabel,
 wife to King 
Edward
 the second, and D. to 
Philip
 the faire King of 
France;
 and the
third was Queene 
Ioan,
 their daughter, married to 
Dauid
 King of 
Scotland.














ESSEX.
CHAPTER XV.


ESSEX, by the 
Normans exsessa,
 and by the vulgar 
Essex;
 is a Countie large in compasse, very
populous, and nothing inferiour to the best of the Land.


(2) The 
orme thereof is somewhat Circular, excepting the East part, which shooteth her
selfe with many Promontories into the Sea; and from 
Horsey Iland
 to 
Haidon
 in the West,
(the broadest part of the Shire) are by measure fortie miles; and the length from 
East-Ha

vpon 
Thamesis
 in the South, to 
S
urmere
 vpon the Riuer 
Stow
 in the North, are thirtie-fiue miles;
the whole in Circumference one hundred fortie sixe miles.


(3) It lyeth bounded vpon the North, with 
Suffolke
 and 
Cambridge-Shires,
 vpon the West with

Hertford
 and 
Middlesex,
 vpon the South by 
Thamesis
 is parted from 
Kent,
 and the East-side thereof
is altogether washed with the 
German Sea.


(4) The ayre is temperate and pleasant onely towards the waters somewhat aguish: the soile is
rich and fruitfull, though in some places sandy and barren; yet so that it neuer frustrates the husband∣mans
hopes, or fils not the hands of her haruest-labourers: but in some part so fertile, that after three
yeares glebe of Saffron, the Land for 18. more, will yeeld plentie of Barley, without either dung or
other fatning earth


(5) Her ancient Inhabitants knowne to the 
Romanes,
 were by 
Caesar
 called the 
Trinobants,
 of
whom in the former 
Chapter
 we haue spoken, and in our 
History
 shall speake more at large. But this
name perished with the age of the Empire, the 
Saxons
 presently framed a new; and with 
Hertford
 and

Middlesex
 made it their 
East-Saxons
 Kingdome, vntill that 
Egbert
 brought this and the whole into
an entire and absolute Monarchy: the 
Daues
 after them laid so sore for this Prouince, that at 
eam∣fleet



and 
Hauenet
 (now 
Shobery)
 they fortified most strongly; and at 
Barklow,
 (besides the hils moun∣ted
for their burials) the 
Danewort
 with her red beryes, so plentifully grow, that it is held and ac∣counted
to spring from the bloud of the 
Danes
 which in that place was spilt, and the hearb as yet is
called from them the 
Danes-bloud;
 neither yet were they quelled to surcease that quarrell; but at 
Ash∣downe

abode the 
Iron-side
 in fight, wherein so much bloud of the 
English
 was spilt, that 
Canutus
 their
King in remorse conscience, built a Church in the place, to pacifie God for the sinnes of his peo∣ple:
But when the 
Normans
 had got the garland of the whole, many of their Nobles there seated them∣selues,
whose posterities since, both there and else-where, are spread further abroad in the Realme.


(6) The Commodities that this Shire yeeldeth, are many and great, as of Woods, Corne, Cat∣tle,
Fish, Forests, and Saffron; which last groweth with such gaine and increase vpon her North
parts, that from a split cloue much like vnto Garlicke, a white blewish Flower shortly springeth,
from whence fillets of Saffron are gathered before the Sunne, and dryed, are sold as spice with great
gaine. From the Ilands 
Canuey, Mersey, Horsey, Northly, Osey, Wallot,
 and 
Foulnesse,
 great store of
Fish and Fowle are daily gotten: and so from their Cattle haue they continuall increase, which men
and boyes milke; as well the Ewe as the Kine; whereof they make great and thicke Cheese, sold a∣broad
in the Land, and much thereof transported into other Countries. Their Oysters which we
call 
Walfleete,
 the best in esteeme, and are thought from 
Pa
e
 to haue beene serued in the 
Romans

Kitchins. But least we should exceed measure in commending, or the people repose their trust in the
soyle; behold what God can doe, to frustrate both in a moment, and that by his meanest creatures:
for in our age and remembrance, the yeare of Christ 1581. an Army of 
Mice
 so ouer ranne the
Marshes in 
Dengey Hundred,
 neere vnto 
South-minster
 in this Countie, that they shore the grasse to
the very roots, and so tainted the same with their venemous teeth, that a great Murraine fell vpon
the Cattle which grased thereon, to the great losse of their owners.



(7) The chiefest Citie for account at this day, in this Shire, is 
Colchester,
 built by 
Coilus
 the 
Brit∣ish

Prince, one hundred twentie-foure yeares after the birth of our 
Sauiour Christi
 (if he of 
Mo
mouth

say true) wherein his sonne 
Lucius, Helena,
 and 
Constantine,
 the first Christian 
King, Empresse,
 and

Emperour
 in the world, were borne: which made 
Necham
 for 
Consiantine
 to sing as he did.


From 
Colchester
 there rose a Starre,


The Rayes whereof gaue glorious light


Throughout the world in climates farre,


Great 
Constantine, Romes
 Emperour bright.


And the 
Romanes
 to the great honour of 
Helena
 inscribed her, 
Pi
ssima Venerabilis Augusta.
 But
of these we shall be occasioned to speake more hereafter. This Citie is situated vpon the South of
the Riuer 
Coln;
 from whence it hath the name, and is walled about, raised vpon a high Trench of
earth, though now much decayed, hauing six gates of entrance, and three posternes in the West wall,
besides nine Watch-Towers for defence, and containeth in compasse 1980 paces; wherein stand
eight faire Churches, and two other without the walls, for Gods diuine seruice: S 
Tenants
 and the

Blacke Fryers
 decayed in the Suburbs; 
Mary Magdalins,
 the 
Nunnery,
 S 
Iohns,
 and the 
Cruched Fry∣ers,

all suppressed: within towards the East is mounted an old Castle, and elder ruines vpon a trench
containing two Acres of ground, whereas yet may be seene the prouident care they had against all
ensuing assaults.


The trade of this Towne standeth chiefly in making of Cloth and Baies, with Saies, and other
like Stuffes daily inuented; and is gouerned by two Bailiffes, twelue Aldermen, all wearing Scarlet;
a Recorder, a Towne-Clerke, and foure Sergeants at Mace. Whose position for Latitude is in the
degree 52. 14. minutes; and for Longitude, in the degree 21. and 50. minutes.



(8) Places of antiquitie and memorable note in this Countie, I obserue the most famous to be

Camalodumum,
 by vs 
Maldon,
 which was the Royall Seat of 
Cunobel
 King of the 
Trino
antes,
 as by
his money therein minted appeareth, about the time of our 
Sauiours
 birth: which Citie afterwards

Claudius
 wonne from the 
Britaines,
 and therein placed a Colony of Souldiers, which were called

Victricensis.
 This Citie Queene 
Boduo,
 in reuenge of her wrongs, raced to the ground, what time
she stirred their people against 
Nero,
 with the slaughter of seuentie thousand of the 
Romanes.
 Of some
later and lesser account was 
Ithanchester,
 now S. 
Peters
 vpon the wall, where the 
Forteuses
 with their
Captaine kept, towards the declination of the 
Romane Empire.
 In the East Promontory of this Coun∣tie,
in the Raigne of 
Richard
 the second, the teeth of a Giant were found (if they were not of an 
E∣lephant)

of a marueilous size (saith 
Raph Coggeshall)
 and not farre thence, in the raigne of 
Elizabeth,

more bones to the like wonder were digged vp.


(9) I purposely omit the message of a Pilgrim from S. 
Iohn Baptist,
 by whom he sent a Ring to
King 
Edward Confessor;
 for which cause his house tooke the name 
Hauering:
 seeing the Monkes of
those times made no great daintie daily to forge matter for their owne aduantage: who in this Shire
so swarmed that they had houses erected at 
Waltham, Pritlewell, Tiltey, Dun
ow, Leeye, Hatfeild Pe∣uerell,
Chelmesford, Coggeshall, Maldon, Earls. coln, Col
hester, S Osths, Saffron-Walden, Hatfield-Bra∣docke,

and more, with great reuenewes thereto belonging; all which felt the Axes and Hammers
of destruction, when the rest of such foundations fell vnder the 
ile of King 
Henry
 the eight, who
with 
Hezekiah
 brake downe all these Brazen Serpents.


(10) This Shire is diuided into 20. Hundreds, wherein are seated 21 Market-Townes, 5. Ca∣ttles,
5. Hauens, 2 of his Majesties Mannours, and 415. Parish-Churches.













SVFFOLKE.
CHAPTER XVI.


SVFFOLKE, in regard of them which were seated in 
Norfolke,
 is a Country most plenteous and
pleasant for habitation. It is separated from 
Norfolke,
 by the Riuers of the lesser 
Ouse,
 and 
Waue∣ney,

whose heads meet almost in the midst of her Verge, and that very neere together: the one
taking course 
East,
 and the other full 
West,
 vpon which part 
Cambridge-shire
 doth wholly con∣front.
The South side is seuered by 
Stoure
 from 
Essex,
 and the East together washed with the

Germane Seas.


(2) The Ayre is good, sweet, and delectable, and in some parts, of some of our best Physitians,
held to be the best in the Land: the Soile is rich, fruitfull, and with all things well replenished; in a
word, nothing wanting for pleasure of profit.


(3) The forme thereof is some what 
Cressant,
 shooting vp narrower into the 
North,
 and spreading
wider towards the 
South,
 whose broadest part is about twentie miles: but from East to West much
more; for from 
Easton
 point (the furthest of this Shire, yea of all 
Britaine
 into the Sea) vnto great

Ouse
 Riuer, her Westerne bounder, are fortie fiue miles, and the whole in circumference, about one
hundred fortie sixe miles.


(4) Anciently this part of the 
Iland
 was possessed by the 
Iceni,
 who as it seemeth by 
Tacitus,
 ioy∣ned
in Amitie with the 
Romans, a mightie people
 (saith he) 
and neuer shaken with warres
 before the
raigne of 
Claudius,
 but then by 
Ostorius
 were vanquished, though not without great slaughter of the

Romans;
 and in a Battle against them, 
M. Ostorius
 the sonne of the 
Generall,
 wonne great honour in
sauing of a 
Roman
 Citizens life; so ready were they to giue and receiue Honours to themselues, but
sleightly to passe ouer, and to smoother farre greater exployts of the 
Britaines:
 which notwithstan∣ding


long in these parts they could not doe; for the wrongs of the 
Icenians
 growing intolerable, who
by the 
Romane
 Souldiers were put out of their rightfull possessions, their Princes accounted no bet∣ter
then Slaues, and their Queene whipped in most ignominious manner; vnder 
Boduo
 they wrought
their reuenge, as in the History (Christ assisting) shall be further related.


Next to these 
Icenians,
 were the 
Saxons
 that got their footing into these parts, and of them, this
with 
Norfolke, Cambridge shire,
 and the 
Ile
 of 
Ely,
 was made their 
East-Angles
 Kingdome; though
as it seemeth euer in subiection either to the 
Mercians,
 or to the Kings of 
Kent
 whose off-spring en∣ding
in S 
Edmund
 the Martyr, after the 
Danes
 had laid it most desolate, 
Edward
 the Elder subdued
it vnto his 
West-Saxons
 Monarchy: and that likewise ending in King 
Edward
 the Confessor, many
Noble 
Normans
 got their possessions in these parts, whose off-spring are plenteously replenished in
this Shire to this day.


(5) The commodities of this Shire are many and great, whereof the chiefest consisteth in Corne,
in Cattle, Cloth, Pasturage, Woods, Sea-fish and Fowle; and as 
Abbo Floricensis
 hath depainted,

this Countie is of a greene and passing fresh hue, pleasantly replenished with Orchards, Gardens and Groues

thus he described it aboue six hundred yeares since, and now we finde as he hath said; to which we
may adde their gaine from the Pa
le, whose Cheeses are traded not onely thorowout 
England,
 but
into 
Germany, France,
 and 
Spaine,
 and are highly commended by 
Pantaleon
 the Physitian, both for
colour and taste.


(6) And had 
Ipswich
 (the onely eye of this Shire) beene as fortunate in her Surname, as she is
blessed with Commerce and buildings, she might 
 haue borne the title of a Citie: neither
ranked in the 
 and seat, doth equall most places of the Land be∣


 about, both by a Rampire of earth, mounted along her



North
 and 
West
 parts, and places of entrance where gates haue stood; which no doubt, by the 
Danes

were cast downe, in the yeare of 
Iesus Christ
 991. when they sacked with spoyle all these Sea-coasts:
and againe in the yeare one thousand, laid the streets desolate, and the houses on heapes: yet after∣wards
recouering both breath and beautie, her buildings from 
St
ke-Church
 in the 
South,
 to Saint

Margarets
 in the 
North,
 now containe 19
0 paces, and from S 
Helens
 in the 
East,
 to S. 
Matthewes

Church in the 
West,
 are no lesse then 2120. full of streets plenteously inhabited, wherein are twelue
Parish-Churches seated, besides them suppressed; such were 
Christ-Church,
 S 
Georges,
 S. 
Iames, the
White, the Blacke, and Gray Fryers▪
 The Site of this Towne is remoued from the 
Equator,
 vnto the
degree 52. 25 minutes: and by 
Mercators
 obseruation, from the first 
West points
 22. degrees, 9 mi∣nutes:
and is yearely gouerned by two Bailiffes, and ten Port-men, all wearing Scarlet with twen∣ty-foure
of their Common-Councell in purple: a Recorder, a Towne-Clerke, fiue Sergeants,
whereof one is for the Admiraltie, a Beadle, and Common Cryer, all in blew, with the Townes
Armes on their Sleeue.


The other Eye of this shire is S. 
Edmund
bury. By Abbo
 the Royall Towne, wherein at the day-breake
of the 
Saxons
 conuersion, 
Sigebert
 King of the 
East-Angles
 founded a Christian Church: and
vpon the occasion of King 
Edmounds
 buriall (who at 
Hoxon
 was shot to death) hath beene euer since
called S 
Edmunds-bury,
 where was built to his honour one of the fairest Monasteries in the world,
begun by King 
Canute,
 much affrighted with the seeming appearance of that Martyrs Ghost, who
to expiate the Sacrilegious impietie of his Father 
Suenus,
 enriched the place with many endowments,
and offred vp his owne Crowne vpon the 
 Martyrs Tombe. For the beautie and buildings of
this Abbey and Towne, let 
Leyland
 for me declare: 


finely seated, so delicately, vpon the easie ascent of an hill,
 


stately Abbey, either for reuenewes or incomparable
 




then a Monastery, so many Gates for entrance, and some of them brasse, so many Towers, and a most glo∣rious
Church, vpon which attend three others, standing all in the same Church-yard, all of them passing fine,
and of a curious workmanship.
 Whose ruines lie in the dust, lamenting their fall, mouing the beholders
to pietie their case.


Neere vnto this Towne a great Battle was fought by 
Robert Bossu,
 Earle of 
Leicester,
 against his
Soueraigne King 
Henry
 the second: but was worthily ouercome by 
Richard Lucy,
 the Kings high
Iustice, himselfe and wife taken, with many Flemings and Englishmen slaine.


(7) Other places worthy of remembrance this Countie affords; such is 
Ex
ing
 in the West,
formerly famous for the birth of S. 
Andrey,
 daughter to King 
Anna,
 one of the three names of the
Shires diuision. 
Rendl
sham
 in the East, where 
Redwald
 the first Christian in this Kingdome held
his Court: and 
Hadley
 in her South, where 
Guthrum
 the 
Dane
 whom 
Elfred
 baptized, was buried.
And things of stranger note are the limits of the 
East-Angles
 Territories, running along 
New-market

heath, vulgarly called the 
Diuels-ditch:
 the like fable is formally told by 
Nubrigensis,
 that at 
Wulpet

in the heart of this Shire, two greene boyes of 
Satyres
 kinde arose out of the ground, from the 
An∣tipodes;

beleeue it if you will: and 
Ralfe Coggeshall
 in the Monuments of 
C
l
hester,
 declareth, that a

Fish
 in all parts like a man was taken neere 
Orford,
 and for sixe moneths was kept in the Castle,
whence after he escaped againe to the Sea.


As strange, but most true, was a crop of Pease, that without tillage or sowing grew in the Rockes,
betwixt this 
Orford
 and 
Aldebrough,
 in the yeare 1555 when by vnseasonable weather a great dearth
was in the Land: there in 
August
 were gathered aboue one hundred Quarters, and in blossoming re∣mained
as many more, where neuer grasse grew, or earth euer seene, but hard solide Rockes three
yards deepe vnder their rootes.



(8) Places separated from common vse, and deuoted to God and his seruice by religious Prin∣ces,
were at S. 
Edmunds, Ipswich, Ikleworth, Blithborow, Clare, Iaeston, Burgh
 Castle, wherein 
Sigebert

King of the 
East-Angles
 entered the profession of a Monke: but was thence forced by his people, to
fight against the 
Mercians:
 in which Battle he was slaine. And 
Dunwich,
 where 
Foelix
 founded his
Episcopall See. These with many others in this Countie were suppressed in the fall of the Mona∣steries,
and their Reuenewes assumed by King 
Henry
 the Eight.


(9) This Shire is principally diuided into three parts, which are called the 
Celdable,
 S. 
Edmunds,

and S. 
Audreys
 Liberties, subdiuided into twentie-two Hundreds and them againe into 575. Pa∣rish-Churches,
wherein are seated seauen Castles, and twentie-eight Market-Townes.













NORTHFOLKE.
CHAPTER XVII.


NORTHFOLKE is an Iland inclining to an ouall forme, closed on the South part with the
Riuers of 
Waueney
 and the l
sser 
Ouse,
 which diuides it from 
Suffolke.
 On the East and
North with the 
Germane Ocean;
 on the West toward 
Cambridge-shire,
 with some branches
of the greater 
Ouse;
 toward 
Lincolne-shire
 with that part of the 
neue
 which passeth from 
Wis∣bitch

into the 
Washes.


It containeth in length (from 
Yarmouth
 to 
Wisbitch)
 about fiftie miles▪ In breadth (from 
Thet∣ford

to 
Wels)
 about thirtie. The whole Circuit is about two hundred fortie two miles.


The Name ariseth from the situation of the people, who being the Norther-most of the King∣dome
of 
East-Angles,
 are therefore called the 
Northfolke,
 as the Souther-most of the 
Southfolke▪


The Ayre is sharpe and piercing, especially in the Champion, and neere the Sea
 therefore it de∣laieth
the Spring and Haruest, the situation of the Country inclining thereto, as being vnder the 53.
degree of Latitude.


The So
e diuers: about the Townes commonly good; as Clay; Chalke, or sa
 earth, well wate∣red,
and with some wood: vpward to the Heaths naked, dry, and barren: 
Marsland
 and 
Flegg
 excee∣ding
rich; but 
Marsland
 properly for Pastere, 
Flegg
 for Corne.


(2) The parts from 
Thetford
 to 
Buruham,
 and thence Westward, as also along the Coast, be
counted 
Champion:
 the rest (as better furnished with woods) 
Woodland.
 The 
Champion
 aboundeth
with Corne, Sheepe, and Conies, and here in the barren Heaths (as the prouidence of our Ancestors
hath of old disposed them) are very profitable. For on them principally lie our 
Fould courses,
 called


of the 
Saxons
 (whose institution they therefore seeme to be) 
Paldyoeun,
 that is, 
Libertie of fold or foul∣dage.

These Heaths by the Compasture of the sheepe (which we call 
Tath:)
 are made so rich with
Corne, that when they fall to be sowne, they commonly match the fruitfullest grounds in other
Countries and laid againe, doe long after yeeld a sweeter and more plentifull feed for sheepe: so
that each of them maintaine other, and are the chiefest wealth of our Country. The 
Woodland
 (fitter
for grasse) is maintained chiefly by feeding of Cattell, yet well stored with Corne and Sheepe.


The Coast is fortunate in Fish▪ and hath many good Harbours, whereof 
Lenn
 and 
Yarmouth
 be the
mother-ports, and of great traffique: 
Wels
 and 
Blakeney
 next in estimation.


The whole Countie aboundeth with Riuers and pleasant Springs, of which the 
Ouse
 is chiefest,
by whose plentifull branches, the Isle of 
Fly,
 the Townes and Shires of 
Cambridge, Humington,
 and
the Countie of 
Suffolke
 vent and receiue Commodities. The next is 
Hierus
 or 
Yere,
 passing from

Norwich
 to 
Yarmouth,
 where it receiueth the 
Bure
 comming from 
Aylsham,
 both of them of great
seruice for water-carriages, but very notable for their plenty of 
 for some one man out of an hold
vpon the 
Bure,
 hath drawne vp ordinarily once a yeare, betweene two Nets, about fiue or six score
busness of Fish at one draught. The 
Waueney
 and the lesser 
Ouse
 are also Nauigable and of great
vse. The residue I omit.


(3) I he people were anciently called ICENI, as they also of 
Suffolke, Cambridge-shire,
 and

Huntington-shire,
 and supposed to be of them whom 
Caesar
 nameth 
Cenimagni; Ptolemie, Simeni;
 some

T
gens.
 Their manners were likely to be as the rest of the 
Britaines,
 barbarous at those times, as ap∣peareth
by 
Caesar
 and 
Tacitus,
 Neither can I otherwise commend their Successors the 
Saxons:
 for so
also their owne Countryman 
Ethelwerd
 termeth them. Since the entry of the 
Normans,
 they haue
beene accounted ciuill and ingenious, apt to good Letters, adorning Religion with more Churches
and Monasteries, then any Shire of 
England,
 and the Lawes and Seats of Iustice (for many ages)


with some excellent men; from whom most of our chiefe Families, and some of the greatest Nobi∣lity
of the Kingdome, haue taken aduancement And herein is 
Northfolke
 fortunate, that as 
Crete
 boa∣sted
of an hundred Cities, so may she of an hundred Families of Gentlemen, neuer yet attainted of
high Treason. How the gouernment of this Country was about 
Caesars
 time, is vncertaine, but (a∣greeable
no doubt to the rest of the 
Britaines)
 vnder some peculiar 
Toparch
 or 
Regulus,
 as 
Tacitus
 ter∣meth
him. The latter 
Romans
 held it by two 
Garrisons,
 one at 
Gariannum
 neere 
Yarmouth;
 the other
at 
Branedunum,
 now called 
Brancastre,
 both of horse, and commanded by the 
Comes Maritims Tractus,

as 
Marcellinus
 calleth him, termed after 
Comes Littoris Saexonici
 Vpon the entry of the 
Saxons,
 this
Countie with 
Suffolke
 fell in the portion of the 
Angles,
 and about the yeare fiue hundred sixtie one,
were together erected into a Kingdome by 
Vffa,
 of whom the succeeding Kings were tituled 
Vffines.

But hauing suffred many Tempests of 
Fortune,
 it was in the yeare 870. vtterly wasted and extinct by

Hungar
 and 
Hubba
 the 
Danes,
 who ouerthrew the vertuous King 
Edmund
 about 
Thetford,
 and after
martyred him at S. 
Edmundsbury.
 Yet they did not long enioy it: for King 
Edward
 shortly recoue∣red
it from them, and annexed it to his other Kingdomes. The 
Danes
 notwithstanding inhabited a∣bundantly
in these parts, so that many of our Townes were founded by them, and a great part of
our people and Gentry are risen out of their bloud.


(4) This Kingdome of 
East-Angles
 was after allotted to an Earledome of that name by 
Willi∣am
the Conquerour,
 who made 
Radulph
 a 
Britaine,
 marying his kinswoman, Earle thereof; but gaue
the greatest parts of this Countie about 
Wimondham, Keninghall, Lenn, Buruham, Fulmerstone,
 &c. to

W. de Albany, Pincernae,
 and 
W de Warranna Forrestario,
 who to strengthen themselues (according to
the vse of that time) with the homage and seruice of many tenants, diuided large portions of the
same amongst their friends and followers; so that most of the Manours and Lands in the parts a∣foresaid,
were in those dayes either mediately or immediately holden of one of them. And as 
North∣folke



and 
Suffolke
 were first vnited in a Kingdome, then in an Earledome, so they continued vnited
in the 
Sheriffe-wicke
 till about the fifteenth yeare of Queene 
Elizabeth.


(5) The Townes here are commonly well built, and populous; three of them being of that
worth and qualitie, as no one Shire of 
England
 hath the like, 
Norwich, Lenn,
 and 
Yarmouth:
 to which
for ancient reputation (as hauing beene a seat of the Kings of 
East-Angles)
 I may adde 
Thetford,

knowne to 
Antonius, Ptolemie,
 and elder ages, by the name of 
Sitemagus,
 when the other three were
yet in their infancie, and of no esteeme: for I accept not the Relations of the Antiquitie and State of

Norwich
 in the time of the 
Britaine
 and 
Saxons,
 though 
Alexander Neuil
 hath well graced them. Her
very name abridgeth her Antiquitie, as hauing no other in Histories but 
Norwich,
 which is meere

Saxon
 or 
Danish,
 and signifieth the 
North-Towne
 or 
Castle.
 It seemeth to haue risen out of the decay
of her neighbour 
Vinta,
 now called 
Castor,
 and as M. 
Cambden
 noteth, not to haue beene of mar

before the entry of the 
Danes,
 who in the yeare 1004. vnder 
Sweno
 their Captaine, first sackt, and
then burnt it, euen in her infancie▪ Yet in the dayes of 
Edward the Confessor
 it recouered 1320.
Burgesset. But maintaining the cause of Earle 
Radulph
 aforesaid against the 
Conquerour,
 they were by
famine and sword wasted to 560 at which time the Earle escaping by ship, his wife vpon composi∣tion
yeelded the Castle, and followed 
 
William Rusu
 time it was growne famous for Merchandise
and concourse of people; so that 
Herbert
 then translating the Bishopricke from 
Thetford
 thither,
made each of them an ornament to other. In varietie of times it felt much varietie of 
Fortune:
 By
fire in 
Anno
 1508. By extreame plagues, whereof one in 
An.
 1348. was so outragious, as 17104.
are reported to haue died thereof betweene the 
Calends
 of 
Ianuary
 and of 
Iuly.
 By misery of warre,
as sacked and spoyled by the Earle of 
Flaunders
 and 
Hugh Big
d,
 Anno 1174. In yeelding to 
Lewis

the 
French,
 against their naturall Lord King 
Iohn,
 Anno 1216. By the disinherited Barons, 
An.
 1266.
By tumult and insurrection betweene the Citizens and Church-men: once about the yeare 1265.


which if 
Henry
 the third had not come in person to appease, the Citie was in hazard to be ruined:
The second time in 
Anno
 1446. for which the Major was deposed, and their Liberties for a while
selfed. In 
Edward
 the sixths time, by 
Ketts
 rebellion, whose fury chiefly raged against this Citie.
Since this it hath flourished with the blessings of 
Peace,
 Plentie, Wealth and 
Honour:
 so that 
Alxan∣der
Neu
 doubteth not to preferre it aboue all the Cities of 
England,
 except 
London.
 It is situate vp∣on
the Riuer 
Hierus,
 in a 
 valley, but on using ground, hauing on the East the Hilles and
Heath called 
Mussold
 for 
Most-would,
 as I take it. In the 17 yeare of King 
Stephen
 it was new foun∣ded,
and made a Corporation▪ In 
Edward
 the firsts time, closed with a same Wall, 
auing on a part
that the Riuer defendeth. First gouerned by foure Bayliffes; then by 
Henry
 the fourth in 
An
 1403.
erected into a Majoraltie and County; the limits whereof now extend to 
Eatonb
ge▪
 At this
present it hath about thirtie Parishes, but in ancient time had many more.


(6) 
Lenn
 hauing beene an ancient Borrough vnder the Gouernment of a Bayliffe or Reue, called

Praepositus,
 was by King 
Iohn
 in the sixt yeare of his Raigne made 
Liber Burgus,
 and (besides the gift
of his memorable Cup, which to this day honoureth this Corporation) endowed with diuers faire
Liberties. King 
Henry
 the third in the 17 yeare of his Raigne (in recompence of their seruice a∣gainst
the out-lawed 
Barons
 in the Isle of 
Ely)
 enlarged their Charter, and granted them further,
to choose a Major 
Loco Prapositi:
 vnto whom King 
Henry
 the Eight, in the sixteenth yeare of his
Raigne, added twelue Aldermen, a Recorder, and other Officers, and the bearing of a sword be∣fore
the Major. But the Towne comming after to the same 
King,
 he in the twentie-ninth of his
Raigne, changed their name, from 
Mator & Burge
ses Lenn Episcopi,
 to 
Mator & Burge
ses Lenn Re∣gis.


(7) 
Yarmouth
 is the Key of the Coast, named and seated by the mouth of the Riuer 
Yere.
 Begun
in the time of the 
V
nes,
 and by small accessions growing populous, made a Corporation vnder two


Bayliffes by King 
Henry
 the third▪ and by his Charter, about the fifteenth yeare of his Raigne, wal∣led
It▪ It is an ancient member of the 
Ci
que Ports,
 very well built and fortified, hauing onely one
Church (but faire and large) founded by Bishope 
Herbert,
 in 
William Rufus
 dayes. It maintaineth a
Peere against the Sea, at the yearely charge of fiue hundred pound, or thereabout: yet hath it no
possessions, as other Corporations, but like the children of 
Aeol
 and 
Thetis: Maria & 4. ventos,

as an Inquisitor findeth 
An. 10. Hen
 3. There is yearely in 
September
 the worthiest. Herring-fishing
in 
Europe,
 which draweth great concourse of people, and maketh the Towne much the richer all the
yeare, but very vnsauoury for the time. The Inhabitants are so curteous, as they haue long held a
custome to feast all persons of worth, repairing to their Tovvne.


(8) The Bishopricke of 
Norwich
 had first hereseat at 
Dunwich
 in 
Suffolke,
 and was there begun by

Foelix,
 who conuerted this Countie, and the 
East-Angles)
 to the Faith. Being brought out of 
Burgun∣die

by 
Sigeber
 (the first Christian King of the 
East-Angles)
 he landed at 
Babingley
 by 
Lenn,
 and
there builded the first Church of these Countries, which in his memory, is at this day called by his
Name. The second he built at 
Shar
bourn
 then of wood, and therefore called 
Stock-Chappell.
 Af∣ter

Foelix
 and three of his Successors, this Bishopricke was diuided into two Sees: the one with ele∣uen
Bishops in succession, continuing at 
Dunwich;
 the other with twelue at 
Elmham
 in 
Norfolke.

Then vnited againe in the time of King 
Edwyn,
 the entire See for twelue other Bishops remained at

Elmham,
 and in the 
Conquerours
 time was by his Chaplaine 
Arfastus
 (being the thirteenth) translated
to 
Thetford,
 from thence by 
Herbert
 (his next Successor saue one) bought of 
W. Rusus
 for 1900.
pounds, and brought to 
Norwich.
 This 
Herbert
 (surnamed 
Losinga
 a 
Norman)
 builded the Cathedrall
Church there, and endowed it with large possessions. Not far from thence he also builded another
Church to S. 
Leonard,
 a third at 
Elmham,
 a fourth at 
Lenn,
 (S. 
Margarets,
 a very faire one) and the


fifth at 
Yarmouth
 before mentioned. By the Cathedrall Church he builded a Palace for the Bishops,
and founded the Priory there (now conuerted to 
Deane
 and 
Chapter)
 and another Priory at 
Thet∣ford.

Since his time the Bishops See hath immoueably remained at 
Norwich,
 but the ancient Pos∣session
are seuered from it, and in lieu thereof the Abbey and Lands of S 
Benedict
 of 
Holme
 annexed
to it. The Commodities of this Countie I haue contained in these four Verses.


Ingenio & populi cultu Norfolcia clari est;


Hinc fluvijs, illine Insula clausa mari;


Qua ratis, & vellus, frumenta, cuniculus, agnus.


Lac scatet, & pisces, pabula, mella, crocus.


This Description of 
Northfolke,

CAMBRIDGE-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XVIII.


CAMBRIDGE-SHIRE, lyeth bounded vpon the North with 
Lincolneshire
 and 
Northfolke;

vpon the East with 
Norfolke
 and 
Suffolke;
 vpon the South with 
Hartford-shire
 and 
Essex;
 and
vpon the West with 
Bedford
 and 
Huntington shires.


(2) This Prouince is not large, nor for ayre greatly to be liked, hauing the Fennes so
spread vpon her North, that they infect the ayre far into the rest: From whose furthest point
vnto 
Royston
 in the South, are thirtie-fiue miles; but in the broadest is not fully twentie: the whole
in Circumference, traced by the compasse of her many indents, one hundred twentie and eight
miles.


(3) The Soile doth differ both in ayre and commodities; the Fenny surcharged with waters:
the South is Champion, and yeeldeth 
Corne
 in abundance, with 
Meadowing. Pastures
 vpon both the
sides of the Riuer 
Came,
 which diuides that part of the Shire in the midst, vpon whose 
East-bancks

the 
Muses
 haue built their most sacred 
Seat,
 where with plenteous increase they haue continued for
these many hundred yeares.


(4) For from ancient 
Grantcester, Camboritum
 by 
Antonine,
 now famous 
Cambridge,
 the other
brest and 
Nurse-mother
 of all pious literature, haue flowed full steames of the learned 
Sciences
 into
all other parts of this Land, and else-where: ancient indeed, if their 
Story
 be rightly writ, that will
haue it built by 
Cantaber
 a 
Spaniard,
 three hundred seauenty fiue yeares before the birth of our 
Saui∣our,

who thither first brought and planted the 
Muses.
 This Citie 
Grantcester
 by the tyranny of time
lost both her owne beautie and her professed 
Athenian Students,
 so that in 
Bedaes
 dayes, seauen hun∣dred
yeares after the Word became flesh, it is described to lye a little desolate Citie, and as yet re∣taineth
the name, without any memory of circuit by wals.



Of this Citie, in the yeare of 
Christ Iesus
 141. as the Monke of 
Barton
 doth report, nine Scholars
receiued their 
Baptisme,
 and became Preachers of the Gospell among the 
Britaines;
 which (as he
saith)
happened in the Raigne of 
Hadriant
 the Emperour. But when the 
, 
Stors, His
nes
 and 
Sax∣ons

had laid all things waste, and with their sauage swords cut out the leaues of all ciuill learning,
this as the rest yeelded to destruction, and so lay forlorne till the 
Saxons
 themselues became likewise
ciuill; when 
S
gebert
 the first 
Christian King
 of the 
East-Angles,
 from the example of 
France,
 whither
he had beene banished, built 
Schooies
 in his Kingdome, and here at 
Grancester
 the chiefe, recalling
thither the Professors of 
Arts
 and 
Sciences,
 as the Story recordeth, and Traditions doe hold.


But afterwards, as it seemeth, their increase being straightned, the 
Students
 complained (as the
Prophets did to 
Elisha)
 that the place was too little for them to dwell in, therefore inlarging more
North-ward, seated themselues neere vnto the 
Bridge,
 whereupon the place began to be called 
Grant∣bridge,

though others from the crooked Riuer 
Came
 will haue it named 
Cambridge.
 This place
(though sacred and exempted from 
Mars,
 as 
Sylla
 once spake; when he spared 
Athens,)
 the 
Danes

in their destructions regarded no whit, wherein they often wintered after their spoyles, and left the
scatres of their sauage sores euer behinde them. And in the yeare 1010 when 
Suen
 in his fiercenesse
bare downe all before him, this place was no place for 
Scholars
 to be in: 
Warres
 loud 
Alarums
 ill
consorting the 
Muses
 milde Harmonies. Yet when the 
Normans
 had got the 
Garland
 on their heads,
and these 
Danish stormes
 turned into 
Sun-shine dayes, Gislebert
 the 
Monke,
 with 
Odo, Terricus,
 and 
Wil∣liam,

all three of the like 
Monasticall Profession,
 in the Raigne of King 
Henry
 the First, resorted vnto
this place, and in a publike 
Barne
 read the 
Lectures
 of 
Grammar, Logicke,
 and 
Rhetoricke,
 and 
Gislebert
Diuinitie
 vpon the Sabbath and Festiuall dayes. 
From this little fountaine
 (saith 
Peter Blessensis) grew
a great Riuer, which made all
 England 
fruitfull, by the many Masters & Teachers proceeding out of
 Cam∣bridge,

as out of a holy Paradise of God.
 The first 
Colledge
 therein endowed with Possessions was 
Peter∣house,



built by 
Hugh Balsham
 Bishop of 
Ely,
 in the yeare of Grace, 1284. whose godly example many
others followed, so that at this day there are sixteene most stately 
Colledges
 and 
Hals,
 for building,
beautie, endowments, and store of 
Students
 so replenished, that vnlesse it be in her other Sister 
Ox∣ford,

the like are not found in all 
Europe.


But at what time it was made an 
Vniuersitie,
 let 
Robert de Remyngton
 tell you for me. 
Do the Raigne

(saith he) 
of King
 Edward 
the first, Grantbridge, of a Schoole, by the Court of Rome, was made an Vni∣uersitie,
such as Oxford is.
 Lastly, the 
Meridian Line
 cutting the 
Zenith
 ouer this Citie, is distant from
the furthest West-poynt, according to 
Mercator,
 20 degrees, 50 scruples, and the 
Arch
 of the same

Meridian,
 lying betweene the 
Aequator
 and 
Verticall point,
 is 52. degrees, 20 scruples.


(5) Another Citie formerly in great fame is 
Elie,
 had in account for the repute and holinesse of

Votary Nunnes
 there residing; built first by 
Audrey
 wife to one 
Tombret
 a 
Prince
 in this 
Prouince,

who had this place as a part of her Dowry: she hauing departed from her second Husband 
Egbert

King of 
Northumberland
 deuoted her selfe to the seruice of God, and built here a 
Monastery,
 where∣of
she became the first 
Abbesse.
 This in the 
Danish
 desolations was destroyed, but soone after reedi∣fied
by 
Ethelwold
 Bishop of 
Winchester,
 who stored it with 
Monkes;
 vnto whom King 
Edgar
 granted
the iurisdiction ouer foure Hundreds and a halfe, within these Fennes and the 
East-Angles
 limits,
which to this day are called 
The Liberties of S. Audrey,
 after whose example many 
Nobles
 so enriched
it with large 
Renexewes,
 that as 
Malmesbury
 saith, 
the Abbat thereof laid vp yeerely in his owne Coffers
a thousand and foure hundred pounds
 And of latter times the 
Monkes
 thereof became so wealthy, that
their old decayed Church they renued with new and most stately buildings, which is now the 
Ca∣thedrall

of the 
Diocesse,
 and for beautie giueth place to no other in the Land Eight other foundations
set apart from secular vse in this 
Prouince,
 were at 
Thorney, Charteres, Denny, Elsey, Beach, Barnwell,
Swasey,
 and 
Shengey,
 all which in the dayes of King 
Henry
 the eight came to the period of their sur∣passing
wealth, and left their Lands to the dispose of his Will.



(6) The generall commoditie of this Shire is 
Corne,
 which in the South, and Champion-part
doth abundantly grow, as also 
Saffron,
 a very rich Spice. Some 
Woods
 there are, and 
Pasture
 both
pleasant and profitable. The North part thereof is Fenny, but withall fruitfull, whereof 
Henry
 of

Huntington
 and 
William
 of 
Malinesbury
 thus doe write: 
This Fenny Country is passing rich and plente∣ous,
yea, and beautifull also to behold, whereiwis so great store of fish, that strangers doe wonder, and water-fowle
so cheape, that fiue men may therewith be satisfied with lesse then an halfe-penny.


(7) Places of ancient note in this Shire are these, the 
Erminstreet way,
 which vpon the lower
West parts of this County, thorow 
Roisen,
 runneth forthright vnto 
Huntingdon.
 And from 
Reach
 a
Market-Towne standing neere to the Riuer 
Came,
 a great 
Ditch
 and 
Trench
 is cast all along 
New∣market-Heath,

which for the wonder receiued thereat, is of the vulgar called 
The Deu
 Ditch,
 being
in truth made for a defence against the 
Mercians
 by the 
East-Angles,
 whose Kingdome it inuerged.
The 
Gogmagog Hils
 neere 
Cambridge
 retaine the remembrance of the 
Danish Siaetion,
 where as yet on
their tops is seene a 
Rampior,
 strengthened with a three-fold 
Trench,
 whereof 
Goruase
 of 
Tillury

tels vs many a pretio Tale.


(8) This 
Shire
 is diuided into seuenteene 
Hundreds,
 wherein are seated eight 
Market-Townes,

and hath beene strengthended with seauen 
Castles,
 and God diuinely honoured in one hundred sixtie
three 
Parish-Churches.














HERTFORD-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XIX.


HERTFORD-SHIRE is bordered vpon the 
North
 with 
Bedford
 and 
Cambridge-shires;
 vpon
the 
East,
 is altogether bounded by 
Essex;
 vpon the 
South,
 is confined with 
Middlesex;
 and her

West
 butteth vpon 
Buckingham
 and 
Bedford-shires.


(2) The forme thereof is somwhat circular, with many indents to fetch in those Townes
that are dispersedly stragled into her next 
Shire:
 whereof 
Roiston
 and 
Totteridge
 are the two
extreames from 
North
 to 
South,
 betwixt whom in a strait drawne line are twenty seuen 
English miles,

and from 
Putnam
 Westward, to 
Cheston Nunnery
 in the 
East,
 are twenty eight; the whole circum∣ference,
about an hundred and thirtie miles.


(3) The ayre is temperate, sweet, and healthfull, as seated in a Climate neither too hot, nor too
cold: the soile is rich, plenteous, and delightfull, yeelding abundance of 
Corne, Cattle, Wood,
 and

Grasse,
 destitute of nothing that ministreth profit or pleasures for life, which are more augmented by
the many 
Riuers
 that arise and run thorow this 
Shire,
 watering her owne and others, till they emp∣tie
themselues into the Sea.


(4) Her ancient Inhabitants in the time of the 
Romans
 were the 
Cattieuchlanians,
 or 
Cassijans,
 and
the 
Trinobantes,
 as their Writers declare, and in the 
Heptar
hy
 was possessed by the 
East-Saxons,
 ex∣cepting
some small portion thereof, that the 
Mercian
 Kings enioyned. The 
Danes
 also in their ouer∣runnings,
sought to stay themselues in this 
Shire,
 and at 
Ware
 (then 
Weare)
 pitched downe their
rest and hope: for passing the 
Lea
 in their light 
Pinnaces
 and 
Shallops,
 raised therein a 
Fort,
 which
maugre the 
English
 they kept, vntill that by the wise police of King 
Elfred,
 that 
Riuer
 was parted in∣to


to more running streames, whereby their 
Ships
 perished, and they intercepted both of prouision and
farther supply.


(5) The 
Romans
 before them had made 
Verolaxium
 in this Shire their greatest for account, which
in 
Neroes
 time was a 
Municipiall,
 as 
Nimus
 in his 
Catalogue
 of 
Cities
 doth call it, or as 
Tacitus,
 a 
Free
Towne;
 sacked by 
Boduo
 that euer eternized 
Queene
 of the 
Ictanians,
 when seuenty thousand of the

Romans
 and 
Consecrates
 by her reuenging sword perished: the site and circuit whereof, in this 
Card

we haue set according to our view and measure there taken: whose magnificence for 
Port
 and stately

Architecture,
 were found by her large and arched 
Vaults
 in the dayes of King 
Edgar,
 which were
digged into and cast downe by 
 and 
, 
Abbots
 of S. 
Albanes,
 for that they were the recep∣tacles
and lurking holes of 
 and 
: the ruines of which, haue raised the beautie of her
suruiuing and faire S. 
Albanes,
 where 
 the great 
Mercian,
 in great deuotion, built a most stately

 whose Church yet standing, retaineth the ashes of many 
Nobles,
 there slaine in the quar∣rell
of 
Yorke
 and 
Lancaster;
 and a 
Font
 of solid brasse brought out of 
Scotland
 by Sir 
Richara Lea,

from the siege of 
L
eth


(6) Many other Townes, both for Commerce, stately Buildings, and of ancient Record, this
Shire affordeth, whereof 
Hertford,
 though the 
Shire-Towne,
 is not the richest; the passage thorow

Ware
 hath left her wayes so vntrodden: to preuent which, in former times that 
Riuer
 at 
Ware
 was
chained vp, and the 
Bayliffe
 of 
Hertford
 had the custody of the 
Key:
 which howsoeuer they haue lost,
yet hath the 
Towne
 gotten her 
Gouernour
 to be preferred from the name of a 
Bilisse,
 vnto a 
Maior,

assisted with nine 
Burg
sses,
 a 
Recorder,
 and two 
Sergeants
 their 
Attendants.
 Herein a 
Castle,
 for situa∣tion
pleasant, for 
Trench, Walles,
 and 
Riuer,
 sufficiently fenced, was lately seene; but marked to de∣stinie,
as the 
Towne
 to decay, hath found the hand of 
Fortune
 to ouermatch her strength, and to rui∣nate
the 
Priory,
 S. 
Nicholas,
 and S. 
Maries Churches,
 besides a 
Cell
 of S. 
Albanes Monkes,
 that therein


were seated. The like fate fals vnto 
Hemsled,
 and her faire 
Castle,
 wherein 
Richard
 King of the 
Ro∣mans

left his life Yet 
Lingely
 is graced both in the birth of Prince 
Edmund
 the fifth sonne to King

Edward
 the third, and the buriall of 
Richard
 the second that vnfortunate King, who in the 
Cell
 of

Fryers Preachers
 was there first buried, but afterwards remooued and enshrined at 
Westminster.
 And
in another 
Langley,
 neere the 
East
 from thence, was borne that 
Pontificall Break-speare, Bishop
 of

Rome,
 knowne by the name of 
Hadrian
 the fourth, (and famous for his stirrup-holding by 
Fredericke

the 
Emperour)
 whose breath was lastly stopped by a 
Flie
 that flew into his mouth.


(7) The ciuill 
Battles
 that in this Shire haue beene sought, in the 
Map
 it selfe are inserted, and
therefore here omitted, but the more ancient remembred vnto vs by 
Osister-hill
 neere S. 
Albans,

whom the judicious 
Combden
 supposeth to haue beene the 
Campe
 of 
Ostorius
 the second 
Lieutenant,

and 
Subdue
 of great 
Caractatus;
 as also seuen small round 
Hils
 betwixt 
Sieuennedge
 and 
Ku
worth,

in which are supposed some 
Romane Souldiers
 to lie buried.


(8) Religious Houses built and suppressed, the chiefest for account in this 
Shire,
 were S. 
Albans,
Ro
ston, Ware, Sopwell, Langeley,
 besides them at 
Hertford,
 whom 
Beda
 cals 
Horudford:
 which 
Cities
 gra∣duation
is distant and remoued from the 
Equator 52. degrees 5. minutes
 of 
Latitude,
 and set from the
first point of the 
West,
 according to 
Mercator,
 in the 
20 degree 29. minutes
 of 
Longitude.
 The 
∣domes

whereof, were enioyed onely by tho
 two honourable 
 whose atchieuements we haue
also therein expressed.


(9) This 
Counties
 diuision is into eight 
Hundreds,
 wherein are seared eighteene 
Market-Townes,

and one hundred and twentie 
Parish-Churches.














BEDFORD-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XX.


BEDFORD-SHIRE, seated in the South-East of this 
Iland,
 is a plaine and champion Coun∣try,
and lyeth bounded vpon the North with 
Huntington-shire;
 vpon the East with 
Cambridge

and 
Hartford-shires;
 vpon the South with 
Hartford
 and 
Buckingham-shires;
 and vpon the West
with 
Buckingham
 and 
Northampton-shires.


(2) The forme thereof is somwhat ouall, and not very large: for from 
Tilbroke
 in the North,
vnto 
Stu
am
 in the South, are but twentie-foure English miles; and from 
Turny
 in the West, vnto

Hatley Coking
 in the East, are not fully foureteene; the whole in Circumference, about seauenty three
miles.


(3) The Ayre is temperate, and the Soile bounteous, especially the North, whose Borders the
fruitfull 
Ouse
 with her many windings watereth. The South is more leane, and with greater indu∣stry
bringeth forth 
Barley,
 no better else-where. Generally, this County is Champion, though some
places be sprinkled with Pasturage and Woods.


(4) The ancient Inhabitants knowne to the 
Romanes,
 that held in this Shire, were part of the

Cattieuchlani,
 a stout and warre-strring people: and yet vpon the report of 
Caesars
 proceeding, sent
him their subiection for peace. But when that conquering Nation had brought 
Britaine
 into a 
Pro∣uince

vnder 
Rome,
 their Legions lay at 
Selenae
 and 
Magintum,
 which are now 
Sandy
 and 
Dunstable,

places of memorable note in this Shire. After them the 
Saxons
 coueting for so faire a Seate, first dis∣possessed
the 
Britaines,
 vnder the leading of 
Cuthwulfe
 the 
West-Saxon,
 about the yeare of Grace 572.
who making it their owne, was lastly enioyed by the 
Mercians,
 as a part of their Kingdome.



(5) In the yeare of Christs Incarnation 1399 immediately before those 
Ciuill Warres,
 that rent
in pieces the peace of this Land, betweene the Princes of 
Lancaster
 and 
Yorke,
 the Riuer 
Ouse
 neere
vnto 
Harwood,
 stood sodainly still, and refrained to passe any farther; so that forward, men passed
three miles together on foot in the very depth of her Channell; and backward, the waters swelled
vnto a great height: which was obserued by the judicious, to foretell some vnkinde diuision that
shortly should arise.


(6) This Countie, among the common calamities of the Land, when it lay trampied vnder the
fect of the 
Danes,
 sustained a part: and after that, in the time of King 
Stephen,
 when the 
Ciuill Warres

thundred betwixt 
Maud
 the 
Empresse
 and himselfe, the Shire-Towne was sore wasted, with great
slaughter of men: So when the 
Barons
 forsooke their allegeance to King 
Iohn,
 the Towne and Ca∣stle
were rendred vp vnto their hands: and lastly, by King 
Henry
 the third, laid leuell euen with the
ground, some ruinous walles appearing towards the 
Ouse,
 but not a stone left vpon the 
Mount
 where
stood his foundation.


(7) This Towne by the 
Britaines
 was called 
Lettidur;
 and of vs, 
Bedford:
 being the chiefest in
the Countie, from whom it taketh the name, and is most fruitfull, and pleasantly seated, hauing the

Ouse
 running thorow the Towne in the middest, and a faire 
Stone-bridge
 built ouer the same, where∣on
are two Gates to locke and impeach the passage, as occasion shall serue. At the first entrance
standeth S. 
Leonards Hospitall
 for 
Lazars:
 and further inwards, S. 
Iohns
 and S. 
Maries
 Churches:
within the Towne, S. 
Pauls,
 a most beautifull Church, S. 
Cuthberis,
 and S. 
Peters:
 without the
Towne standeth the 
Fryers,
 S. 
Loyes, Alhallowes,
 and 
Caudwell Abbey:
 not farre whence sometimes
stood a Chappell vpon the Banke of 
Ouse,
 wherein (as 
Florilegus
 affirmeth) the body of 
Offa
 the
great 
Mercian
 King was interred, but by the ouer-swelling of that Riuer, was borne downe, and
swallowed vp; whose Tombe of Lead (as it were some phantasticall thing) appeared often to them


that seeke it not, but to them that seeke it (saith 
Rosse)
 it is inuisible. This Towne is gouerned
yearely by a 
Mator,
 two 
Bailiffes,
 two 
Chamberlaines,
 a 
Recorder,
 a 
towne-Clerke,
 and three 
Sergeants

with 
Mases.


(8) A tale of vaine credit is reported of 
Dunstable,
 that it was built to bridle the outragiousnesse
of a theefe named 
Dun,
 by King 
Henry
 the first: but certaine it is the place was formerly held by the

Romanes,
 whose 
Legions
 there lay, as appeareth by the Coines there vsually found, which from 
Ma∣gmium

are corruptly called 
Madning-money.


(9) Castles in this Shire are 
Woodhill, Eaton, Temsford,
 and 
Amphill,
 an honour now appertaining
to the Crowne. And places of 
Religion,
 built by deuout persons, but for 
Idolatrous Abuses
 againe a∣bolished,
were at 
Bedford, Harwood, Helenflow, Newenham, Chicksand, Wardon, Woborne,
 and 
Dunstable.

All these, with their like, felt the hand of 
Henry
 the Eight to lie so heauie vpon them, that they were
not able to sustaine the waight, but were crushed to peices, and fell to the ground.


(10) The Graduation of this Countie, taken for the Shire-Towne, is placed from the 
Equa∣tor

in the degree of 52. and 30. minutes for Latitude, and is remoued from the first West point of
Longitude, 20. degrees and 16. minutes.


(11) Whose Princely Families that haue borne the Titles both of 
Dukes
 and 
Earles,
 are expres∣sed;
and whose Counties diuision are into nine 
Hundreds,
 wherein are seated ten Market-Townes,
and one hundred and sixteene Parish-Churches.













BVCKINGHAM-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXI.


BVCKINGHAM, for the plentie of 
Beech-trees
 there growing, and those in the elder times of
the 
Saxons
 called 
Eucken,
 may well be supposed from them to haue the name, as afterwards
the whole Shire had hers from this Towne 
Buckingham.


(2) In forme it somewhat resembleth a Lyon Rampant, whose head or North-point tou∣cheth
the Counties of 
Northampton
 and 
Bedford;
 whose backe or East-part is backed by 
Bedford

and 
Hertford-shires:
 his loines or South-borders rest vpon 
Bark shire,
 and his breast the West side is
butted vpon wholly by 
Oxford-shire
 The length thereof from 
Waisbury
 in the South, to 
Bradfeild
 in
her North, are thirtie nine miles: the breadth at the broadest, from 
Ashridge
 in the East, to 
-wood
Forrest
 in the West, are eighteene; the whole in Circumference one hundred thirtie 

miles.


(3) The ayre is passing good, temperate, and pleasant, yeelding the body health, and the minde
content. The soile is rich, fat, and fruitfull, giuing abundance of Corne, Grasse and Meate. It is
chiefly diuided into two parts by the 
Chiltren billes,
 which run thorow this Shire in the middest, and
before tim
 where so postered with 
Be
h,
 that they were altogether vnpassable, and became a recep∣tacle
and refuge for theeues, who daily endammaged the way-faring man; for which cause 

Abbot of S. 
A
ba
s
 caused them to be cut downe: since when those parts are pa
able, without any
great incumbrances of trees; from whose tops, a large and most pleasing prospect is 
▪ The
Vale beneath is plaine and champion, a clayie soile, stiffe, and tough, but withall marueilous 

full naked of woods, but abounding in medowes, pastures, and tillage, and maintaining an infinite
number of sheepe, whose soft and fine fleeces are in great esteeme with the 
Turkes
 as farre as, 
Asia.



(4) The ancient Inhabitants that were seated in this Shire, were the 
Catlieuchlani,
 mentioned
by 
Ptolemie,
 and them dispersed thorow the Tract of 
Bedford, Hertford,
 and this. These yeelded
themselues with the first to 
Caesar
 vnder the 
Romanes
 subiection, whose ouer-worne Empire ending
in 
Britaine,
 the 
Saxons
 by strong hand attained this Prouince, and made it a part of their 
Mercian
Kingdome:
 yet was it first subdued vnto them by 
Cherdike
 the 
West-Saxon,
 whose memory is in part
continued in the Towne 
Chersey,
 vpon the West of this Countie, where in a sharpe and bloudy bat∣tle
he was Victor ouer the 
Britaines.
 So also 
Cuthwulfe
 a 
West-Saxon
 at 
Alesbury
 in the yeare of
Grace 592. ouer came the 
Britaines,
 and bare downe all things before him: yet no sooner was their

Hep
archie
 wained, and their 
Monarchie
 able to stand alone, but that the 
Danes,
 before their strength
and growth was confirmed, waxed vpon them; and they not able in so weake a hand to hold fast
that weight of greatnesse they had so grasped, gaue place to their conquerours, who did many harmes
in this Prouince: for in the yeare 914. the 
Danes
 furiously raged as farre as 
Brenwood,
 where they
destroyed the City 
Burgh,
 the ancient seat of the 
Romanes,
 afterwards a royall house of King 
Edward

the 
Confessor,
 which they vtterly destroyed.


(5) The Shire-Towne 
Buckingham,
 fruitfully seated vpon the Riuer 
Ouse,
 was fortified with a
Rampire, and Sconses on both bankes, by King 
Edward
 the elder, saith 
Marianus
 the Scotish Wri∣ter;
where in the heart of the Towne hath stood a strong Castle, mounted vpon a high hill, which
long since was brought to the period of her estate, now nothing remaining besides the signes, that
there she had stood. The Riuer circulates this Towne on euery side, that onely on the North ex∣cepted,
ouer which three faire stone-bridges lead, and into which the springs of a Well run, called
S. 
Rumalds,
 a child-saint borne at 
Kings-Sutton,
 canonized, and in the Church of this Towne en∣shrined,
with many conceited miracles and cures: such was the happe of those times, to produce
Saints of all ages and sexes. This Towne is gouerned by a Bayliffe and twelue principall Burgesses;


and is in the degree remoued from the first point of the West for Longitude 19. 33. scruples, and
the North-pole elenated in Latitude for the degree of 52. 18. scruples.


(6) A Towne of ancient note is 
Stony-Stratford,
 the 
Romans Lactorodum,
 being built vpon that
ancient 
Causey-way
 which is called 
Watling-street,
 where remaine the markes thereof euen vnto this
day At this place 
Edward
 the elder stopped the passage of the 
Danes,
 whiles he strengthened 
Tor∣cester

against them: and herein, King 
Edward
 the eldest since the Conquest, reared a beautifull Crosse
in memory of 
Eleanor
 his dead Queene, as he did in euery place where her Corps rested, from 
Herd∣by

in 
Lincolne-shire,
 till it was receiued and buried at 
Westminster.


(7) Places intended for Gods true worship, built by deuout persons, and sequestred from
worldly imployments, were at 
Launden, Luffeld, Bidlesden, Bradwell, Nothey, Ankerne, Missenden, Teke∣ford,
Partrendune, Ashridge,
 and 
Alesburie: Ashridge
 in great repute for the bloud (supposed out of
Christs sides) brought out of 
Germany
 by 
Henry
 the eldest sonne of 
Richard
 King of the 
Romanes,

and Earle of 
Cornwall,
 whereunto resorted great concourse of people for deuotion, and adoration
thereof. But when the Sunne-shine of the Gospell had pierced thorow such clouds of darkenesse,
it was perceiued apparantly to be onely hony clarified and coloured with Saffron, as was openly
shewed at 
Pauls Crosse
 by the Bishop of 
Rochester,
 the twentie-fourth of 
Februarie,
 and yeare of
Christ 1538. And 
Alesbury
 for the holinesse of S. 
Edith,
 was much frequented, who hauing this
Towne allotted for her Dowrie, bad the world and her husband fa
ewell, in taking vpon her the
veile of deuotion, and in that fruitfull age of Saints became greatly renowned, euen as farre as to
the working of miracles. These all in the stormes and rage of the time, suffred such shipwracke, that
from those turmoiled Seas, their merchandise light in the right of such Lords as made them their
owne for wreacks indeed.



(8) With foure Castles this Shire hath beene strengthned, and thorow eleuen Market-Townes
her Commodities traded; being diuided, for seruice to the Crowne and State, into eight Hun∣dreds,
and in them are seated one hundred fourescore and fiue Parish-Churches.













OXFORD-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXI.


OXFORD-SHIRE receiueth her name from that famous 
Vniuersitie
 and most beautifull
Citie 
Oxford,
 and this of the 
Foord
 of 
Oxen,
 say our 
English-Saxons;
 though 
Leiland
 vpon a
ground of coniecture will haue it 
Ousford,
 from the Riuer 
Ouse
 (by the 
Latines
 called 
Isis)

which giueth name likewise to the adioyning 
Iland Ousney.
 The North point of this Shire
is bordered vpon by the Counties of 
Warwicke
 and 
Northampton,
 the East with 
Bucking∣ham,

the West by 
Glocester-shire,
 and the South altogether is parted from 
Bark-shire
 by 
Thamisis, the
Prince of British Riuers.


(2) The blessings both of the sweet-breathing heauens, and the fruitfull site of this Counties
soile, are so happie and fortunate, that hardly can besaid whether exceeds. The aire milde, tempe∣rate
and delicate; the Land fertile, pleasant, and bounteous; in a word, both 
Heauen
 and 
Earth
 ac∣corded
to make the Inhabitants healthfull and happie: The hils loaden with woods and Cattle, the
vallies burthened with Corne and Pasturage, by reason of many fresh springing Riuers which spor∣tingly
there-thorow make their passage, whereof 
England, Char
ll, 
 and 
Isis
 are chiefe: which
two last making their Bed of Marriage 
 together in one channell
and name.


(3) The length of this Shire is from 
Cleydon
 in the North-west, vnto 
 in her South-East,
neere vnto 
Thamisis,
 and amounteth almost to fortie miles; the broadest part is in her westerne
Borders, which extending from the said 
Cleydon
 in the North, vnto 
Faring
 
 the Riuer

Isis
 in the South, are scarcely twentie sixe: and thence growing narrower 

in Circumference about one hundred and thirtie miles.



(4) The ancient Inhabitants knowne to the 
Romans,
 were the 
Dobuni,
 part whereof possessed
further Westernly into 
Glocester-shire,
 and nearer Eastward, betwixt the bowing of 
Thamises,
 were
seated the 
Ancalites,
 who sent their submission vnto 
Iulius Caesar,
 when report was made that the 
Trino∣bantes

had put themselues vnder his protection; whereof followed the 
Britaines
 seruitude vnder the
proud yoke of the all-coueting 
Romans:
 yet afterwards this Counties people, being very puissant
(as 
Tacitus
 termes them) and vnshaken by warres, withstood 
Ostorius Scapula
 the 
Roman
 Lieutenant,
choosing rather to yeeld their liues in battle, then their persons to subiection. Of latter times it was
possessed by the 
Mercian Saxons,
 as part of their Kingdome, though sometimes both the 
West-Sax∣ons

and the 
Northumbrians
 had the dispose of some part thereof: for 
Beda
 affirmeth that K. 
Oswold

gaue the then-flourishing Citie 
D
rchester
 vnto 
Berinus
 the 
West-Saxons
 Apostle, to be his Episcopall
See: whence the good Bishop comming to 
Oxford,
 and preaching before 
Wulpherus
 the 
Mercian

King (in whose Court 
Athelwold
 the 
South-Saxons
 heathenish King was then present) he with all
his Nobles were conuerted to the faith of Christ, and there baptized, whereby 
Berinus
 became the
Apostle also of the 
South Saxons.


(5) Otherplaces of memorable note either for actions therein happening, or for their owne
famous esteeme, are the 
R
ll-rich-stones,
 standing neere vnto 
Enisham
 in the South of this Shire: a
monument of huge stones, set round in compasse, in manner of the 
Stonch
nge:
 of which, fabulous
tradition hath reported forsooth, that they were metamorphised from men, but in truth were there
erected vpon some great victory obtained, either by, or against 
Rollo
 the 
Dane,
 who in the yeare 876.
entred 
England,
 and in this Shire fought two Battles, one neere vnto 
Hoch-Norton,
 and a second at
the 
Scier-Stane.


(6) 
Rod
os
 likewise remaineth as a monument of 
Oxfords
 high-stiled Barle, but vnfortunate
Prince, 
Robert de Vere,
 who besides the Earledome, was created by King 
Richard
 the second, 
Mar∣quesse



of 
Dublin,
 and 
Duke
 of 
Ireland:
 but at that Bridge, discomfited in fight by the Nobles, and for∣ced
to swimme the Riuer, where began the downefall of his high mounted fortunes; forbeing dri∣uen
forth of his Country, lastly died in exile and distressed estate. But more happie is this Countie
in producing farre more glorious Princes, as King 
Edward
 the 
Confessor,
 who in 
Islip
 was borne; 
Ed∣ward

the victorious blacke Prince, in 
Woodstocke;
 and in 
Oxford
 that warlike 
Coeur de Lion,
 King 
Ri∣chard

the first, the sonne of King 
Henry
 the second, first tooke breath.


(7) Which Citie is, and long hath beene the glorious seat of the 
Muses,
 the British 
Athens,
 and
learnings well-spring, from whose buing fountaine the wholesome waters of all good literature
streaming plenteously, haue made fruitfull all other parts of this Realme, and gained glory amongst
all Nations abroad. Antiquitie auoucheth, that this place was consecrated vnto the sacred Scien∣ces
in the time of the old 
Britaines,
 and that from 
Greeke-lad,
 a Towne in 
Wilt-shire,
 the Academie
was translated vnto 
Oxford,
 as vnto a Plant-plot, both more pleasing and fruitfull: whereto accor∣deth
the ancient 
Burlaus
 and 
Necham,
 this latter also alledging 
Merlin.
 But when the beautie of the
Land lay vnder the 
Saxons
 prophane feete, it sustained a part of those common calamities, hauing
little reserued to vphold its former glory, saue onely the famous monument of S. 
Frideswids Virgin
Conquest,
 no other Schoole then left standing besides her Monasterie: yet those great blasts, toge∣ther
with other 
Danish
 stormes, being well blowne ouer, King 
Elfred,
 that learned and religious Mo∣narch,
recalled the exiled 
Muses
 to their sacred place, and built there three goodly 
Colledges
 for the
studies of Diuinitie, Philosophie, and other Arts of humanitie, sending thither his owne sonne 
E∣thelward,

and drew thither the yong Nobles from all parts of his Kingdome. The first reader there∣of
was his supposed brother 
Neote,
 a man of great learning, by whose direction King 
Elfred
 was alto∣gether
guided in this his goodly foundation. At which time also, 
Asserius Meneuensis,
 a writer of
those times affaires, read the 
Grammar
 and 
Rhetoricke,
 and affirmeth that long before them, 
G
das,


Melkin, Ninius, Kentigern,
 S. 
German,
 and others, spent there their liues in learned studies. From
which time that it continued a 
Seed plot
 of learning till the 
Norman
 Conquest, 
ugul
us
 recordeth,
who himselfe then liued. No maruell then if 
Matthew Paris
 calleth 
Oxford,
 the second Schoole of
Christendome, and the very chiefe Pillar of the Catholike Church And in the Councell holden at

Vienna,
 it was ordained, that in 
Paris, Oxford, Bononia,
 and 
Salamanca
 (the onely 
Vniuersities
 then in

Europe)
 should be erected Schooles for the 
Hebrew, Greeke, Arabicke,
 and 
Chaldean
 tongues, and that

Oxford
 should be the generall Vniuersitie for all 
England, Ireland, Scotland,
 and 
Wales:
 which point
was likewise of such weight with the 
Councell
 of 
Constance,
 that from this precedent of 
Oxford
 Vni∣uersitie,
it was concluded, that the 
English
 Nation was not onely to haue precedence of 
Spaine
 in all
Generall Councels, but was also to be held equall with 
France
 it selfe. By which high prerogatiues
this of ours hath alwayes so flourished, that in the dayes of King 
Henry
 the 
 thirtie thousand
Students were therein resident, as Archbishop 
Armachanus
 (who then liued) 
 writ, and 
∣ger

(then also liuing) sheweth, that for all the ciuill warres which hindered such 
 of quiet stu∣die,
yet 15000. Students were there remaining, whose names (saith he) were 
 in 
matricula,

in the 
matriculation booke.
 About which time. 
Iohn Baltol
 (the father of 
Baltol
 King of 
Scots)
 built a
Colledge, yet bearing his name, 
Anno
 1269. and 
Walter Merton
 Bishop of 
Rochester,
 that which is
now called 
Merton Colledge;
 both of them beautified with buildings, and enriched with lands, and
were the first endowed 
Colledges
 for learning in all Christendome. And at this present 
 six∣teene

Colledges
 (besides another newly builded) with eight Hals, and many most 

Churches, all adorned with most stately buildings, and enriched with great endowments, noble
Libraries, and most learned Graduates of all professions, that vnlesse it be her sister 
Cambridge,
 the
other nursing breast of this Land, the like is not sound againe in the world. This Citie is also ho∣noured
with an 
Episcopall See.
 As for the site thereof, it is remoued from the Equator in the degree


52. and one minute, and from the West by 
Mercators
 measure, 19. degrees, and 
0. minutes.


(8) As this Countie is happie in the possession of so famous an 
Academie,
 so is it graced with
most Princely Palaces appertaining to the 
English Crowne,
 whereof 
Woodstocke
 is the most ancient
and magnificent, built to that glory by King 
Henry
 the first, and enlarged with a Labyrinth of ma∣ny
windings by King 
Henry
 the second, to hide from his jealous 
Iuno,
 his intirely beloued Concu∣bine

Rosamond Clifford,
 a Damosell of surpassing beautie; where notwithstanding, followed by a
clew of silke that fell from her lap, she was surprised and poisoned by Queene 
Eleanor
 his wife, and
was first buried at 
Godstow Nunnery,
 in the midst of the Quire vnder a Hearse of silke, set about with
lights, whom 
Hugh
 Bishop of 
Lincolne
 (thinking it an vnfit obiect for Virgins deuotion) caused to
be remoued into the Church yard: but those chaste sisters liked so well the memory of that kinde
Lady, as that her bones they translated againe into their Chappell.


Bensington
 is another of his Majesties Mannours, built by 
William de la Pole
 Duke of 
Suffolke,
 but
now in neglect through the anno
ance arising from the waters or marishes adioyning Houses built
for deuotion, and for abuse suppressed and againe put downe, the chiefe in account were 
Enisham,
Osney, Bru
rn, Godstow, Burchester,
 and 
Tame,
 besides S. 
Frideswides,
 and very many other stately
Houses of Religion in the Citie.


The Diuision of this Shire is into fourteene Hundreds, wherein are seated ten Market-Townes,
and two hundred and fourescore Parish-Churches.













GLOCESTER-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXIII.


GLOCESTER-SHIRE, lyeth bordered vpon the North with 
Worcester
 and 
Warwicke-shires,

vpon the East with 
Oxford
 and 
Wileshire;
 vpon the South altogether with 
Sommerset-shire:

and vpon the West with the Riuer 
Wye
 and 
Hereford-shire.


(2) The length thereof extended from 
Bristow
 vpon the Riuer 
Auon
 in her South, vnto

Clifford
 vpon another 
Auon
 in her North, are about fortie eight miles; and her broadest part
from East to West, is from 
Lechlad
 vnto 
Preston,
 containing twentie eight: the whole circumference
about one hundred thirtie eight miles.


(3) 
The forme whereof is somewhat long and narrow: the Ayre thereof is pleasant, sweet and
delectable: and for fruitfulnesse of Soile heare
 Malmesbury 
and not me:
 The ground of this Shire
throughout 
(saith he)
 yeeldeth plentie of Corne, and bringeth forth abundance of fruits; the one through
the naturall goodnesse onely of the ground, the other through the diligent manuring and tillage, in such wise,
that it would prouoke the laziest person to take paines Here you may see the High-wayes and Common Lanes
clad with Apple trees and Peare trees, not ingrafted by the industry of mans hand, but growing naturally of
their owne accord: the ground of it selfe is so inclined to beare fruits, and those both in taste and beautie farre
exceeding others, and will endure vntill a new supply come. There is not any Country in 
England
 so thicke
set with Vineyards as this Prouince is, so plentifull of increase, and so pleasant in taste. The very wines made
thereof carry no vnpleasant tartnesse, as being little inferiour in sweet verdure to the French wines; the hou∣ses
are innumerable, the Churches passing faire, and the Townes standing very thicke. But that which ad∣deth
vnto all good gifts (a speciall glory) is the Riuer 
Seuerne,
 then which there is not any in all the Land, for


Channell broader, for Streame swifter, or for Fish better stored. There is in it a daily rage and fury of wa∣ters,
which I know not whether I may call a Gulfe or Whirle-pole of waues, raising vp the sands from the
bottome, winding and driuing them vpon heapes: sometimes ouerflowing her bankes, ro
eth a great way
vpon the face of her bordering grounds, and againe retyreth as a Conquerour into the vsuall Channell. Vn∣happy
is the Vessell which it taketh full vpon the side: but the Water-men well ware thereof, when they see
that Hydra comming, turne the Vessell vpon it, and cut thorow the midst of it, whereby they checke and a∣uoyd
her violence and danger.


(4) The ancient people that possessed this Prouince, were the DOBVNI, who spread them∣selues
further into 
Oxford shire.
 But betwixt the 
Seuerne
 and 
Wye
 were seated part of SILVRES,
or Inhabitants of 
South Wales.
 And vpon what ground I know not, let 
Lawyers
 dispute it, the In∣habitants
in some part of this Shire enioy a priuate custome to this day, that the Goods and Lands
of 
Condemned Persons
 fall vnto the Crowne but onely for a yeare and a day, and then returne to the
next heires, contrary to the custome of all 
England
 besides▪


(5) The general Commodities of this Shire, are 
Corne, Iron,
 and 
Wools,
 all passing fine, besides

Pasturage, Fruits,
 and 
Woods,
 which last are much lessened by making of 
Iron,
 the onely bane of 
Oke,
Elme,
 and 
Beech.


(6) These, with all other prouisions are traded thorow twenty fiue 
Market-Townes
 in this Coun∣ty,
whereof two are Cities of no small import: the first is 
Glocester,
 from whom the Shire taketh
name, seated vpon 
Seuerne,
 neere the middest of this Shire, by 
Antonine
 the Emperour called 
Gleu∣um,

built first by the 
Romans,
 and set as it were vpon the necke of the 
Silures,
 to yoake them, where
their Le
ion called 
Colonia Gleuum,
 lay. It hath beene walled about (excepting that part that is
defended by the Riuer) the ruines whereof in many places appeare; and some part yet standing,
doth well witnesse their strength. This City was first won from the 
Britaines
 by 
Cheulin
 the first King


of the 
West-Saxons,
 about the yeare of Christ, 570. and afterwards vnder the 
Mercians
 it flourished
with great honour, where 
Of
k
 King of 
Northumberland,
 by the sufferance of 
Ethelred
 of 
Mercia,

founded a most stately 
Monastery
 of 
Nunnes,
 whereof 
Kineburgh, Eadburgh,
 and 
Eue,
 Queenes of
the 
Mercians,
 were 
Prioresses
 successiuely each after other.


(7) 
Edelsted
 a most renowned Lady, sister to King 
Edward
 the elder, in this Citie built a faire
Church, wherein her selfe was interred; which being ouerthrowne by the 
Danes,
 was afterwards re∣built,
and made the Cathedrall of that See, dedicated vnto the honour of S. 
Peter.
 In this Church
the vnfortunate Prince, King 
Edward
 the second, vnder a Monument of 
Alablaster
 doth lye; who be∣ing
murdered at 
Barkley Castle,
 by the crueltie of 
French Isabel
 his wife, was there intombed And not
farre from him another Prince as vnfortunate, namely, 
Robert Curthole,
 the eldest sonne of 
William

the 
Conquerour,
 lyeth in a painted woodden 
Tombe
 in the middest of the 
Quire;
 whose eyes were
pluckt out in 
Cardiffe Castle,
 wherein he was kept prisoner twenty six yeares, with all contumelious
indignities, vntill through extreame anguish he ended his life. And before any of these, in this Citie
say our 
British Historians,
 the body of 
Lucius
 our first Christian King was interred: and before his
dayes the 
Britaines Aruiragus.


The graduation of this County I obserue from this Citie, whence the Pole is eleuated in the de∣gree
of Latitude 52 and 14. minutes, and in Longitude from the West, 18. and 5. minutes.


(8) The other Citie is 
Pristow,
 fa
re, but not very ancient, built vpon the Riuers 
Auon
 and

Froome,
 for trade of Merchandize a second 
London,
 and for beautie and account next vnto 
Yorke.

This Citie standeth partly in this Countie, and partly in 
Sommerset shire:
 but being a Countie of it
selfe, will acknowledge subiection to neither.


(9) A Citie more ancient hath beene 
Ci
cester,
 by 
Ptolomie
 called 
Corinium;
 by 
Antonine, Duro∣
no
ium;

by 
Giraldus, Passerum Vi
em,
 The Sparrowes Citie, vpon a flying report, that 
Gu
mund



a Tyrant from 
Africks,
 besieging this Citie, tyed fire vnto the wings of Sparrowes, who lighting in
the Towne vpon light matter, set flame vpon all. The circuit of whose wal
 extended two miles a∣bout,
wherein the Consular Port or wayes of the 
Romans
 met and crossed each other. This Citie was
wonne from the 
Britaines
 by 
Cheulin
 first King of the 
West-Saxons:
 afterwards it was possessed by
the 
Mercians;
 and lastly, by the 
Danes
 vnder 
Gurmund
 (the former no doubt mistaken for him) where∣in
a rable of them kept the space of a yeare, 
Anno
 879. and neuer since inhabited, according to the
circuit of her walles.


(10) Places of memorable note are these: the 
Iland Al
ey
 neere vnto 
Glocester,
 wherein 
Edmund
Iron-side
 the 
English,
 and 
Canutus
 the 
Dane,
 after many battles and bloud, fought in single Combat
hand to hand alone, vntill they compounded for the Kingdomes partition: 
Barkley Castle,
 where
King 
Edward
 the second was thorow his fundament runne into his bowels with a red burning Spit:

Tewkesbury
 the fatall period of King 
Henry
 the sixt his gouernment, and the wound of the 
Lanca∣strian

Cause; for in a Battle there fought in 
Anno
 1471. Prince 
Edward,
 the onely Sonne of King

Henry,
 had his braines dashed out in a most shamefull manner, the Queene his mother taken priso∣ner,
and most of their fauorites slaine and beheaded. And at 
Alderley,
 a little Towne standing eight
miles from the 
Seuerne,
 vpon the hilles to this day are found 
Cockles, Periwincles,
 and 
Oysters
 of solid
stone, which whether they haue beene Shel-fish and liuing creatures, or else the sports of 
Nature
 in
her workes, let the 
Naturall Philosophers
 dispute of and judge.


(11) The places of pietie, set apart from other worldly Seruices, and dedicated to religious v∣ses
by the deuotions of Princes, erected in this Shire, were 
Tewkesbury, Deorhust, Glocester, Minching,
Barkley, Kinswood, Circester, Winchcombe,
 and 
Hales;
 which last was built with great cost by 
Richard

Earle of 
Cornwall,
 King of the 
Romans,
 wherein himselfe, and his 
Dutchesse
 were interred. Their son
Earle 
Edmund
 brought out of 
Germany
 the bloud of 
Hales,
 supposed and said to be part of that which


Christ shed vpon his Crosse. In this place with great confluence and deuotions of Pilgrimage it
was sought to and worshipped, till time proued it a meere counterfeit, when the glorious light of the
Gospell reuealed to eye-sight such grosse Idolat
ies, and the skirts of Superstition were turned vp,
to the shew of her owne shame.


(12) Dukes and Earles that haue borne the title of 
Glocester,
 the first of euery 
Family
 art by their
Armes and Names expressed, euer fatall to her Dukes, though the greatest in bloud and birth.
The first was 
Thomas Woodstocke,
 sonne to King 
Edward
 the third, who in 
Ca
is
 was smoothered in a
Feather-bed to death. The second was 
Humfrey
 brother to King 
Henry
 the fift, by the fraudulent
practise of the malignant Cardinall and Queene, made away at S. 
Edmundsbury.
 And the last was

Richard,
 brother to King 
Edward
 the fourth, who by the iust hand of God was cut off in Battle by
King 
Henry
 the seauenth.


(13) This Shires diuision is principally into foure parts, subdiuided into thirtie Hundreds, and
them againe into two hundred and eight Parish-Churches.













HEREFORD-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXIIII.


HEREFORD-SHIRE, (formerly accounted within the limits of 
Wales)
 lyeth circulated
vpon the North with 
Worcester
 and 
Shrop-shire;
 vpon the East with 
Maluerne Hils
 is parted
from 
Glocester-shire;
 vpon the South is kept in with 
Monmouth-shire;
 and vpon the West in
part with the 
Hatterall Hilles
 is diuided from 
Brecknok;
 and the rest confined with 
Radnor∣shire.


(2) This Counties Climate is most healthfull and temperate, and Soyle so fertile for Corne
and Cattle, that no place in 
England
 yeeldeth more or better conditioned: sweet Riuers running as
veynes in the body, doe make the Corne bearing grounds in some of her parts rightly to be tear∣med
the 
Gilden Vale:
 and for Waters, Wooll, and Wheate, doth contend with 
Nilus, Colchos,
 and 
E∣gypt:

such are 
Lemster, Irchenfeild,
 the bankes of 
Wye, Luge,
 and 
Frome.


(3) The ancient people knowne to the 
Romanes,
 (whose power they well felt before they could
subdue them) were the 
Silures,
 placed by 
Ptolemie
 in this tract, and branched further into 
Radnor,
Brecknok, Monmouth,
 and 
Glamorgan-shires,
 at this day by vs called 
South-Wales,
 and by the 
Welsh De∣beubarth.

Their Originall, as 
Tacitus
 coniectureth by their site, coloured countenances and curled
haire, was out of 
Spaine,
 and as both he and 
Plinie
 describes them, were fierce, valiant, and impatient
of seruitude, which well they shewed vnder 
Cara
cus
 their Captaine, and nine yeares scourge to
the 
Roman
 assaulters, for whose onely Conquest (and that made by treachery) the Victor in 
Rome

triumphed with more then a vsuall Aspect; and with so equall an hand bare the Scoale of Resistance,
that their owne Writers euermore terme it a dangerous Warre. For the Legion of 
Marius Valens



they put to flight, and that with such hauock of the Associates, that 
Osterius
 the Lieutenant of 
Bri∣taine

for very griefe gaue vp his ghost: and 
Veranius
 vnder 
Nero
 assaulted them in vaine. But when

Vespasian
 was 
Emperour,
 and expert Souldiers imployed in euery Prouince, 
Iulius Frontinus
 subdued
these 
Silures
 vnto the 
Romans,
 where continually some of their Legions afterward kept, till all was
abandoned in 
Valentinians
 time.


(4) The 
Saxons
 then made themselues Lords of this Land, and this Prouince a part of their

Mercians
 Kingdome; yea, and 
Sutton
 the Court of great 
Offa
 their King.


(5) But 
Hereford
 after, raised of the ruines of old 
Ariconium
 (now 
Kenchester,
 shaken in pieces
by a violent Earth quake) grew to great fame, through a conceiued sanctity by the buriall of 
Ethel∣bert

King of the 
East-Angles,
 slaine at 
Sutton
 by 
Offa,
 at what time he came thither to haue espoused to
his Daughter; whose graue was first made at 
Marden,
 but afterwards canonized and remoued to
this Citie, when in honour of him was built the Cathedrall Church by 
Milfrid,
 a pettie King of
that Country, which 
Gruffith
 Prince of 
South-Wales,
 and 
Algar
 an 
Englishman,
 rebelling against
King 
Edward Confessor,
 consumed with fire; but by Bishop 
Remesiu
 was restored at now it is, at what
time the Towne was walled, and is so remaining in good repaire, hauing sixe Gates for entrance,
and fifteen Watch-towers for defence, extending in compasse to fifteen hundred paces: and whence
the 
North-Pole
 is obserued to be raised 52. degrees, 17. minutes in Latitude, and is set from the first
point of the 
West
 in Longitude, 17. degrees and 30. minutes; being yearely gouerned by a Maior,
chosen out of one and thirtie Citizens, which are commonly called the Election, and he euer after
is knowne for an Alderman, and clothed in Scarlet, whereof foure of the eldest are Iustices of Peace,
graced with a Sword-bearer, a Recorder, a Towne-Clerke, and foure Sergeants with Mace.


The greatest glory that this Citie receiued, was in King 
Athelstans
 dayes; where (as 
Malmesbury

doth report) he caused the Lords of 
Wales
 by way of Tribute, to pay yearely (besides Hawkes and


Hounds) twenty pound of Gold, and three hundred pound of Siluer by waight; but how that was
performed and continued I finde not.


(6) Things of rare note in this Shire are said to be, 
Bone well,
 a Spring not farre from 
Richards
Castle,
 wherein are continually found little Fishes bones, but not a sinne seene; and being wholly
cleansed thereof, will notwithstanding haue againe the like, whether naturally produced, or in veynes
thither brought, no man knoweth.


(7) But more admirable was the worke of the Omnipotent, euen in our owne remembrances,
and yeare of Christ Iesus 1571. when the 
Mareley hill
 in the East of this Shire, rouzed it selfe out
of a dead sleepe, with a roaring noise remoued from the placewhere it stood, and for three dayes to∣gether
trauelled from her first site, to the great amazement and feare of the beholders. It began to
journey vpon the seuenth day of 
February,
 being 
Saturday,
 at sixe of the Clocke at night, and by
seauen in the next morning had gone fortie paces, carrying with it Sheepe in their coates, hedge∣rowes,
and trees; whereof some were ouer-turned, and some that stood vpon the plaine, are firmely
growing vpon the hill, those that were East, were turned West; and those in the West 
 set in the
East: in which remoue it ouerthrew 
K
nasten Chappell,
 and turned two high-wayes 
 hundred
yards from their vsuall paths formerly trod. The ground thus trauelling, was abo
 
 six
A∣cres,
which opening it selfe with Rockes and all, bare the earth before it for foure hundred yards
space without any stay, leauing that which was Pasturage in place of the Tillage, and the Tillage
ouerspread with Pasturage. Lastly, ouerwhelming her lower parts, mounted to an hill of twelue fa∣domes
high, and there rested her selfe after three dayes trauell: remaining his marke, that so laid
hand vpon this Rocke, whose power hath poysed the Hils in his Ballance.


(8) Religious Houses built by the deuotions of Princes, and stored with 
Votaries
 and reuenewes
for life, were in this Shire no lesse then thirteene, most sweetly seated in the places as followeth: at


both the 
Herefords, Barron, Ewayot, Clifford, Mone
e, Acornebury, Lemster, Linbroke, Peterchurch,
Kilpek, Dore,
 and 
Wiggemore:
 and suspected of hypocrisie, were called in question by King 
Henry
 the
eight, and so strictly pursued, that some faults were apparant, whereby they were laid open to the
generall Deluge of the Time, whose streame bare downe the walles of all those foundations, car∣rying
away the Shrines of the dead, and defacing the Libraries of their ancient Records.


(9) This Countie before the Conquest being accounted in 
Wales,
 was then strengthened with
Forts against the 
English:
 and being once made a Prounce to 
England,
 was fortified with Castles
against the 
Welsh,
 wherein we finde no lesse then twentie eight, though many of them now are rui∣nated
to nothing. Such were 
Alban,
 at both the 
Ewyats, Godridg, Grosmond, Herdley, Hereford, Old
Castle, Dorston, Brampton, Bredwarden, Saint Biruels, Ledbury, Lenals, Snowdel, Harlewais, Huntington,
Wilton, Wigmore, Richards, Monemue, Corft, Kilbeck, Clifford, Skensfred, Witeney, Radenwer,
 and 
Ke
e∣uenleis;

and is traded with eight Market-Townes, being diuided into eleuen Hundreds, and in
them seated one hundred seauentie and sixe Parish-Churches, containing in compasse an hundred
and two miles.













VVORCESTER-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXV.


VVORCESTER-SHIRE, is a Countie both rich and populour, and lyeth circu∣lated
vpon the 
North
 with 
Stafford
 
 vpon 
 
East
 with 
Warwicke
 and 
Oxford∣shires;

vpon the 
South
 with 
Glacester
 shire, and the 
West
 by 
Maluerne Hils
 is parted
from 
Hereford shire:
 the rest lyeth confronted vpon and in part diuided from

Sh
op-shire
 by the Riuer 
Dowles.


(2) The forme thereof is triangle, but not of equall proportion; for from North to South are
thirtie two miles, from South to North-West twenty two, and from thence to her North-East point
are twenty eight: the whole in Circumference is one hundred and twentie miles.


(3) The Ayre in this Shire is of a fauourable temperature, that giues an appetite for labour, diet,
and rest: the Soyle is fertile, and to me seemed inferiour to notice other in this Land: for besides the
abundance of Corne in euery place spread, the Woods and Pasturage in her hils and plaines, sweet
Riuers that water the vallies below, and Cattle that couer the tops of higher ground; the Fields,
Hedge-rowes, and High-wayes are beset with fruitfull Peare-trees, that yeeld great pleasure to sight,
and commodious vse: for with their iuyce they make a bastard kinde of Wine, called 
Perry,
 which
is both pleasant and good in taste. Many 
Salt Springs
 also this County affordeth; yea, and more
then are commonly in vse: such with the 
Germans,
 our ancient Predecessors, were esteemed most
sacred and holy; so that (as 
Tacitus
 writeth) to such they wontedly resoted to supplicate their 
Gods

with their deuout prayers, as to places neerest the heauens, and therefore the sooner to be heard.
And 
Poets
 in their faynings will haue the 
Nymphs
 residence in shady greene groues, and bankes of


sweet Springs: if so, then (as 
Hellicon)
 this County affords both: such are the Forrests of 
W
re
 and

Feckenham,
 the great woods of 
Norton,
 and most faire Chase of 
Maluerne.
 And for waters, to witnesse
what I say, is the 
Seuera
 that cuts this Shire in the midst, 
Teme, Salwarp,
 and 
Auon,
 all of them ma∣king
fruitfull their passage, and stored with Fish of most delicious taste.


(4) The ancient people, possessors of this Shire, were the CORNAVII, inhabitants of 
Chesse-shire,
Shrop-shire, Stafford,
 and 
Warwicke-shires,
 subdued by the 
Romanes
 in 
Claudius Caesars
 time, and
after their departure, made a portion of the 
Mercian-Saxons
 Kingdome, and in 
Bedaes
 time were cal∣led
the 
Wicij,
 whereof it may be this Shire had the name: vnlesse you will haue it from the 
Salt-Pits,

which in old 
English
 are named 
Wiches;
 or from the famous Forrest of 
Wyre.
 Howsoeuer, true it is
that the County doth hold the name from her chiefe Citie 
Worcester.


(5) Which is most pleasantly seated, passing well frequented, and very richly inhabited. This
was the 
Branouium,
 mentioned by 
Antouine
 and 
Ptolemie,
 called by the 
Britaines, Caer-Wrangon;
 by

Ninius, Caer-Cuorcon;
 and by the 
Latines, Vigornia.
 This Citie is seated vpon the East banke of 
Se∣uerne,

and from the same is walled in triangle-wise about, extending in circuit one thousand sixe
hundred and fiftie paces: thorow which seauen Gates enter, with fiue other Watch Towers for
defence. It is thought the 
Romanes
 built this to restraine the 
Bertaines
 that held 
 beyond 
Seutr
e.

This Citie by 
Hardy Canute
 in the yeare of Christ 1041. was sorely endangered, and set on fire, and
the Citizens slaine almost euery one, for that they had killed his Collector of the 
Danish Tribute:

yet it was presently repaired and peopled, 
with many Burgesses. and for fifteene Hides discharged it selfe
to the Conquerour;
 as in his 
Doomesdayes
 is to be seene. But in the yeare 1113. a sodaine fire happe∣ned,
no man knew how, which burnt the Castle and Cathedrall Church. Likewise in the ciuill
hroyles of King 
Stephen
 it was twice lighted into a flame, and the later laid it hopelesse of recouery.
Notwithstanding from those dead Ashes a new 
Phenix
 arose, and her building raised in a more


stately proportion, especially the Cathedrall dedicated to S. 
Mary,
 first laid by Bishop 
Sexwolfe,

in 
Anno
 680 since when it hath beene augmented almost to the Riuer: In the midst of whose Quire,
from his many turmoiles, resteth the body of King 
Iohn
 (the great with-stander of the 
Popes
 procee∣dings)
vnder a Monument of white Marble, in Princely Vestures, with his portraiture thereon ac∣cording
to life. And in the South-side of the same Quire lyeth intombed Prince 
Arthur
 the eldest
Sonne to King 
Henry
 the seauenth, his Monument is all blacke Iette, without remembrance of him
by Picture.


This City is gouerned by two Bailiffes, two Aldermen, two Chamberlaines, and two Constables,
yearely elected out of twentie-foure Burgesses clothed in Scarlet, assisted with fortie-eight other

Citizens,
 whom they call their 
Common Counsellors,
 clad in Purple, a Recorder, Towne-Clerke, and
fiue Sergeants with Mace their Attendants Whose Geographichall Position is distant in Longitude
from the West-Meridian 18. degrees, 10. scruples, hauing the North-Pole cleuated in Latitude
52. degrees, and 32. scruples.


(6) Places of further note for memorable antiquitie, is 
Vpton,
 of great account in the 
Romane

time, wheresome of their Legions kept, as witnesse their Monies there often found: the admirable
Ditch vpon 
Maluerne hils,
 drawne by 
Gilbert Clare,
 Earle of 
Glocester,
 to diuide his Lands from the
Church of 
Worcester:
 the 
Saxons
 our 
Augustines Oke,
 where he the 
English
 Apostle met with the 
Bri∣tish

Bishops for the vniforme celebration of 
Easter,
 from whence both parts departed with discon∣tented
minds, after many hot word and thwarting disputes.


(7) Neither is it without admiration to me, that many places of this Shire lye farre within the
Precincts of other Prouinces, as 
Aulston, Washbornes, Cuttesden, Paxford, Hanging Easton, Northwick
,
Blockley, Burlode
 in 
Glocester-shire,
 and 
Goldcote, Aldermerston, Newbold, Treddenton, Armiscote, Black∣well,
Darlings-cote, Shi
, Tyd
ton, Olbarrow
 in 
Warwick-shire; Dudley
 in 
Stafford-shire,
 and



Rochford
 in 
Hereford-shire,
 whither I must referre the Reader to finde out these and the like in these
Westerne Tracts.


(8) Religious places erected in this Shire and deuoted vnto God by deuout persons, were

Bredon, Brodlege, Euesholme, Alnecester, Cochell, Fladbury, Maluerin, Pershore, Stodlege, Westwoods,
 and

Worcester,
 plenteously prouided for, and further secured by many priuiledges, both which they abu∣sed,
as were the inditements of all such in the dayes of King 
Henry
 the eight, at whose Barre (him∣selfe
being Iudge) they were found guiltie, and receiued sentence of their ends and destruction.


(9) Castles for defence built in this County, ruinate or in strength, were 
Hartlebury, Holt, Hand∣ley,
Norton, Elmeley,
 and 
Worcester,
 besides his Majesties Mannour of 
Tichnell.


(10) This Shires diuision is into seauen Hundreds, wherein are seated ten Market-Townes,
and one hundred fiftie two Parish-Churches.













VVARWICKE-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXVI.


VVARVVICKE-SHIRE, (so called from her Shire-Towne) is bounded vpon the

North
 with the Countie of 
Stafford;
 vpon the 
East,
 with 
Watling-street-way
 is par∣ted
from 
Leicester shire,
 and the rest bordered vpon by 
Northampton shire:
 the 
South

part is butted by 
Oxford
 and 
Glocester shires;
 and all her 
West
 with the Countie of

Worcester.


(2) The forme thereof is not much vnlike to a 
Scallop shell,
 growing from her Westerne head,
and spreading her body wider, with many indents. The length thereof from 
Newton
 in the North,
to 
L
ug Compton
 in the South, are miles thirtie and three: and the broadest part of this Shire, is from

H
well grange
 in the West, vnto 
Hill morton
 in the East, distant asunder twentie fiue miles; the whole
in Circumference, about one hundred thirtie and fiue miles.


(3) This Shire is sited neere vnto the heart of all 
England,
 and therefore participates with her
in the best both for ayre and soyle, wanting nothing for profit or pleasure for man. The 
South
 part
from 
Auon
 (that runneth thorow the midst of this Countie) is called the 
Feldon,
 as more champion
and tractable to be stirred for Corne, which yearely yeeldeth such plentifull haruest, that the hus∣bandman
sm
th in beholding his paines, and the medowing pastures with their greene mantles so
imbrodred with flowers, that from 
Edg-hill
 we may behold another 
Eden,
 as 
Lot
 did the 
Plaine
 of

Iordon,
 before that 
Sodome
 fell. The 
Woodland
 lyeth vpon the 
North
 of 
Auon,
 so called in regard of
the plentie of 
Woods;
 which now are much thinner by the making of 
Iron,
 and the soile more chur∣lish
to yeeld to the 
Plough.



(4) The ancient people that possessed this 
Prouince,
 are by 
Ptolemies
 description called the 
Cor∣na
ij,

wherein after were seated the 
Mercian-Saxons,
 a part of whose 
Kingdome
 it was, and greatly
sought after by the 
West-Saxons,
 whose King 
Cuthred,
 about the yeare of Christ Iesus 749 in Battle
slew 
Ethelbald
 at 
Seckington
 neere vnto 
Ta
worth.
 And not farre from thence, King 
Edward
 the 4.
as vnfortunately sought against that stout make-King, 
Richard Neuil
 Earle of 
Warwicke:
 neere vnto
which, vpon 
Blacklow-hill, Pierce Gaueston
 (that proud and new-raised Earle of 
Cornwall)
 was be∣headed
by 
Guy
 Earle of 
Warwicke,
 assisted with the Earles of 
Lancaster
 and 
Hereford.
 And surely, by
the testimony of 
Iohn Rosse,
 and others, this County hath beene better replenished with people; who
maketh complaint of whole Towneships depopulations, altogether laid waste by a puissant Armie
of feeding sheepe.


(5) Notwithstanding, many faire Townes it hath, and some of them matchable to the most of

England.
 The chiefe thereof is 
Couentree,
 a Citie both stately for building, and walled for defence:
whose Citizens hauing highly offended their first Lord 
Leofricke,
 had their priuiledges infringed,
and themselues oppressed with many hauie Tributes; whose wife Lady 
Godina
 pitying their estates,
vnceslantly sued for their peace, and that with such importunacie, as hardly could be said whether
was greater, his hatred, or her loue: at last ouercome with her continuall intercessions, he granted
her suir, vpon an vnciuill, and (as he thought) an vnacceptable condition which was, that she should
ride naked thorow the face of the Citie, and that openly at high noone-day. This notwithstanding
she thankfully accepted, and performed the act accordingly enioyned: for this Lady 
G
di
a
 strip∣ping
her selfe of all rich attire, let loose the treffes of her faire haire, which on euery side so couered
her nakednesse, that no part of her body was vnciuill to sight; whereby she redeemed the former free∣domes,
and remission of such heauie 
Tributes.
 Whose memory I wish may remaine honourable in
that 
Citie
 for euer, and her pitie followed by such possessing 
Ladies.



This 
Citie
 had grant to choose their yearely 
Magistrates,
 a 
Maior
 and two 
Bailiffes,
 and to build
about and embattle a wall, by King 
Edward
 the 3. whom 
Henry
 the 6. corporated a 
Countie
 of it selfe,
and changed the names of their 
Bailifs
 into 
Sherifs:
 and the wals then were built as they now stand;
thorow which open 13 
gates
 for entrance, besides 18. other 
Towers
 thereon for defence. At 
Gofford-gate

in the 
East
 hangeth the 
shield-bene
 of a 
wild Bore,
 farre bigger then the greatest 
Oxe-bone:
 with
whose snout the great pit called 
Swanswell
 was turned vp, and was slaine by the famous 
Guy,
 if we
will beleeue report.


Next vnto this Citie, in account and commerce, is 
Warroicke,
 vpon the 
North-west banke

of 
Auon,
 built by 
Gurgunstus,
 the sonne of 
Bel
e,
 as 
Iohn Rosse, Monke
 of the place, saith, 375. yeares
before the birth of Christ: by 
Ninius
 called 
Caer-Guaruic
 and 
Caer-Leon;
 and by learned 
Cambden

judged to be PRAESIDIVM, the 
Romane Garrisons Towne.
 The situation of this place is most plea∣sant,
vpon a hill rising from the 
Riuer,
 ouer which is a strong and faire 
Stone bridge,
 and her sharpe
streame vpon the Towne side checked with a most sumptuous and stately 
Castle,
 the decayes where∣of,
with great cost and curious buildings, the right worthy 
Knight
 Sir 
Foulke Greuil
 (in whose person
shineth all true vertue and high nobilitie) hath repaired: whose merits to me ward I doe acknow∣ledge,
in setting this hand free from the daily imployments of a manuall trade, and giuing it full li∣bertie
thus to expresse the inclination of my minde, himselfe being the 
Procurer
 of my present e∣state.


It seemeth this Towne hath beene walled about, as appeareth by the 
Trench
 in some places seene,
and two very faire 
Gates,
 whose passages are hewed out of the 
Rocke,
 as all other into the Towne
are: ouer whom two beautifull 
Chappels
 are built; that towards the 
East
 called S 
Peters,
 and that on
the 
South-west,
 S 
Iames.


Two faire Churches are therein seated, called S. 
Maries
 and S. 
Nicholas:
 but these in, and about


the Towne suppressed, S. 
Laurence,
 S. 
Michaels, Iohn Baptist,
 and 
Iohn of Ierusalem,
 beside the 
Nunne∣ry

in the North of the Towne: whose 
North Pole
 is eleuated in Latitude 52. degrees, 45 minutes,
and is seated from the first point in the West of Longitude, 18 degrees and 45 minutes, being yeare∣ly
gouerned by a 
Bailiffe,
 twelue 
Brethren,
 twentie foure 
Burgesses
 for 
Common Counsell,
 a 
Recorder,
 a

Towne-Clerke,
 and one 
Sergeant
 their 
Attendant.


(7) Places of most memorable note obserued in this 
Shire,
 are 
Shugbury,
 where the precious
stone 
Astroites
 is found: 
Of-Church,
 which was the 
Palace
 of great 
Offa
 the 
Mercian,
 and the buriall-place
of S. 
Fremund
 his sonne: 
Chesterton,
 where the famous 
Fosse-way
 is seene. At 
Leamington,
 so far
from the 
Sea,
 a 
Spring
 of 
Salt-water
 boileth vp: and at 
Newenham Regis
 most soueraigne water against
the 
Stone, Greene wounds, Vlcers,
 and 
Impostumes;
 and drunke with 
Salt
 looseth, but with 
Sugar
 bin∣deth
the body; and turneth wood into stone as my selfe saw by many sticks that therein were fallen▪
some part of them 
Ash,
 and some part of them 
Stone:
 and 
Guy-Cliffe,
 where the famous Earle 
Guy,

after many painefull exploits atchieued, retired, and vnknowne, lead an 
Hermits
 life, and was lastly
there buried.


(8) The chiefest Commodities in this 
Countie
 growing, are 
Corne,
 whereof the 
Red Horse Vale

yeeldeth most abundantly; 
Woolls
 in great plentie; 
Woods
 and 
Iron,
 though the producer of the one
will be the destruction of the other. Such honourable Families as haue beene dignified with the

Earledome
 of this 
Shire-Townes
 name since the 
Normans Conquest,
 in the great 
Map
 it selfe are inserted,
and by their seuerall names expressed.


This County is strengthned with eight strong 
Castles,
 traded with fifteene 
Market-Townes,
 inriched
with many faire buildings, and by the deuotion of many 
Nobles,
 had many foundations of religious

Monasteries
 therein laid. The chiefest were at 
Stoneley, Warwicke, Thellisford, Roxhall, Balshall, K
g∣worth,


Couentree, Combe, Nun-eaton, Asley, Atherston,
 and 
Pollesworth;
 all which came to their period
in the raigne of King 
Henry
 the eight, when their rich Reuenewes were alienated to his vse, and those
stately buildings either ouer-turned or bestowed vpon his Courtiers: but yet to Gods glory, and
his diuine seruice, one hundred fiftie eight Parish-Churches therein remaine, dispersedly seated in
the nine Hundreds of this Shires Diuision.













NORTHAMPTON-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXVII.


NORTHAMPTON-SHIRE, situated neere vnto the middest of 
England,
 lyeth separtted
vpon the North from 
Lincoln-shire
 by the Riuer 
W
land;
 from 
Hammington-shire
 on the East
is parted by the water 
Nene:
 her South is bounded with 
Buckingham
 and 
Oxford shires,
 and
the West from 
Warwicke
 with 
Watling-street-way, Auon,
 and 
Weland,
 is diuided from 
Lei∣cester-shire.


(2) The forme of this Countie is large and narrow, broadest in the South-west; and thence
shooting still lesser like vnto a Horne, nor not much vnlike to the forme of 
Cornwall:
 and from the
entrance of 
Cherwell
 into this Shire, vnto the fall of 
Weland
 and 
Nene
 neere vnto 
Crowland,
 are by
measure fortie sixe miles; and the broadest part is from 
Ouse
 vnto 
Auon,
 which is not fully twentie
miles: the whole in circumference one hundred and nineteene miles▪


(3) The aire is good, temperate, and healthfull: the soile is champion, rich, and fruitfull, and
so plenteously peopled, that from some Ascents, thirtie Parish-Churches, and many more Wind-milles
at one view may be seene: notwithstanding the simple and gentle sheepe, of all creatures the
most harmelesse, are now become so rauenous, that they begin to deuoure men, waste fields, and
depopulate houses, if not whole Towne-ships, as one merily hath written.


(4) The antient people knowne to the 
Romans,
 and recorded by 
Ptolemie,
 were the 
Coritani,
 who
possessed this Country, and were branched further thorow 
Leicester, Lincolne, Nottingham, Rutland,

and 
Darbie-shires:
 these ioyning with the 
Irenians,
 with them were fettered with the chaines of sub∣iection,
when for 
Claudius, Publius Ostrius Scapula
 entred his Lieutenantship in 
Britaine,
 and in


battle subdued all betwixt the Riuers 
Nene
 and 
Sabrina.
 But when the 
Romans
 were content to let
goe that which so long was desired, and had cost so much in the getting, the 
Saxons,
 a most warlike
Nation put into these parts, and made it a portion of their 
Mercian Kingdome:
 but their gouernment
also growne out of date, the 
Normans
 seated themselues in these faire possessions, the branches of
whole Stemmes are spread abroad in these parts, most fruitfull and faire.


(5) Commodities arising in this Shire, are chiefly gotten by tillage and plough, whereby corne
so plentifully aboundeth, that in no other Countie is found more, or so much: the pastures and
woods are filled with Cattle, and euery where sheepe loaden with their fleeces of wooll.


(6) The chiefe Towne in this Shire is 
Northampton,
 whereof the Countie taketh name, which
for circuit, beautie, and building, may be ranked with the most of the Cities of our Land. It is sea∣ted
at the meeting and confluence of two Riuers, the greater whereof beareth to name 
Nen.
 This
Towne hath beene built all of stone, as by many foundations remaining to this day is seene, and is
walled about both strong and high, excepting the West, which is defended by a Riuer parted into
many streames. In the depredations of the 
Danes, Suen
 their King set this Towne on fire, and after∣wards
it was sorely assulted by the disobedient 
Barons
 of King 
Iohn,
 who named themselues, 
The
Ar
ie of God:
 But the loyaltie of this Towne stood nothing so sure vnto King 
Henry
 his sonne,
whence the 
Barons
 with displayed Banners sounded the Battle against their Soueraigne. And yet af∣ter
this a woefull Field of 
Englands
 ciuill diuision was fought, whence 
Richard Neuil
 the stout Earle
of 
Warwicke,
 lead away prisoner that vnfortunate man King 
Henry
 the sixth. Vpon the West part of
this Towne standeth a large Castle, mounted vpon an hill, whose aged countenance well sheweth
the beautie that she hath borne, and whose gaping chinkes doe daily threaten the downefall of her
walles. To this vpon the South the Townes wall adioyneth, and in a round circuit meeteth the
Riuer in the North, extending in compasse two thousand one hundred and twentie pases: whose


fire so pleased the Students of 
Cambridge,
 that thither they remoued themselues vpon the Kings War∣rant,
in minde to haue made it on an Vniuersitie: from whence the North-pole is eleuated 52. degrees
36. scruples for Latitude, and in Longitude is remoued from the West 19 degrees and 40 scruples;
being yearely gouerned by a Maior, two Bailiffes, twelue Magistrates, a Recorder, Towne-Clerke,
a Common Counsell of fortie eight Burgesses, with fiue Sergeants to execute businesse.


(7) But the deuotions of the 
Saxon-Kings
 made 
Peterborow
 more famous, formerly called 
Med∣deswell,

where 
Wolphere
 King of 
Mercia
 began a most stately Monastery to the honour of S. 
Peter,

for satisfaction of the bloud of his two sonnes, whom he had murdered in case of Christianitie:
but himselfe being for the like made away by his mother, his brother 
Penda
 continued the worke,
with the assistance of his brother 
Ethelred,
 and two sisters, 
Kineburga
 and 
Kineswith.
 This among
the 
Danish Desobutions
 was cast downe, yet was it againe restored to greater beautie by 
Ethelwold
 Bi∣shop
of 
Winchester,
 with the helpe of King 
Edgar,
 and of 
Adulph
 his Chancellour, who vpon pricke
of Conscience, that in bed with his wife had ouerlaid and smoothered an Infant their onely sonne,
laid all his wealth vpon the reedifying of the place, and then became 
Abbot
 thereof himselfe. The
Cathedrall is most beautifull and magnificall, where, in the Quire lie interred two vnfortunate
Queenes: on the North side 
Katharine Dewager
 of 
Spaine,
 the repudiate wife of King 
Henry
 the
eight, vnder an Hearse couered with blacke Saye, hauing a white Crosse in the midst: and on the
South-side, 
Mary
 Queene of 
Scotland,
 whose Hearte is spread ouer with blacke Veluet▪ The Cloy∣ster
is large, and in the glasse-windowes very curiously portraied the History of 
Wolphere
 the Foun∣der,
whose Royall Seat was at 
Wedon
 in the street, conuerted into a Monastery by S 
Werburg
 his ho∣ly
daughter, and had beene the 
Roman
 Station, by 
Antonine
 the Emperour called 
Bannauenna.
 So
likewise 
Norman-chester
 was the ancient Citie 
Durobriuae,
 where their Souldiers kept, as by the mo∣nies
there daily found is most apparent.



(8) Houses of Religion deuoted to Gods Seruice by the pious intents of their well-meaning
Founders were at 
Peterborow, Peakirk, Pipewell, Higham, Dauintree, Sulby, Sausecombe, Sewardesug,
Gare,
 S 
Dewy,
 S 
Michell, Luffeild, Catesby, Brvth, Barkley, Finishead, Fotheringhay, Wedon,
 and 
Wi∣th
p,

besides them in 
Northampton,
 all which felt the stormes of their owne destruction, that raged
against them in the Raigne of King 
Henry
 the eight, who dispersed their Reuenewes to his owne Cof∣fers
and Courtiers, and ulled the stones asunder or their seeming euer-sure Foundations; and in the
time of young 
Edward,
 his sonne, whose minde was free from wronging the dead, the Tombes of
his owne Predecessours were not spared, when as 
Edward
 slaine at 
Agincourt,
 and 
Richard
 at 
Wake∣field,

both of them Dukes of 
Yorke,
 were after death assaulted with the weapons of destruction, that
cast downe their most faire Monuments in the Collegiate Church of 
Fotheringhay Castle.


(9) Eight Princely Families haue enioyed the Title of the Earledome of 
Northampton,
 whereof
the last, 
Henry Hawara,
 late 
Lord Priuie Seale,
 a most honourble Patron to all learned proceedings
(that I may acknowledge my dutifull and humble Seruice) hath most honourably assisted and set
forward these my endeuours.


(10) This Shires diuision, for seruice to the Crowne, and imployment of businesses, is into
twentie Hundreds, hath beene strengthned with ten Castles, and is still traded with ten Market-Townes,
and God honoured in three hundred twentie-sixe Parish-Churches.













HVNTINGTON-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXVIII.


HVNTINGTON-SHIRE, (part of the 
leui
 vnder the 
Romane
 Monarch of 
Mertia
 in the

Saxon
 Heptarchy) is seuered with 
Nene,
 the North-bounder from 
Northamptonshire,
 to which
it in part adioyneth West; from 
Bedford
 and 
Cambridge,
 by mearing Townes on the South;
and from 
Ely,
 by a sence of water East, theworke of Nature, 
Benwicke
 Streame, or of Art,

Canutus Delph:
 seuered when 
Alfred,
 or before him, 
Offa
 shared the open circuit of their Em∣pery
into Principalities: that by residency of subordinate rule, Peace at home might be maintained;
Fortaine offence (by apt assembly of the Inhabitants) resisted; Taxe and Reuenew of the Crowne
laid more euenly, and easierly leuyed; Iustice at mens dores with lesse charge and iourney admini∣stered:
all causes 
Ciuill
 hauing a right and speedy dispatch, in the County or Earles monethly Court,
as 
Criminall
 in his Lieutenant the Sheriffes Turne, twice a yeare. In forme of a Lozeng this Shire
lyeth, of positure temperate, and is 52. degrees, 4. scruples remoued from the Aequator: the Hilly
Soyle to the Plough-man gratefull: the Vale, contiguous to the Fennes, best for Pasture, in which
to no part of 
England
 it giueth place: Woods are not much wanted, the Riuers seruing Coale, as the
Moores Turffe, for fuell.


(2) This Content was (as the whole Continent) Forrest, vntill 
Canutus
 gaue this Law of grace,

Vt quisque tam in agris, quam in siluis excitet agitet{que} feras.
 Long were were the hands of Kings to pull
(of old) the Subiects right into Regall pleasure, when Perambulation & Proclamation onely might
make any mans land Forrest. It is in the first 
Williams
 time a Phrase in Record not rare, 
Silua bu

Maner
 FORIS EST 
missa in Siluam Reg
s,
 from which word of power, 
Forrest
 may seeme not vn∣aptly


to be deriued. 
Cum videbat Henricus primus tres Bissas,
 fitting his Forrest of 
Lyfield,
 he caused

Husculphus
 his Raunger to keepe them for his Game, as the Record doth testifie. Thus did the se∣cond
of his name, and the first 
Richard,
 in many parts: well therefore may the Exchequer-Booke call
the Forrest Iustice for Vert and Venison, not 
Iustum absolutè,
 but 
Iustum secundum Legem Forresta.

That 
Foresta
 is defined, 
Tuta serarum s
ain,
 may seeme to confine the Forresters office onely to his
Games care, which of ancient was as well ouer Minerall and Maritimall reuenew. The office of

Baldwme
 the great Forrester of 
Flanders, Non agrum tantum spectabat, sed et Maris custodiam,
 saith

Tullius,
 out of the old Charters of the 
French
 Kings. And see how iust this squares to our Legall
practise, for of 
Assarts, Purprestures, E
prousment, Greenebugh, Herbage, Paunage, Fowles, Mils, Hony,
Mine
, Quarries,
 and 
Wreacks
 at Sea, did the 
inerall Iustice of the Forrest here enquire. His Sub∣iects
of this Shire, 
Henry
 the 2. from seruitude of his beasts, (whose Grand-father 
pro 
eris homines
incarc
rauit, exhareditauit, mutilauit, 
)
 did pretend by Charter to enfranchise, except 
Wa∣bridge,
Saple, Herthy,
 his owne Demaines. But such was the successe by encrochments, vnder his
two succeeding Sonnes, that it drew on the oppressed people to importune a new the Soueraignes
redresse, which was by the great Charter of the third 
Henry
 fruitlesly effected His sonne in the 7. of
his Raigne, by a Perambulation, resuming backe the fruit of his fathers goodnesse, and so retaining,
vntill in his 29. yeare by Petition, and purchase of his people (for they gaue him a full Fifteene)
he confirmed the former Charter, and by Iury, View and Perambulation setled that Boundary of
Forrest, which contented the people, became the square of vniuersall Iustice in this kinde, and left
in this Shire no more then the three former (his owne grounds) Forrest.


(3) This Shire hath foure 
Centuriatae
 or 
Hundreds,
 and had of old time fiue, these so called, 
Quia
prima institutione ex Hederum aliquet centenarijs compositae.
 These are subdiuided into 79. Parishes,
whereof fiue besides the Shire-Towne haue Markets. These Parishes are measured by Hides, and


Carucks, or Plough-lands, more or lesse, as either richnes of Soile, or strength of the Lord strength∣ned
or extended their limits, the Masse in whole containing of the first sort, 818. and of the other,
1136. These Hides the ancient and generall measure of land (except in 
Kent)
 where the account
was by 
Solms;
 or 
Lincolnshire, Vbinon sunt Hida, sed pro Hidis sunt Carucatae)
 were esteemed one hun∣dred
Acres, 
Non Normanico sed Anglico numero, vna Hida pro sexies viginti Acris, 
uo produ
dec
es
 
,
as in the Booke of 
Domesday Caruca
 the Teame-land (not 
Ca
ucata
 for they be different) was
in quantitie of Acres, proportioned to the qualitie of Soile, but vsually in this Shire reputed 60.
The 
rgata,
 or Yard-land, was a more or lesse part of the 
Hide,
 as the Acres in number varied,
which I finde in this Countie from 18. to 42 but for the most part 30 which was the halfe Plough∣land
And the 
Bouata
 or 
Oxgang
 (presumed in Law for Land in 
Granary)
 was suited in number of
Acres to that Yard-land, of which it was a Moitie. Thus (except in the Fennes, laid out 
per Leucas
& quarentenas,
 miles and furlongs) stands all a measurement of Land in this Shire, which containeth
in Knights Fees, 53 one halfe, 2 fifts, and a twentieth part. And in full estimation of rent and
worth, rose in the time of the Conquerour, to 912. l. 4. s. and now payeth in 
Fifteene
 to the King,
371. l. 9. s. 7. 
 and in tenth from the Clergie, 142. l. 6. s. q.


(4) This Countie in discition of Titles, and administration of Iustice, 
did at the first, as the Ger∣mans
our Ancestors, Iurape
 Pagos & vicos reddere; Euery Towneship by their Friburgi, or Tenmentall,

as Triers, 
and the Baron, Thain, or Head-lord there,
 or the 
Decanus
 (a good Freholder) his Deputie,
as Iudge, determining all ciuill causes; a representation of this remaineth still in our Court-Lecte.
Aboue this, and held 12. times a yeare, was our Hundred or Wapentake. 
Quae super decem Decan
s
& centum Friburgosiudicabat.
 Here the Iudges were the Aldermen, and Barons or Free-holders of
that Hundred; 
Aegelwinus Aldermannus tenuit placitum cum toto Hundredo,
 saith the Booke of 
Ely.

This Court had Cognoscence of Causes Ecclesiasticall, as Temporall, therefore the Iudge or Al∣derman


ought to be such as 
Dei leges & hominum iura studebat promouere:
 thus it went although the
Conquerour commanded, 
Ne Aliquis de legibus Episcopalibus amplius in Hundredo placita teneret.

The next and highest in this Shire, was 
Generale pla
ū Comitatus,
 (the County or Sheriffes Count)
to which were proper 
Placita Ciuilia vbi curia Deminorum probantur defecisse. Et sit placitum exurga

inter Vauafores duorum Dominorum tractetur in Comitatis.
 The Iudge was the Earle or Sheriffe. The
Tryers 
Barones Comitatus
 (Freholders) 
Quiliberat in eo terr
 habent,
 not Ciuill onely, but Probats
of Wils, Questions of Tithes, 
Et debita verae Christianitatis Iura,
 were heard, and first heard in this
Court. Therefore 
Episcopus, Presbyter Ecclesia, & Quatuor de melioribus villae,
 were a diuncts to the
Sheriffe, 
Qui dei lege
 & secul
 negotia iusta consideratione difinirent.
 The Lay part of this liueth in a
sort in the Countie, and Sheriffe Turne; the Spirituall, about the raigne of King 
Stephen,
 by Soue∣raigne
conniuence, suffered for the most into the quarterly Synode of the Clergie, from whence in
imitation of the 
Hundred Court,
 part was remitted to the 
Rurall Deaneries,
 of which this Shire had
foure: And these againe haue beene since swallowed vp by a more frequent and superiour Iurisdicti∣on,
as some of our Ciuill Courts haue beene. There being now left in vse for the most in this Shire
for Causes Criminall, 
View of Frankpl
g,
 by grant or prescription, 
A Session of the Peace
 quarterly, and
two 
Goale deliueries
 by the Soueraignes commission: and for 
Ciuill Causes, Courts of Manours,
 or of
the 
County mon
bly,
 and 
twice by the Iudges of Assise yearely


The Office of Execution and custody of this County is the 
Sheralfey,
 of old inheritable, vntill

Eustachius,
 who by force and fauour of the Conquerour disseised 
Aluric
 and his heyres, forfeited it
to the Crowne; but since it hath passed by annuall election, and hath vnited to it the County of

Cambridge.


(5) Hauing thus farre spoken of the Shire in generall, next in obseruation falleth the Shire-Towne

Huntingdon,
 Hundandun, or the 
Hunters Downs,
 North, seated vpon a rising banke, ouer the


rich meadowing riuer 
Owse,
 interpreted by some Authors, the 
Downe of Hunters,
 to which their now
common Seale (a Hunter) seemeth to allude. Great and populous was this in the fore-going age,
the following hauing here buried of fifteene all but three, besides the Mother-Church S. 
Maries,
 in
their owne graues. At the raigne of the Conquerour, it was ranged into foure Ferlings or Wards,
and in them 256. 
Burgenses
 or Housholds: It answered at all assessments for 50. 
Hides,
 the fourth part
of 
Hurstingston
 Hundred in which it standeth. The annuall rent was then 30. l of which, as of three
Minters there kept, the King had two parts, the Earle the third; the power of 
Coynage
 then and be∣fore,
not being so priuatiuely in the King, but Borowes, Bishops, and Earles enioyed it; on the one
side stamping the face and stile of their Soueraigne, in acknowledgement of subordinacie in that
part of absolute power, and on the reuerse their owne name, to warrant their integritie in that infi∣nite
trust.


(6) The Castle supposed by some the worke of the Elder 
Edward,
 but seeming by the Booke of

Domesday,
 to be built by the Conquerour, is now knowne but by the ruines: It was the seate of 
Wal∣theof

the great 
Saxon
 Earle, as of his succeeding heyres, vntill to end the question of right betweene

Se
ice
 and the King of 
Scots, Henry
 the second, laid it as you see; yet doth it remaine the head of
that honour, on which in other Shires many Knights Fees, and sixteene in this attended Here 
Dauid

Earle of this and 
Arguise,
 father of 
Isabel de Brus,
 founded the Hospitall of S. 
Iohn Baptist:
 And 
Lo
∣tote

here vpon the Fee of 
Eustace
 the Vicount, built to the honour of the blessed Virgin, the Priory
of Blacke Channons, valued at the Suppression, 232 l. 7. s. ob. Here at the North end was a house
of Fryers, and without the Towne at 
Hinchingbrooke,
 a Cloister of Nunnes, valued at 19. l. 9. s. 2. d.
founded by the first 
William,
 in place of S. 
Pandonia,
 at 
Eltesley
 (by him suppressed) where neere the
end of the last 
Henry
 the Family of the 
Cromwels
 began their Seat. To this Shire-Towne, and bene∣fit
of the neighbour Countries, this Riuer was nauigable, vntill the power of 
Grey,
 a mynion of the


time, stopt that passage, and with it all redresse eyther by Law or Parliament. By Charter of King

Iohn
 this Towne hath a peculiar Coroner, profit by Toll and Custome, Recorder, Towne-Clerks,
and two Bayliffes, (elected annually for gouernment) as at Parliament two Burgesses, for aduise
and assent: and is Lord of it selfe in Fee-Farme.


The rest of the Hundred (wherein this Shire-Towne lyeth) is the East part of the County,
and of 
Hurst
 a Parish in the center of it, named HVRSTINGSTON, it was the Fee-farme of 
Ramsey
Abbey,
 which on a point of fertile land, thrust out into the Fennes, is therein situate, founded in the
yeare 969 to God, our Lady, and S. 
Benedicte,
 by Farle 
Aylwin
 of the Royall bloud, replenished
with Monkes from 
Westbury,
 by 
Oswold
 of 
Yorke,
 and dedicated by 
D
nstan
 of 
Canterburie,
 Archbi∣shops.
By Abbat 
Reg
ald
 1114 this Church was redified, by 
Magna
ll
 Earle of 
Essex,
 not long
after spoyled and by 
Henry
 the Third, first of all the 
Norman
 Princes, visited; when wasted with the

 warres, 
Regalis mensae Hospitalitas it abbreuiata fuit, vt cum Abbatibus, Clericis & viris satis
humilibus, hospitia quaesunt & prandia
 This Monastery (the shrine of two martyred Kings, 
Ethel∣bright

and 
Ethelred,
 and of Saint 
 the 
Persian
 Bishop) by humble pietie at first, and pious charitie,
ascended such a pitch of worldly fortune, that it transformed their Founder (religious pouertie)
into their ruine, the attribute of 
Ra
y the rich:
 for hauing made themselues Lords of 387. Hides
of land (whereof 
 in this Shire, so much as at an easie and vnder rent, was at the Suppression
valued at 1983 l 15 s 3. d q. but by account of this time annually amounts to 7000 
) they
then began to affect popular command, and first inclosing that large circuit of land and water (for in
it lyeth the Mile-square Meere of 
Ramsey)
 as a peculiar Seignory to them, called the 
Balent
 or 
Ban∣dy

(bounded as the Shire, from 
E
y,
 and from 
Norman-Crosse
 with the Hundred Meere) by Soue∣raigne
Grant they enioyed regall libertie. And then aspiring a step further, (to place in Parliament)
made 
Broughton
 the head of their Baro
e, annexing to it in this Shire foure Knights Fees. Thus in


great glory it stood aboue 400. yeares, vntill 
Henry
 the Eight (amongst many other once bright
Lamps of Learning and Religion in this State, though then obscured with those blemishes to wealth
and ease concomitant) dissolued the house, although 
Iohn Warboys
 then Abbot, and his 60 blacke
Monkes there maintained, were of the first that vnder their hands and conuentuall Seale protested,

Quod Romanus Pontifex non habet maiorem aliquam Iurisdictionem collatam sibi à Deo in Regno Angliae
quam quivis alius externus Episcopus.
 A Cell to this rich Monastery was S. 
Iuces
 Priory, built in that
place of 
Slep,
 by Earle 
Adelmus,
 in the raigne of the last 
Edmund,
 where the incorrupted body of S.

Ius
 there once an Hermit, in a vision reuealed, was by 
Ednothus
 taken vp in his Robes Episcopall,
and dedicated in the presence of 
Siward
 Earle of this Countie, and that Lady of renowned piety

Ethelfleda,
 to the sacred memory of this Persian Bishop. Not farre from this is 
Somersham,
 the gift
of the 
Saxon
 Earle 
Brithnothus
 to the Church of 
Ely,
 before his owne fatall expedition against the

Danes:
 It is the head of those fiue Townes, of which the Soke is composed, and was an house to the
See of 
Ely,
 well beautified by 
Iohn Stanley
 their Bishop: but now by exchange is annexed to the
Crowne As these, so all the rest of this Hundred, was the Churches land, except 
Rippon Regis
 anci∣ent
Demaine. To which 
Saple
 (reserued Forrest) adioyned, and the greater 
Stiuecly,
 giuen by the
last 
Dauid
 Earle of 
Huntingdon,
 in Fee to his three Seruants, 
Sentlice, Lakerutle,
 and 
Camoys.


(8) NORMANS CROS the next Hundred, taketh name of a Crosse aboue 
Stilton,
 the
place where in former ages this Diuision mustered their people, whence Wapentake is deriued: it
had in it two religious houses, the eldest in the confines of 
Newton
 and 
Chesterton,
 neere the Riuer of

Auon,
 now 
Nene,
 founded (by the first Abbesse 
Kineburga
 the Daughter of 
Penda,
 and Wife of 
Ael∣fred,

King of 
Northumberland)
 West side a Trench, where 
Ermin-street-way
 crossed ouer the Riuer
by a Stone-bridge, whose ruines are now drowned, whence the 
Roman
 Towne there sea
ed on both
sides tooke the name 
Durobriua,
 as 
Traiectus Fluminis.
 But this Nunnery as raised, was also ruined


by the 
Danes
 before the Conquest The other a Monastery of 
Cistertian
 blacke Monks, erected in ho∣nour
of the Virgin 
Mary,
 by the second 
Simon
 Earle of 
Huntington,
 at 
Saltry Iudeth,
 the Land of a
Lady of that name, wife of Earle 
Waltheof,
 daughter to 
Lambert
 Earle of

 Neece to the Con∣querour
by his Sister, (her Mother) and Grand-mother to this Founder 
Malcome,
 & 
William,
 Kings
of 
Scots,
 Earles of 
Hamingdon,
 and Heires of this Lady, strengthened by seuerall Charters this pious
worke. Many chiefe of that Line, as the last Earle 
Dauid,
 brother to King 
William,
 as 
Isabel,
 the wife
of 
Robert d
 Brus
 his Daughter heyre; and most of the second branch, her Progenie making here
their Burials. This house now leuell with the ground, maintained besides the Abbot, sixe Monkes,
and 22 Hindes, and was at the Suppression valued at 199. l. 11. c. 8. d The Founders and Patrons
of this Monastery were the Lords of the next place 
Connington,
 first the seate of 
Turkillus
 Earle of
the 
East-Angles,
 that inuited 
Swayn
 from 
Denmarke
 to inuade this Land: and who first squared out
the vnbounded marishes of this part, to the bordering Townes; his rule of proportion allowing to
euery Parish 
tantum de Ma
isco, quantum de sicca terra
 in bredth, in which none, 
sine licentia Domini

might 
vel federe, vel salcare,
 but leauing most to inter-common by 
vicinage.
 This 
Dane
 exiled (when
the rest of his Countreymen were by 
Edward Confessor)
 his land here was giuen to Earle 

by whose eldest heire 
Matilda
 marryed to 
Dauid
 King of 
Scots,
 it went along in that Male line, vn∣till
by death issuelesse of 
Iohn
 Earle of 
Chester
 and 
Huntingdon,
 it fell in partage, to his sister 
I
abel de
Brus,
 one of his heires, from whose second Sonne 
Bernard,
 the Familie of 
Cotton
 by lineall succession
holdeth this Land, whereto 
Glarton
 the adioyning Parish is now by bountie of a second branch an∣nexed.
It was in this Shire the head of the honour of 
Belleine,
 on which 
, 
Sibson,


, and 
Ves
yes
 Mannor in 
Chesterton
 attended: part of it is the fre
 Sea

Emma,
 and her Children, the issue of 
Canuti

 sayled with some
perill, her Husband in preuention of the like, from 
Bottsey
 in a strait course to the opposite firme


land, lined with his Attendant Swords that passage, which since hath borne the name of 
Swords
Delph, Kings
 or 
Canutus dyke.
 This Seignory was granted by the Conquerour to 
Eustace
 Earle of

Bollein,
 Brother to 
Lambert
 Earle of 
Leins,
 and Father to 
Godfrey
 King of 
Ierusalem;
 reuerting it was
giuen to 
Richard
 Earle of 
Cornwall,
 who granted out of it the two Meeres, 
Vbbe Meere
 and 
Brich
Meere,
 in Fee-Farme to the Church of 
Ramsey
 Then after sundry changes it came to 
Iohn
 of 
Gaunt,

in exchange of the Earledome of 
Richmond,
 and so by descent fell againe into the Crowne 
Washing∣ley,

(not farre off) from the ancient Lord of that name, by 
D
we,
 and 
Otter
 came to the 
Prices
 that
now posseth it. In 
Chesterton
 from 
Wadsheafe
 by 
Dennyes
 there is to the 
Beuils
 (an ancient name in
this Shire) a Mannor descended. The rest from 
Aegidius de Merke
 (who gaue there much to 
Royston

Priory) passed by 
Amundeuill
 to 
Gloucester,
 and so to 
Vesey
 by exchange. In 
Elton,
 the house rich in a
beautious Chappell, from 
Denham
 to 
Sapcotes,
 and 
Saultre Beaumes,
 from that surname (neere the
time of the Conquest) by 
Louth
 to 
Cornwallis
 descended; as 
Bottlebridge
 by 
Gimels, Drayton, Louet,

vnto 
Sherley
 the now Lord.


(9) LETTVNESTAN HVNDRED hath that name from 
Leighton,
 a Towne in
the middest of it, giuen by Earle 
Waltheof
 to the Church of 
Lincolne,
 which after shared it into two
Prebendaries. One, the Parsonage impropriate, which still remaineth: the other (the Lordships)
was resumed by 
Henry
 the eight, and now by the Heire of 
Darcy
 matched to the Lord 
Clifton,
 is be∣come
the seate of his Barony. This Hundred had in it no house of Religion, but 
Stonley
 a Priorie of
seauen blacke Channons, of the order of S. 
Augustine,
 founded by the 
Bigrames,
 and at the Suppres∣sion
valued at 62. l. 12. s 3. d ob. It stood within the reach of the great Mannor 
Kimbolton
 (once an
Hundred) which was the land of Earle 
Harold
 the Vsurper: after by Graunt it came with the Chase
of 
Swinesheued
 to 
Fitz-Peter,
 from whom by 
Magnauil
 to 
Bohum
 (who in time of the 

Barons built there a Forcelet) and so to 
Stafford,
 by whose attainturre forsaited, it was giuen by



Henry
 the eight to the Familie of 
Wingfield
 that now possesseth it. At 
Bugden
 the See of 
Lincolne
 hath
a seate, and was Lord of 
Spaldwick,
 and the 
Soke
 (giuen in compensation from the Church of 
Ely,

when rent from them, it was by the first 
Henry
 made a Bishopricke) vntill of late that Church gaue
vp their interest in 
Spaldwicke
 to the Crowne. 
Brampton
 was giuen by King 
Iohn
 at 
Mirabel,
 to Earle

Dauid,
 and by 
Ada
 his youngest Daughter fell to 
Hastings
 Earle of 
Pembroke,
 and now is reuerted
to the King To the same Earle 
Dauid
 by gift of the former King came 
Alcumesbury,
 and by the
bounty of 
Iohn Scot
 his sonne to 
Segraue,
 and so to the Lord 
Barkley
 the late possessor. To 
Serlo de
Quincy
 
arle of 
Winthester,
 was 
Keston
 by 
Henry
 the second giuen, by whose Heyre generall 
Ferrars,

it came to the late Earle of 
Essex,
 and by exchange to the Crowne.


(10) TOVLESLAND HVNDRED, taketh name likewise of a Towne therein si∣tuate.
In the out Angle of this, to the memory of S. 
Neotus
 a Monke of 
Glasterbury,
 but the suppo∣sed
sonne to 
 King of the 
West-Saxons
 (whose body from 
 in 
Cornwall
 was trans∣ferred
to 
Arnalphesbury,
 then of 
Arnulphus
 a holy man, now 
Eynesbury
 named) Earle 
Alrick
 and 
E∣thelfleda

turned the Palace of Earle 
Elfred
 into a Monastery of blacke Monkes, which was razed by
the 
Danes;
 but out of the ashes of this, 
Roisia
 (wife to 
Richard
 the sonne of Earle 
Gilbert)
 to God,
our Lady 
de Becco,
 and S. 
Neot
 (as a Cell to the Abbey of 
Becco
 in 
Normandy)
 erected vp of blacke
Monkes in the yeare 1113. the late Priorie of S. 
Nedes,
 suppressed by 
Henry
 the eight, and valued at
256. l. 15. d q. At 
Southo
 (the Land of 
Eustachius
 the Sheriffe) 
Louetote
 made the seate of that
Seignory: on which in this Shire 13. Knights Fees and a halfe depended: But from his line by gift
of 
Verdon
 and 
Vesey
 drowned were these in the honour of 
Gloucester.
 Neare to this at 
Cretingsbury

dwelt Sir 
Adam de Cretings,

Gilbert de Gaunt,
 after the death
issuelesse of 
De Rupes,
 escheated to the King, who gaue it to

 descended to the Ba∣rons
of 
Berkly, Godmanchester,
 or 
Gormonchester,
 (so named of that 
Dane
 to whom 
Aelfred
 at his con∣uersion
granted some regiment in these parts) was the olde land of the Crowne, now the Inhabi∣tants
in fee farme, by grant of King 
Iohn, pro Sexies viginti libris pondere & numero.
 It is flat seated
by as fruitfull and flowry Meadowes as any this Kingdome yeeldeth, and is the most spacious of a∣ny
one Parish in fertile tillage, oft hauing waited on their Soueraigne Lords with ninescore Ploughes
in a rurall pompe: Some from the name 
Gunicester
 (which this often beareth in record,) suppose it
the Citie where 
Machutus
 placed his Bishops Chayre. But for certaine it was that 
Romane
 Towne

Durosipont,
 of the Bridges named, so many hundred yeares (vntill the light of our 
Britain
 Story o∣uershone
it) forgotten. Thus as this Citie so the olde Families haue beene here with time outworne,
few onely (of the many former) now remaining, whose Surnames before the raigne of the last 
Hen∣ry

were in this Shire of any eminency. But,

Non indignemur mortalia Nomina solui,


Cernimus exemplis Oppida posse mort.


Let's not repine that Men and names doe dye,


Since stone-built Cities dead and ruin'd lye.


This Description I receiued from a right worthy and learned Friend.













RVTLAND-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXIX.


RVTLAND-SHIRE, the least of any County in this Realme, is circulated vpon the North
with 
Lincolne-shire;
 vpon the East and South, by the Riuer 
Weland
 is parted from 
Northamp∣ton
shire;
 and the West is altogether held in with 
Leicester-shire.


(2) The forme thereof is round, and no larger in compasse then a light horse-man can ea∣sily
ride about in a day▪ vpon which occasion some will haue the Shire named of one 
Rut,

that so rode. But others from the rednesse of the Soile, will haue it called 
Rutland,
 and so the old 
En∣glish-Saxons

called it, for that 
Roet
 and 
Rut
 is in their tongue 
Red
 with vs, and may very well giue the
name to this Prouince, seeing the earth doth staine the wooll of her sheepe into a reddish colour.
Neither is it strange, that the staine of the soyle giues names vnto places, and that very many: for
haue we not in 
Chesse-shire
 the 
Red Rocke,
 in 
Lancashire
 the 
Red Banke,
 and in 
Wales, Rutland Castle?

To speake nothing of that famous 
Red Sea
 which shooteth into the Land betwixt 
Egypt
 and 
Arabia,

which gaue backe her waters for the 
Israelites
 to passe on foote: all of them named from the colour
of the Soile.


(3) The longest part of this Shire is from 
Caldecot
 in the South vpon the Riuer 
Ey,
 
 to 
Thistle∣ton

a small Village seated in the North, not fully twelue miles: and from 
Timwell
 East-ward, to

Wissenden
 in the West, her broadest extant, is hardly nine: the whole circumference about fortie
miles.


(4) The ayre is good both for health and delight, subiect to neither extremity of heat nor cold,
nor is greatly troubled with foggy mists.



The Soile is rich, and for Corne and tillage giues place vnto none. Woods there are plentie, and
many of them imparked, hills feeding heards of Neate, and flockes of sheepe; Vallies besprinkled
with many sweet Springs; Graine in abundance, and Pastures not wanting: in a word, all things
ministred to the content of life, with a liberall heart and open hand Onely this is obiected, that
the Circuit is not great.


(5) The draught whereof, that I may acknowledge my dutie and his right, I receiued at the
hands of the right Honourable 
Iohn
 Lord 
Harrington, Baron
 of 
Exton,
 done by himselfe in his yon∣ger
yeares.


Neere vnto his house 
Burley,
 standeth 
Okham
 a faire Market-Towne, which Lordship the said

Baron
 enioyeth, with a Royaltie somewhat extraordinary, which is this: If any Noble by birth
come within the precinct of the same Lordship, he shall forfeit as an homage a shooe from the horse
whereon he rideth, vnlesse he redeeme it at a price with money In witnesse whereof, there are ma∣ny
Horse-shooes nayled vpon the Shire-Hall doore, some of large size and ancient fashion, others
new, and of our present Nobilitie; whose names are thereupon stamped as followeth:



Henry Hastings.


Roger Rutland.


Edward L. Russell, Earle of Bedford.


Raphe L. Euwer of Parram.


Henry L. Bertley.


Henry L. Mordant.


William L. Compton.



Edward L. Dudley.


Henry L. Winsor.


George, Earle of Cumberland.


Philip, Earle of Montgomery.


L. Willoughby.


P. L. Wharton.


The Lord Shandois.




Besides many others without names.


That such homage was his due, the said Lord himselfe told me; and at that instant a suit depen∣ded
in Law against the 
Eirle of Lincolne,
 who refused to forfeit the penaltie, or to pay his sine.


(6) Her ancient Inhabitants knowne to the 
Romones,
 and mentioned in 
Ptolemit,
 were the 
Cori∣tan
,

and by him branched thorow 
Leicester, Lincolne, Nottingham, Darby-shire
 and this; who with
the 
Icemans
 were subdued by 
P. Ostorius
 vnder the yoke of 
Claudius
 the 
Roman Emperour:
 and at their
departure, by conquest the 
Saxons
 made it a Prounce vnto their 
Mercian Kingdome,
 whose fortunes
likewise comming to a full period, the 
Normans
 annexed it vnder their Crowne.


(7) This Countie King 
Edward Confessor
 bequeathed by his Testament vnto Queene 
Eadgith

his wife, and after her decease vnto his Monastery at 
Westminster,
 which 
William the Conquerour
 can∣celled
and made voyd, bestowing the Lands vpon others, the Tithes and the Church vnto those
Monkes▪


That the 
Ferrers
 here first seated, besides the credit of Writers, the Horse-shooe whose badge then
it was, doth witnesse; where in the Castle, and now the Shire-hall, right ouer the Seat of the


Iudge, a Horse-shooe of iron curiously wrought, containing fiue foot and a halfe in length, and the
bredth thereto proportionably is fixed. The Castle hath beene strong, but now is decayed, the
Church faire, and the Towne spacious; whose degree of Longitude is 19. 46. scruples, and the
North poles eleuation in Latitude 53. degrees and 7. minutes.


(8) Let it not seeme offen siue, that I (to fill vp this little Shire,) haue inserted the seate of a
Towne not sited in this County: for besides the conueniency of place, the circuit and beautie, but
especially it being for a time an Vniuersitie, did moue much; yea, and the first in this Iland, if 
Iohn
Hardings
 Author faile him not, that will haue 
Bladud
 to bring from 
Athens
 certaine 
Philosophers,

whom here he seated, and made publike profession of the Liberall Sciences, where (as he saith) a
great number of Scholars studied the Arts, and so continued an Vniuersitie vnto the comming of

Augustine,
 at which time the Bishop of 
Rome
 interdicted it; for certaine Heresies sprung vp among
the 
Britaines
 and 
Saxons.
 But most true it is, that in the Raigne of King 
Edward
 the third, vpon de∣bate
falling betwixt the Southerne and Northerne Students at 
Oxford,
 many Schoole-men with∣drew
themselues hither, and a while professed, and named a Colledge, according to one in 
Oxford,
Brasen-nose,
 which retaineth that name vnto this day. This was so great a skarre vnto the other,
that when they were recalled by Proclamation to 
Oxford,
 it was prouided by Oath, 
that no Stu∣dent
in Oxford should publikely professeor reade the Arts at Stanford, to the preiudice of Oxford.


(9) As this Shire is the least in circuit, so is it with the fewest Market-Townes replenished ha∣uing
onely two. And from Societies that seed vpon the labours of others, was this Land the freest:
for besides 
Rihall,
 where 
Tibba
 the 
F
lconers
 Goddesse was worshipped for a Saint, when Supersti∣tion
had well-neere put Gods true honour out of place, I finde very few; neither with more Castles
strengthened then that at 
Okham,
 whose ruines shew that a Castle hath beene there.


Diuided it is into fiue Hundreds, and therein are planted fortie eight Parish-Churches.













LEICESTER-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXX.


LEICESTER-SHIRE, lying bordered vpon the North with 
Nottingham-shire;
 vpon the
East, with 
Lincolne
 and 
Rutland;
 vpon the South with 
Northampton shire;
 and vpon the West
with 
Watling-street-way
 is parted from 
Warwick-shire;
 the rest being bounded with the con∣sines
of 
Darby,
 is a Country Champion, abounding in corne, but spary of woods, especially in
the South and East parts, which are supplyed with pit-coales plenteously gotten in the North
of this Prouince, and with abundance of Cattle bred in the hilles beyond the Riuer 
Wreak,
 which is
nothing so well inhabited as the rest.


(2) The Ayre is gentle, milde, and temperate, and giueth appetite both to labour and rest:
wholesome it is, and draweth mans life to a long age, and that much without sicknesse; at 
Carleton

onely some defect of pronunciation appeareth in their speech.


(3) The soile thus consisting, the commodities are raised accordingly of Corne, Cattle, and
Coales; and in the Rockes neere 
Beuer
 are sometimes found the 
Astroites,
 the Starre-like precious
Stone.


(4) The ancient people that inhabited this Countie, were the 
Coritani,
 who were spread further
into other Shires, but after that the 
Romans
 had left the Land to it selfe, this with many more fell
to be vnder the possession and gouernment of the 
Mercians,
 and their Kings, from whom the 
Eng∣lish

enioyeth it at this day.


(5) In Circular-wise (almost) the compasse of this Shire is drawne indifferently spacious, but
not very thicke of Inclosures, being from 
East
 to West in the broadest part not fully 30. miles, and


from North to South but 24. the whole circumference about 196. miles; whose principall Citie is
set, as the Center, almost in the midst; from whom the Pole is eleuated 53. degrees and 4 minutes
in Latitude, and for Longitude, 19. degrees, 22. minutes.


(6) From this Towne the Shire hath the name, though the name of her selfe is diuersly written,
as 
Legecestria, Legora, Legeo-cester:
 by 
Ninius, Caer-Lerion;
 by 
Mathew
 of 
Westminister
 (if we doe
not mistake him) 
Wirall;
 and now lastly, 
Leicester:
 ancient enough if King 
Leir
 was her builder,
eight hundred fortie and foure yeares before the birth of our Sauiour, wherein he placed a Flamine
to serue in the Temple of 
Ianus,
 by himselfe there erected, and where he was buried, if 
Ieffery ap Ar∣thur

say true: but now certaine it is, that 
Ethelred
 the 
Mercian
 Monarch made it an Episcopall See,
in the yeare of Christ Iesus 680. wherein 
Sexwulph
 of his election became the first Bishop: which
shortly after was thence translated, and therewith the beautie of the Towne began to decay; vpon
whose desolations that erectifying Lady 
Edelsted
 cast her eyes of compassion, and both reedified the
buildings, and compassed it about with a strong wall, where, in short time the Cities trade so increa∣sed,
that 
Matthew Paris
 in his lesser Story reporteth as followeth; 
Lege-cester
 (saith he) 
is a right
wealthy Citie, and notably defended; and had the wall a sure foundation, were inferiour to no Citie what∣soeuer.

But this pride of prosperitie long lasted not vnder the 
Normans,
 for it was sore oppressed with
a world of calamities, when 
Robert Bossu
 the Crouch-backe Earle of that 
Prouince,
 rebelled against
his Soueraigne Lord King 
Henry
 the second: whereof heare the same Author 
Paris
 speake: 
Through
the obstinate stubbornesse of Earle
 Robert (saith he) 
the noble Citie
 Leicester 
was besieged and throwne
downe by King
 Henry, 
and the wall that seemed indissoluble, was vtterly raced, euen to the ground.

The peeces of whose fragments so fallen downe, remained in his dayes like to hard rockes, through
the strength of the Morter cementing whole lumpes together: and at the Kings command the Citie
was set on fire and burnt, the Castle raced, and a heauit imposition laid vpon the Citizens, who with


great summes of money bought their owne Banishments: but were so vsed in their departure, that
for extreame feare many of them tooke Sanctuary, both at S. 
Edmunds
 and S. 
Albanes.
 In repen∣tance
of these mischiefes, the Author thereof, 
Earle Robert,
 built the Monastery of S. 
Mary de Prae∣tis,

wherein himselfe became a Canon regular, and for fifteene yeares continuance in sad laments
serued God in continuall prayers. With the like deuotion, 
Henry
 the first Duke of 
Lancaster
 built
an Hospitall for an hundred and ten poore people, with a Collegiate Church, a Deane, twelue Ca∣nons
Prebendaries, as many Vicars, sufficiently prouided for with reuenewes; wherein himselfe
lyeth buryed: and it was the greatest ornament of that Citie, vntil the hand of King 
Henry
 the 8.
lay ouer-heaiue vpon all the like foundations, and laid their aspired tops at his owne feete.


The fortunes of another 
Crouch-backe
 (King 
Richard
 the V
per) were no lesse remarkable in
this Citie then the former 
Robert
 was, both of them in like degree of dishonourable course of 
life,

though of disterent 
issue
 at their deaths, the one dying penitent and of deuout esteeme; the other
leauing the stench of Tyranny to all following ages; who from this Citie setting forth in one day
with great pompe, and in Battle aray, to keepe the Crowne sure vpon his owne Helmet, in a sore

 field, yeelded both it and his life, vnto the head and hands of 
Henry
 of 
Richmond
 his Con∣querour:
and the next day was brought backe, like a Hogge, naked and 
 and with contempt,
without teares 
 buried in the 
G
y-Fryers
 of this Citie; whose suppression hath suppressed
the plot place of his graue, and onely the stone-chest wherein he was laid (a drinking trough now
for horses in a common In
e) retaineth the memory of that great Monarchs Funerall: and so did
a stone in the Church and Chappell of S. 
Maries,
 inclose the corpse of the proud and pontificall
Cardinall 
Wolsey,
 who had prepared for himselfe, as was said, a farre more richer Monument.


(7) Otherplaces worthy of remembrance in this Shire were these: In the West, where a high
Crosse was erected, in former times stood the faire Citie 
Cleycester,
 the 
Romans
 BENONNES,


where their Legions lay, and where their two principall wayes crossed each other, as the Inhabi∣tants
report; 
Loughborrow
 in the North-verge, was (as 
Marianus
 affirmeth) taken from the 
Bri∣taines

by 
Cuthwolfe
 their King, about the yeare of 
Christ
 572.


At 
Redmore,
 neere 
Bosworth,
 Westward in this Countie, the Kingdome of 
England
 lay in hazard
of one Battle, when King 
Richards
 Field was fought, where the Land at once was freed from a Ty∣rant
and a wicked Vsurper. Neither may we passe 
Lutterworth,
 as the least in account, where the fa∣mous

Iohn Wickliffe, Englands
 Morning-starre, dispersed the clouds of all Papisticall darknesse, by
preaching the Gospell in that his charge; and stile of his pen, so piercing in power, that the man of
Sinne euer since hath beene better knowne to the world.


(8) Religious houses by Princes erected, and by them deuoted to God and his seruice, the chie∣fest
in this Shire were at 
Leicester, Grace-Dieu, Kerby Bellers,
 and at 
Burton
 a Spittle for 
Lazers,
 a dis∣ease
then newly approched in this Land; for the erection whereof a common contribution was ga∣thered
thorow the Realme: the Patients in this place were not so much deformed in skin, as the o∣ther
were in the defects for the soule; whose skirts being turned vp to the sight of the world, their
s
mes were discouered, and those houses dissolued, that had long maintained such Idolatrous
sinnes.


(9) This Shires diuision is into six Hundreds, and in them are seated twelue Market-Townes
for commerce, and containeth in her circuit two hundred Parish-Churches.













LINCOLN-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXXI.


THe County of 
Lincolne,
 by the 
Normans
 called 
Nicolshire,
 is consined on the North with 
Hum∣ber,

on the East with the 
German Ocean,
 vpon the South is parted from 
Cambridge
 and 
Nor∣thampton-shire

by the Riuer 
Nyne;
 and on the West from 
Nottingham
 and 
York-shires
 by 
Dun

and 
Trent.


(2) The length of this Prouince extended from 
Barton
 vpon 
Humber
 in the North, vnto

Stanford
 vpon the Riuer 
Nyne
 in the South, are miles by our 
English
 measure fiftie fiue, and the
bredth thereof from 
Newton
 in the West, stretched vnto 
Wintbory
 vpon her East Sea containeth thir∣tie
fiue. The whole in circumference about one hundred and eightie miles.


(3) The Ayre vpon the East and South part is both thicke and foggy, by reason of the Fennes
and vnsolute grounds, but therewithall very moderate and pleasing. Her graduation being remoued
from the Aequator to the degree of 53. and the windes that are sent of her still working Seas, doe
disperse those vapours from all power of hurt.


(4) The forme of this County doth somewhat resemble the body of a Lute, whose East coasts
lye bowe-like into the 
German Ocean,
 all along pestered with inlets of salt waters and sands, which
are neither firme nor safe for trauellers, as those in the South proued vnto King 
Iohn
 who mat∣ching
North-ward from 
Northfolke,
 against his disloyall Barons, vpon those washes 

and carriage by the sodaine returne of the Sea, and sofenesse of the sands.


(5) Her Soile vpon the West and North is abundantly 
, pleasant, 

pasturage, areable and meadowing grounds: the East and South fenny and 



barren; but for fowle and fish exceeding any other in the Realme; wherein, at some times and sea∣son
of the yeare, hath beene taken in nets, in 
August,
 at one draught, aboue three thousand Mallards,
and other Fowles of the like kinde.


(6) The Shires commodities consist chiefly in Corne, Cattle, Fish, Fowle, Flax and Alabla∣ster;
as also in a Plaister much esteemed of by the 
Romans
 for their workes of Imagery; and where∣of

Plinie
 in his 
Naturall History
 maketh mention. And the 
Astroites,
 a precious stone, Star-like, poin∣ted
with fiue beames or rayes, anciently esteemed for their vertue in victories, vpon the South-west
of this County neere 
Beuer
 are found: not farre thence in our Fathers memory, at 
Harlaxton
 was
ploughed vp a brasen vessell, wherein was inclosed a golden Helmet of an ancient fashion, set with
precious stones, which was presented to 
Kathren
 of 
Spaine,
 Wife and Dowager to King 
Henry
 the
eight▪


(7) This Shire triumpheth in the births of 
Beauclerke,
 King 
Henry
 the first, whom 
Selby
 brought
forth, and of King 
Henry
 the fourth, at 
Bullingbrooke
 borne: but may as iustly lament for the death
of King 
Iohn,
 herein poysoned by 
S
non
 a Monke of 
Swynsted Abbey;
 and of Queene 
Eleanor,
 wife
to King 
Edward
 the first, the mirrour of wedlocke, and loue to the Commons, who at 
Hardby,
 neere

Bullingbrooke,
 his birth place, ended her life.


(8) Trade and commerce for prouision of life is vented thorow thirtie one Market-Townes
in this Shire, whereof 
Lincolne
 the Counties namer is chiefe, by 
Ptolemie
 and 
Antonine
 called 
Lin∣dum,

by 
Beda Linde-collma,
 and by the 
Normans, Nichol.
 Very ancient it is, and hath beene more mag∣nificall,
as by her many ouerturned ruines doth appeare, and farre more populous, as by 
Demesdayes

Booke is seene, where it is recorded that this Citie contained a thousand and seauen Mansions, and
nine hundred Burgesses, with twelue Lage-men, hauing Sac and Soc. And in the 
Normans
 time, saith

Malmesbury,
 it was one of the best peopled Cities of 
England,
 being a place for trafficke of Merchan∣dize


for all commerce by Land or Sea. Herein King 
Edward
 the third ordained his Staple for the
Mart of Wools, Leather, and Lead; and no lesse then fiftie Parish. Churches did beautifie the same:
but now containeth onely fifteene besides the Cathedrall. Some ruines yet remaines both of 
Frie∣ries

and 
Nunneries,
 who lye now buried in their owne ashes, and the Citie conquered not by warre,
but by time and very age: and yet hath she not escaped the calamitie of sword, as in the time of the

Saxons;
 whence 
Arthur
 enforced their Host: the like also did 
Edmund
 to the destroying 
Danes;
 and
by the 
Normans
 it suffered some dammage, where King 
Stephen
 was vanquished and taken prisoner;
and againe, by the third 
Henry,
 that assaulted and wan it from his rebellious 
Barons.
 By fire likewise
it was fore defaced, wherein not onely the buildings were consumed, but withall many men and wo∣men
in the violence thereof perished: as also by an Earth-quake her foundation was much weake∣ned
and shaken, wherein the faire Cathedrall Church, dedicated to the Virgin of Virgins, was rent
in peeces. The gouernment of this Citie is committed yearely to a Maior, tow Sheriffes, twelue
Aldermen in Scarlet, a Sword, a Hat of Estate, a Recorder, Sword-bearer, and foure Sergeants with
Maces: whose situation on a sleepe hill standeth, for Longitude in the degree 20. 10. scruples, the
Pole eleuated for Latitude from the degree 53. and 50. scruples.


(9) 
Much hath beene the deuotion of Princes in building religious houses in this Countie, as
at
 Crowland, Lincolne, Markeby, Leyborne, Grenfeld, Aluingham, Newnersby, Grymmysby, Newsted, El∣sham,
Stay
feld, Syxhyll, Torkesey, Bryggerd, Thorneholme, Nuncotton, Fosse, Heyings, Axholme Ile,
Goykewell, 
S.
 Michaels 
neere
 Stamford, Swyn
shead, Spalding, Kirkested, &c.


(10) Commotions in this Shire were raysed the eight and twentieth of King 
Henry
 the Eight,
where twentie thousand making insurrection, violently sware certaine Lords and Gentlemen to
their Articles. But no sooner they heard of the Kings power comming, but that they dispersed them∣selues,


and sued for pardon. And againe in the third yeare of King 
Edward
 the Sixt, in case of In∣closu
es,

Lincolne,
 rose in seditious manner, as did they of 
Cornwall, Deuon-shire, York-shire,
 and 
Nor∣folke:

but after some flaughters of their chiefest men, were reduced to former obedience.


The Shires diuision is into three principall par
, viz. 
Lindsey, Kesteuen,
 and 
Holland, Lindsey
 is
subdiuided into seauenteene Hundreds, 
 into eleuen, and 
Holland
 into three, containing in
all thirtie one, wherein are situated thirtie Market-Townes, and sixe hundred thirty Parish-Chur∣ches.













NOTTINGHAM-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXXII.


NOTTINGHAM-SHIRE (from 
Nottingham
 her chiefest Towne hath the name; and
that, somewhat softned from the 
Saxons
 Snoddenzaham, for the many Dennes or Caues
wrought in her Rocks and vnder ground) lyeth bordered vpon the North & North west
with 
York-shire;
 vpon the East a good distance by 
Trent
 is parted froM, and with 
Lincoln-shire

altogether confined: the South with 
Leicester-shire;
 and the West by the Riuer 
Erwash

is seperated from 
Darby-shire.


(2) For forme long and Ouall-wise, doubling in length twice her bredth, whose extreames
are thus extended and distance obserued: From 
Finingley
 North to 
Sleanford
 in the South, are thir∣tie
eight 
English
 miles; her West part from 
Teuersall
 to 
Besthorp
 in the East, are little more then nine∣teene;
whose circumference draweth much vpon one hundred and ten miles.


(3) The Ayre is good, wholesome and delectable: the Soile is rich, sandy and clayie, as by the
names of that Counties diuisions may appeare: and surely for Corne and Grasse so fruitfull, that it
secondeth any other in the Realme: and for Water, Woods, and Canell Coales abundantly sto∣red.


(4) Therein groweth a Stone softer then 
Alablaster,
 but being burnt maketh a plaister harder
then that of 
Paris:
 wherewith they flower their vpper roomes; for betwixt the Ioysts they lay one∣ly
long Bulrushes, and thereon spread this Plaister, which being throughly dry becomes most solide
and hard, so that it seemeth rather to be firme stone then mortar, and is trod vpon without all dan∣ger.



In the West neere 
Worksop
 groweth plentie of 
Liquorice,
 very delicious and good.


(5) More South in this Shire, at 
Stoke,
 in the Raigne of King 
Henry
 the seauenth, a great battle
was fought by 
Iohn De-la-Pole
 Earle of 
Lincolne,
 which 
Richard
 the Vsurper had declared his heire ap∣parant;
but 
Richard
 losing his life, and 
De-la Pole
 his hopes, in seeking here to set vp a 
Lambert,
 fell
downe himselfe: and at 
Newarke
 after many troubles King 
Iohn
 got his peace with the end of his
life.


(6) Trade and commerce for the Counties prouision is frequented in eight Market-Townes
in this Shire, whereof 
Nottingham
 is both the greatest and best: a Towne seated most pleasant and
delicate vpon a high hill, for buildings stately, and number of faire streets, surpassing and surmoun∣ting
many other Cities, and for a spacious and most faire Market-place, doth compare with the
best Many strange Vaults hewed out of the Rockes, in this Towne are seene; and those vnder the
Castle of an especiall note, one for the story of 
Christs
 Passion engrauen in the Walls, and cut by the
hand of 
Dauid
 the second King of 
Scots,
 whilst he was therein detained prisoner. Another wherein
Lord 
Mortimer
 was surprised in the non-age of King 
Edward
 the Third, euer since beating the
name of 
Mortimers Hole;
 these haue their staires and seuerall roomes made artifically euen out of the
Rockes: as also in that hill are dwelling houses, with winding staires, windowes, chimneys, and
roome aboue roome, wrought all out of the solide Rocke. The Castle is strong, and was kept by
the 
Danes
 against 
Burthred, Ethelred,
 and 
Elfred,
 the 
Mercian,
 and 
West-Saxon
 Kings, who together
laid their siege against it: and for the further strength of the Towne, King 
Edward,
 surnamed the
Elder, walled it about, whereof some part as yet remaines, from the Castle to the West-gate, and
thence the foundation may be perceiued to the North; where in the midst of the way ranging with
this banke, stands a gate of Stone, and the same tract passing along the North part may well be


perceiued: the rest to the Riuer, and thence to the Castle are built vpon, and thereby buried from
sight: whose circuit, as I tooke it, extendeth two thousand one hundred and twentie pases.


(7) In the Warres betwixt 
Stephen
 and 
Maud
 the Empresse, by 
Robert
 Earle of 
Glocester
 these
Wells were east downe, when also the Towne it selfe suffered the calamitie of fire: but recouered
to her former estate, hath since increased in beautie and wealth, and at this day is gouerned by a
Maior and sixe Aldermen, clad in Scarlet, two Sheriffes, two Chamberlaines, a Towne-clerke, and
sixe Sergeants with Maces, their Attenders: whose position hath the Pole eleuated fiftie three de∣grees.
25. minutes in Latitude, and hath the Meridian nine degrees and 25. minutes. This Towne
hath beene honoured by these Princes titles, and these Princes dignified with the Earledome of

Nottingham,
 whose seuerall Armes and Names are in the great 
Map
 expressed.


Religious houses that haue beene erected and now suppressed in the compasse of this Countie,
chiefly were 
Newsted, Lenton, Shelford, Southwell, Thurgarton, Blith, Welbeck
 and 
Radford;
 in 
Notting∣ham

the 
White
 and 
Gray Fryers,
 besides a little Chappell dedicated to Saint 
Iohn.
 All which shew
the deuotions of those former times: which their remembrance may moue, if not condemne vs, that
haue more knowledge, but farre lesse pietie.


The Shires diuision is principally into two: which the Inhabitants terme the Sand and the Clay;
but for Tax
 to the Crowne, or seruice for State, is parted into eight Wapentakes or Hundreds,
wherein are seated 168. Parish Churches.













DARBY-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXXIII.


DARBY-SHIRE, lyeth inclosed vpon her 
North
 parts with 
Yorke-shire;
 vpon the 
East
 with

Nottingham-shire;
 vpon the 
South
 with 
Leicester-shire;
 and vpon the 
West
 is parted with the
Riuers 
Doue
 and 
Goyt
 from 
Stafford
 and 
Chesse-shires.


(2) It is in forme somewhat triangle, though not of any equall distance, growing from
her narrow South-point still wider, and in the North is at the broadest: for from 
Stretton

neere the head of 
Mese,
 to 
New-Chapell
 seated neere the head of 
Derwent,
 the two extreames from
North to South are thirtie eight miles: but from the 
Shire-Oakes
 vnto the meeting of 
Mersey
 and

Goyt,
 the broadest part of all this Shire, is not fully twentie nine; the whole in circumference ex∣tendeth
to an hundred and thirtie miles.


(3) The ayre is good and very healthfull: the sile is rich, especially in her South and East
parts: but in the North and West is hilly, with a blacke and mossie ground, both of them fast han∣ded,
to the 
Ploughers
 paines, though very liberall in her other gifts: whose natures thus dissenting,
the Riuer 
Derwent
 doth diuide asunder, that taketh course thorow the heart or midst of this Coun∣tie.


The ancient people that possessed these parts in the times of the 
Romans
 assaults, were the

Coritani,
 whom 
Ptolemie
 disperseth thorow 
Northampton-shire, Leicester, Rutland, Lincolne, Nottingham,

and this Shire, who were all of them subdued by 
P. Ostorius Scapula,
 Lieutenant in this Prouince
for 
Claudius
 the Emperour. But 
Romes
 Empire failing in 
Britaine,
 by the intestine Warres among
themselues, the 
Saxons
 (a more sauage and fearefull Nation) soone brought it vnder their sub∣iection,


and made this a Prouince vnto their 
Mercians
 Kingdome, whom the 
West-Saxons
 first wanne
and againe lost to the 
Normans.


(5) It is stored with many Commodities, and them of much worth; for besides Woods and
Cattle, Sheepe and Corne, euery where ouer-spreading the face of this Countie, the 
Mill-stone, Cry∣stall,

and 
Allablas
er,
 the Mines of 
Pit-coale, Iron,
 and 
Lead,
 are of great price: whereof the last is
mentioned in 
Flinie,
 who writeth that 
in Britaine, in the very crust of the ground, without any deepe
digging, is gotten so great store of Lead, that there is a Law expresly made of purpose, forbidding men to make
more then to a certaine stint.
 Whose stones are plenteously gotten in those Mountaines, and melted
into 
Sowes,
 to no small profit of the Countrey. There is found also in certaine veines of the earth,

Subium
 which the 
Apothecarits
 call 
Antimonium,
 and the 
Al
thmists
 hold in great esteeme.


(6) Places for commerce, or memorable note, the first is 
Darby,
 the 
Shire-Towne,
 called by the

Danes De
aby,
 seated vpon the West banke of 
Derwent,
 where also a small Brooke rising Westward,
runneth thorow the Towne vnder nine Bridges, before it meets with her farre greater Riuer 
Der∣went,

which presently it doth, after she hath passed 
Tenant Bridge
 in the South-East of the Towne.
But a Bridge of more beautie, built all of 
Free-stone,
 is passed ouer 
Derwent
 in the North-East of the
Towne, whereon standeth a faire stone Chapell, and both of them bearing the names of S. 
Maries:

fiue other Churches are in this Towne, the chiefest whereof is called 
A
hallowes,
 whose Steeple or
Bell-Tower being both beautifull and high, was built onely at the charges of young men and maids,
as is witnessed by the inscription cut in the same vpon euery square of the Steeple. Among the mise∣rable
desolations of the 
Danes,
 this Towne bare a part, but by Lady 
Ethelfleda
 was againe repaired,
and is at this day in
orporated with the yearely gournment of two 
Bailiffes,
 elect out of twentie-foure
brethren, besides as many 
Burgesses
 of Common Counsell, a 
Recorder, Towne-Clerke,
 and two

Sergeants
 with 
Mace:
 whose Graduation is obserued from the 
Equator
 to be 53. degrees 25. scru∣ples,
and from the first point in the West, 19. degrees 2. scruples.



(7) 
Little-Chester
 (by the 
Romish Mony
 there daily found) seemeth to haue beene ancient, and
that a 
Colonie
 of the 
Roman Souldiers
 there lay. Yet of farre greater fame was 
Repandunum,
 now 
Repton,

where 
Ethelbald
 the ninth King of the 
Mercians,
 and fifteenth Monarch of the 
Englishmen,
 slaine at

Seggeswald
 by the treason of his Subiects, was interred: and whence 
Burthred,
 the last King of that
people, was expulsed with his Queene 
Ethelswith,
 by the rage of the 
Danes,
 after twentie two yeares
raigne. But with a more pleasing eye we may behold 
Melborne,
 the memoriall of 
Englishmens
 great
valour, where in that Castle was kept Prisoner 
Iohn
 Duke of 
Burbon,
 taken captiue in the Battle of

Agincourt,
 and therein detained the space of nineteene yeares.


(8) Things of stranger note are the hot Water-springs, bursting forth of the ground at 
Buxton,

where out of the Rocke within the compasse of eight yards, nine springs arise, eight of them warme,
but the ninth very cold. These run from vnder a faire square building of free-stones, and about three-score
paces off, receiue another hot spring from a Well, inclosed with foure flat stones, called Saint

Annes;
 neere vnto which, another very cold spring bubled vp. The report goeth among the by∣dwellers,
that great cures by these waters haue beene done: but daily experience sheweth, that they
are good for the stomacke and sinewes, and very pleasant to bathe the body in. Not farre thence
is 
Elden hole,
 whereof strange things haue beene told, and this is confidently affirmed, the waters that
trickle from the top of that Caue (which indeed is very spacious, but of a low and narrow entrance)
doe congeale into stone, and hang as ickles in the roofe. Some of them were shewed at my being
there, which like vnto such as the frost congealeth, were hollow within, and grew Taper-wise to∣wards
their points, very white, and somewhat Crystall-like. And seauen miles thence, vpon a moun∣ted
hill, standeth a Castle, vnder which there is a hole or Caue in the ground of a marueilous capa∣citie,
which is commonly called 
The Deuils Arse in the Peake,
 whereof 
Geruase
 of 
Tilbury
 hath told
many pretie tales, and others doe make it one of the wonders of our Land.



(9) As in other Counties the deuotions of the religious haue beene made apparent in the erecti∣on
of places for Gods peculiar seruice; so in this haue beene founded eight of that nature, which
were 
Dale, Detelege, Darby, Rep
on, Bechif, Grai
sley, Fauerwell,
 and 
Pollewerke:
 whose peace and plen∣tie
stood secure from all danger, till the blustering windes arising in the Raigne of King 
Henry
 the
eight, blew off the pinacles of their beauteous buildings, and shooke asunder the reuenewes of those
Foundations which neuer are like againe to be laid.


(10) This Shire is diuided into sixe Hundreds, wherein haue beene seated seauen Castles, and
is still traded with eight Market-Townes, and replenished with one Hundred and sixe Parish-Chur∣ches.













STAFFORD-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXXIIII.


STAFFORD-SHIRE, whose situation is much about the middle of 
England,
 meeteth vpon
the North with 
Chesse-shire
 and 
Darby,
 and that in a Triangle point, where three stones are
pitched for the bounds of these Shires; it is parted from 
Darby shire
 on the East with 
Dowe

and with 
Trent;
 the South is confined with 
Warwicke
 and 
Worcester-shires,
 and the West butteth
against the Countie of 
Shrop-shire.


The forme thereof is somewhat Lozeng-like, that is, sharpe at both ends, and broadest in
the midst. The length extending from North to South, is by measure fortie foure miles; and the
bredth from East to West, twenty seauen miles; the whole in circumference one hundred and fortie
miles.


(3) The ayre is good and very healthfull, though ouer-sharpe in her North and 
Moreland,
 where
the snow lyeth long, and the winde bloweth cold.


(4) The Soile in that part is barren of Corne, because her hilles and Mores are no friends vn∣to
Tillage: the middle is more leuell, but therewithall wooddie, as well witnesseth that great one,
called the 
Cank.
 But the South is most plenteous in Corne and Pasturage.


(5) Her ancient Inhabitants were the CORNAVII, whom 
Ptolemie
 placeth in the Tract that
containeth 
Shrop-shire, Worcester-shire, Chesse-shire,
 and this: all which were possessed by the 
Mercian-Saxons

when their 
Heptarchy
 flourished. And 
Tameworth
 in this Shire was then held their Kings
Court. The 
Danes
 after them often aflayed herein to haue seated, as witnesseth 
Ternall,
 then 
Th
∣tenhall,

by interpretation, 
The habitation of Pagans,
 
brued with their bloud by King 
Edward
 the el∣der.


But the Inhabitants of this Prouince 
Beda
 tearmes 
The midland Englishmen,
 because to his see∣ming
it lay in the heart of the Land, which when the 
Normans
 had made Conquest of all, many of
them set downe their rest here, whose posteritie at this day are fairely and further branched into
other parts.


(6) The Commodities of this Countie consist chiefly in Corne, Cattle, Alablaster, Woods,
and Iron, (if the one proue not the destruction of the other) Pit-coale, Flesh and Fish, whereof the
Riuer 
Trent
 is said to swarme: and others arising and running thorow this Shire, doe so batten the
ground, that the Meadowes euen in the midst of Winter grow greene; such are 
Dowe, Manifold,
Churnot, Hunsye, Yenden, Tean, Elith, Trent. Tyne,
 and 
Sowe;
 whereof 
Trent
 is not onely the princi∣pall,
but in esteeme accounted the third of this Land.


(7) 
Stafford
 the Snire-Towne, anciently 
Betheney,
 from 
Bertelin,
 a reputed holy man that therein
lead an 
Hermits
 life, was built by King 
Edward
 the elder, incorporated by King 
Iohn,
 and vpon the
East and South parts was walled and trenched by the 
Barons
 of the place; the rest from East to North
was secured by a large Poole of water, which now is become faire Meadow grounds. The tract
and circuit of these welles extended to twelue hundred and fortie pases, thorow which foure Gates
into the foure winds haue passage, the Riuer 
Sowe
 running on the South and West of the Towne.
King 
Edward
 the sixt did incorporate the 
Burgesses,
 and gaue them a perpetuall succession, whose
gouernment is vnder two 
Bailiffes
 yearely elected out of one and twentie Assistants, called the 
Com∣mon
Counsell,
 a 
Recorder,
 whereof the Dukes of 
Buckingham
 haue borne the Office, and as yet is kept
a Court of Record, wherein they hold Plea without limitation of summe; a 
Towne-Clerke
 also,
(from whose Pen I receiued these Instructions) and to attend them two 
Sergeants
 at Mace. This
Towne is sited in the degree of Latitude 53. 20. scruples, and of Longitude 18. and 40. scru∣ples.



(8) But 
Leichfield,
 more large, and of farre greater same, is much her ancient, knowne vnto

Beda
 by the name of 
Licidfeld,
 which 
Rosse
 doth interpret to be 
The field of deadbodies,
 for the num∣ber
of Saints vnder the rage of 
Dioclesia
 there slaine: vpon which cause the Citie beareth for her
Armes an Eschocheon of 
Landskip,
 with diuers Martyrs in diuers manner massacred. Here 
Oswin

King of 
Northumberland
 ouer-comming the 
Pagan-Mercians,
 built a Church and made it the See
of 
Duina
 the Bishop; whose successors growne rich, with golden reasons so ouercame King 
Offa,

and the 
Adrian
 the 
Pope,
 that an Archiepiscopall Pale was granted Bishop 
Eadulph,
 to the great dis∣grace
of 
Lambert
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury.
 In this Church were interred the bodies of 
Wulshere

and 
Celred,
 both of them Kings of the 
Mercians.
 But when the mindes of men were set altogether
vpon gorgeous building, this old foundation was new reared by 
Roger Clinton,
 Bishop of this See,
and dedicated to the 
Virgin Mary
 and 
Saint Chad,
 and the Close inwalled by 
Bishop Langton.
 The
gouernment of this Citie is by two 
Bailiffes
 and one 
Sheriffe,
 yearely chosen out of twentie-foure

Burgesses,
 a 
Recorder,
 a 
Towne-Clerke,
 and two 
Sergeants
 their Attendants.


(9) Houses of Religion erected in this Shire, were at 
Leichfield, Stafford, De la Crosse, Cru
den,
Trentham, Burton, Tamworth,
 and 
Woluer-hampt
n.
 These Votaries abusing their Founders true pie∣ties,
and heaping vp riches with disdaine of the Laitie, laid themselues open as markes to be shot at;
whom the hand of the skilfull soone hit and quite pierced, vnder the ayme of King 
Henry
 the eight,
who with such Reuenewes in most places relieued the poore and the Orphane, with Schooles and
maintenance for the training vp of youth: a worke no doubt more acceptable to God, and of more
charitable vse to the Land.


(10) With 13. Castles this Countie hath beene strengthned, and 
 Market-Townes
her Commodities traded, being diuided into fiue Hundreds, and 
 one hundred and
thirtie Parish-Churches.













SHROP-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXXV.


SHROP-SHIRE, is both large incircuit, well peopled, and very fruitfull for life. It lieth circu∣lated
vpon the North with the County Palatine of 
Chester;
 vpon the East altogether with 
Staf∣ford-shire;

vpon the South with 
Worcester, Hereford,
 and 
Raduor-shires;
 and vpon the West with

Mountgomery
 and 
Denbigh.


(2) The forme thereof is almost ciruclar or round, whose length from 
Weo
erto
 below 
od∣lane
South,
 to 
Ouer
 neere vnto the Riuer 
Trent
 in the North, is thirtie foure miles: the broadest part
is from 
Tong
 in the East, to 
Oswestre
 sited at the head of 
Morda
 in the West, twentie and fiue miles;
the whole in circuit about, extending to one hundred thirtie and foure miles.


(3) Wholesome is the Aire, delectable and good, yeelding the Spring and the Autmne Seede
time and Haruest, in a temperate condition, and affoordeth health to the Inhabitants in all seasons
of the yeare.


(4) The soile is rich, and standeth most vpon a reddish Clay, abounding in Wheat and Barley,
Pit-coales, Iron, and Woods; which two last continue not long in league together. It hath Riuers
that make fruitfull the Land, and in their waters containe great store of fresh-fish, whereof 
Seuer
e

is the chiefe, and second in the Realme, whose streame cutteth this Countie in the middest, and
with many windings sporteth her selfe forward, leauing both pastures and meadowes be
ed with
flowers and greene colours, which euery where she bestoweth vpon such her attendants.


(5) This Riuer was once the bounds of the 
North-Britaines,
 and diuided their possession from
the Land of the 
Saxons,
 vntill of latter times theirs began to decay, and the 
Welsh
 to increase, who


enlarged their lists to the Riuer 
Dee.
 So formerly had it separated the 
Ordouices
 from the 
Cornauji,

those ancient Inhabitants mentioned by 
Ptolemie.
 The 
Ordouices
 vnder 
Caractachus
 purchased great
honour, whilest he a Prince of the 
Silures
 remoued his warres thence among them, where a while
he maintained the 
Britaines
 libertie with valour and courage, in despight of the 
Romans.
 His Fort is
yet witnesse of his vnfortunate fight, seated neere 
Clune Castle,
 at the confluence of that Riuer with

Temd,
 where (in remembrance of him) the place is yet called 
Caer-Caradoc,
 a Fort of his, wonne by

P. Ostorius
 Lieutenant of the 
Romans,
 about the yeare of grace 53. The 
Cornauji
 were feared vpon
the North of 
Scuerne,
 and branched into other Counties, of whom we haue said.


(6) But when the strength of the 
Romans
 was too weake to support their owne Empire, and 
Bri∣taine

emptied of her Souldiers to resist, the 
Saxons
 set foot in this most faire soile, and made it a part
of their 
Mercian Kingdome:
 their line likewise issued to the last period, and the 
Normans
 beginning
where these 
Saxons
 left, the 
Welshmen
 tooke aduantage of all present occasions, and brake ouer 
Se∣uerne

vnto the Riuer 
Dee;
 to recouer which, the 
Normans
 first Kings often affayed, and 
Henry
 the
second with such danger of life, that at the siege of 
Bridge-north
 he had beene slaine, had not Sir

H
bert Syncler
 receiued the arrow aimed at him, in stepping betwixt that Shaft and his Soueraigne,
and therewith was shot thorow vnto death. In the like danger stood 
Henry
 Prince of 
Scotland,
 who
in the strait siege of 
Ludlow,
 begirt by King 
Stephen,
 had beene plucked from his saddle with an iron
hooke from the wall, had not 
Stephen
 presently rescued him, 
Anno
 1139.


(7) This then being the 
Marches
 of 
England
 and 
Wales,
 was sore afflicted by bloudy broiles,
which caused many of their Townes to be strongly walled, and thirtie two Castles to be strongly
built: lastly, into this Countie the most wise King 
Henry
 the seauenth sent his eldest sonne Prince

Arthur,
 to be resident at 
Ludlow,
 where that faire Castle became a most famous Princes Court.
And here King 
Henry
 the eight ordained the Counsell of the 
Marches,
 consisting of a Lord Presi∣dent,


as many Counsellers as the Prince shall please, a Secretary, an Atturney, a Soliciter, and
foure Iustices of the Counties in 
Wales,
 in whose Court were pleaded the causes depending and
tearmely tried for the most part in presence of that honourable President.


(8) But the Shire-Towne 
Shrewesburie,
 for circuit, trade, and wealth, doth farre exceed this,
and is inferiour to few of our Cities; her buildings faire, her streets many and large, her Citizens
rich, her trade for the most part in the staple commodities of Cloth and Freeses; her wals strong,
and of a large compasse, extending to seauenteene hundred pases about, besides another Bulwarke
ranging from the Castle, downe vnto, and in part along the side of 
Seuerne:
 thorow which there are
three entrances into the Towne, East & West ouer by two faire stone-bridges with Towers, Gates,
and Barres, and the third into the North, no lesse strong then them, ouer which is mounted a large
Castle, whose gaping chinkes doe doubtlesse threaten her fall. This Towne is gouerned by two
Bailiffes, yearely elected out of twentie-foure Burgesses, a Recorder, Towne-Clerke, and Cham∣berlaine,
with three Sergeants at Mace: the Pole being raised hence from the degrees of Latitude
53. 16. minutes, and from West in Longitude 17. degrees 27. minutes.


(9) Yea, and ancienter Cities haue beene set in this Shire: such was 
Roxalter,
 or 
Wroxcester,
 low∣er
vpon 
Seuerne,
 that had beene 
Vricomum
 the chiefest Citie of the 
Cornauij; Vsoconia,
 now 
Okenyate,

neere vnto the 
Wrekin:
 and vnder 
Red-Castle
 the ruines of a Citie, whom the vulgar report to haue
beene famous in 
Arthurs
 dayes: but the peeces of 
Romish Coines
 in these three doe well assure vs that
therein their Legions lodged; as many other Trenches are signes of warre and of bloud. But as
swords haue beene stirring in most parts of this Prouince, so Beads haue beene bid for the preser∣uation
of the whole, and places erected for the maintenance of Votaries, in whom at that time was
imputed great holinesse: in 
Shrewesbury
 many, at 
Cou
ere, Stowe, Dudley, Bromefeld, Wigmore, Ha∣mond,


Lyleshill, Bildas, Bishops-castle,
 and 
Wenloke,
 (where in the Raigne of 
Richard
 the second; was
likewise a rich Mine of Copper.) But the same blasts that blew downe the buds of such plants,
scattered also the fruits from these faire trees, which neuer since bare the like, nor is likely any more
to doe.


That onely which is rare in this Prouince, is a Well at 
Pichford
 in a priuate mans yard, where∣upon
floteth a thicke skum of liquid 
Bitumen,
 which being cleare off to day, will gather the like a∣gaine
on the morrw: not much vnlike to the Lake in the Land of 
Iewry.


This Shire is diuided into fifteene Hundreds, wherein are seated foureteene Market-Townes;
and hath in it one hundred and seauentie Churches for Gods sacred and diuine Seruice.













The Countie Palatine of CHESTER.
CHAPTER XXXVI.


CHESSE-SHIRE; the Countie 
Palatine
 of 
Chester,
 is parted vpon the North from 
Lanca-shire

with the Riuer 
Mercy;
 vpon the East by 
Mercey, Goit,
 and the 
Dane,
 is separated from

Darby
 and 
Stafford-shires;
 vpon the South toucheth the Counties of 
Shrop-shire
 and 
Flint;

and vpon the West with 
Dee
 is parted from 
Denbigh shire.


(2) The forme of this Countie doth much resemble the right wing of an 
Eagle,
 spreading
it selfe from 
Wirall,
 and as it were with her pinion, or first feather, toucheth 
Yorke shire,
 betwixt
which extreames, in following the windings of the Shires diuder from East to West, are 47. miles:
and from North to South twentie-sixe miles. The whole circumference about one hundred fortie
two miles.


(3) If the affection to my naturall producer blind not the judgement of this my suruey, for aire
and soile it equale the best, and farre exceeds her neighbours the next Counties: for although the
Climate be cold, and toucheth the degree of Latitude 54. yet the warmth from the 
Irish Seas
 mel∣teth
the Snow, and dissolueth the Ice sooner there then in those parts that are further off; and so
wholesome for life, that the Inhabitants generally attaine to many yeares.


(4) The Soile is fat, fruitfull, and rich, yeelding abundantly both profit and pleasures for man.
The Champion grounds make glad the hearts of their Tillers: the Meadowes imbrodered with
diuers sweet smelling flowers; and the Pasture makes the Kines vdders to strout to the paile, from
whom and wherein the best 
Cheese
 of all 
Europe
 is made.


(5) The ancient Inhabitants were the CORNAVII, who with 
Warwicke-shire, Worcester-shire,


Stafford-shire,
 and 
Shrop-shire,
 spread themselues further into this Countie, as in 
Ptolemie
 is placed;
and the 
Cangi
 likewise if they be the 
Ceangi,
 whose remembrance was found vpon the shore of this
Shire, on the surface of certaine pieces of Lead, in this manner inscribed; IMP. DOMIT. AVO.
GER. DE CEANG. These 
Cangi
 were subdued by 
P. Ostorius Seapula,
 immediately before his
great victory against 
Caractacus,
 where, in the mouth of 
Deua
 he built a 
Fortresse
 at the backe of the

Ordouices,
 to restraine their power, which was great in those parts, in the raigne of 
Vespasian
 the
Emperour. But after the departure of the 
Romanes,
 this Prouince became a portion of the 
Saxon
Mercians
 Kingdome: notwithstanding (saith 
Ran Higden)
 the Citie it selfe was hold by the 
Britaines

vntill all fell into the Monarchy of 
Egbert.


Of the dispositions of the since Inhabitants heare
 Lucian 
the
 Monke 
(who liued presently after the
Conquest) spake;
 They are found 
(saith he)
 to differ from the rest of the English, partly better, and
partly equall. In feasting they are friendly, at meat chearefull, in entertainement liberall, soone angry, and
soone pacified, lauish in words, impatient of seruitude, mercifull to the afflicted, compassionate to the poore,
kinde to their kindred, spary of labour, void of disimulation, not greedie meating, and far from dangerous
practises.


And let me adde thus much, which 
Lucian
 could not; namely, that this Shire hath neuer beene
stained with the blot of rebellion, but euer stood true to their King and his Crowne: whose loyal∣tie

Richard
 the second so farre found and esteemed, that he held his person most safe among them,
and by authoritie of Parliament made the Countie to be a 
Principalitie,
 and stiled himselfe 
Prince of
Chester.


King 
Henry
 the third gaue it to his eldest sonne Prince 
Edward,
 against whom 
Lewlyn
 Prince of

Wales
 gathered a mightie Band, and with them did the Conntie much harme, euen vnto the Cities
gates. With the like scarre-fires it had oft times beene affrighted, which they lastly defenced with


a Wall made of the 
Welsh-mens
 heads, on the South side of 
Dee
 in 
Hanbridge.


The Shire may well be said to be a 
Seed-plot of Gentilitie,
 and the producer of many most ancient
and worthy Families: neither hath any brought more men of valour into the 
Field,
 then 
Chesse-shire

hath done, who by a generall speech, are to this day called 
The Chiefe of men:
 and for 
Natures
 endow∣ments
(besides their noblenesse of mindes) may compare with any other Nation in the world:
their limmes straight and well-composed, their complexions faire, with a chearefull countenance;
and the Women for grace, feature, and beautie, inferiour vnto none.


(6) The Commodities of this Prouince (by the report of 
Ranulphus
 the Monke of 
Chester)
 are
chiefly 
Corne, Cattle, Fish, Fowle, Salt, Mines, Metals, Meares,
 and 
Riuers,
 whereof the bankes of 
Dee

in her West, and the 
Vale Royall
 in her midst, for fruitfulnesse of pasturage equals any other in the
Land, either in graine from the Cow.


(7) These, with all other prouision for life, are traded thorow thirteene Market-Townes in this
Shire, whereof 
Chester
 is the fairest, from whom the Shire hath the name. A Citie raised from the
Fort of 
Ostorius,
 Lieutenant of 
Britaine
 for 
Claudius
 the Emperour, whither the twentieth Legion
(named 
Victrix)
 were sent by 
Galba
 to restraine the 
Britaines:
 but growne themselues out of order,

Iulius Agricola
 was appointed their Generall by 
Vespafian,
 as appeareth by Monies then minted, and
there found; and from them (no doubt) by the 
Britaines
 the place was called 
Caer Legion,
 by 
Ptole∣mie,
Deunana;
 by 
Antonine, Dena;
 and now by vs 
West-Chester:
 but 
Henry Bradshawe
 will haue it built
before 
Brute,
 by the Giant 
Leon Gaue
,
 a man beyond the Moone, and called by 
Marius
 the van∣quisher
of the 
Picts.


Ouer 
Deua
 or 
Dee
 a faire stone-bridge leadeth, built vpon eight Arches, at either end whereof
is a Gate, from whence in a long Quadren-wise the wals do incompasse the Citie, high and strong∣ly
built, with foure faire Gates, opening into the foure windes, besides three Posternes, and seauen


Watch-Towers, extending in compasse one thousand nine hundred and fortie paces.


On the South of this Citie is mounted a strong and stately Castle, round in forme, and the base
Court likewise inclosed with a circular wall. In the North is the Minister, first built by Earle 
Leofrike

to the honour of S. 
Werburga
 the Virgin, and after most sumptuously repaired by 
Hugh
 the first Earle
of 
Chester
 of the 
Normans,
 now the Cathedrall of the Bishops See. Therein lyeth interred (as report
doth relate) the body of 
Henry
 the fourth, Emperour of 
Almane,
 who leauing his Imperiall Estate,
lead lastly therein an 
Hermites
 life.


This Citie hath formerly beene sore defaced; first by 
Egfrid
 King of 
Northumberland,
 where he
slew twelue hundred Christian Monkes, resorted thither from 
Bangor
 to pray. Againe by the 
Danes

it was sore defaced, when their destroying feete had trampled downe the beautie of the Land. But
was againe rebuilt by 
Edelfleada
 the 
Mercian Lady,
 who in this Countie, and Forrest of 
Delamer,

built two fine Cities, nothing of them now remaining, besides the 
Chamber
 in the 
Forrest.


Chester
 in the dayes of King 
Edgar
 was in most flourishing estate, wherein he had the homage of
eight other Kings, who rowed his 
Barge
 from S. 
Iohns
 to his Pallace, himselfe holding the Helme,
as their supreme.


This Citie was made a County incorporate of it selfe by King 
Henry
 the seauenth, and is yeare∣ly
gouerned by a 
Mator,
 with Sword and Mace borne before him in State, two 
Sheriffes,
 twentie∣foure

Aldermen,
 a 
Recorder,
 a 
Towne-Clerke,
 and a 
Sergeant of Peace,
 foure 
Sergeants,
 and sixe

Yeomen.


It hath beene accounted the Key into 
Ireland,
 and great pitie it is that the Port should decay as it
daily doth, the Sea being stopped to scoure the Riuer by a Causey that thwarteth 
Dee
 at her bridge.
Within the wals of this Citie are eight Parish-Churches, S. 
Iohns
 the greater and lesser: in the 
Sub∣urbs

are the 
White Fryers, Blacke-Fryers,
 and 
Nunnery
 now suppressed, From which Citie the Pole


is eleuated vnto the degree 53. 58. minutes of Latitude, and from the first point of the West in
Longitude vnto the 17. degree and 18. minutes.


(8) The Earledome whereof was possessed from the 
Conquerour,
 till it fell lastly to the 
Crowne,

the last of whom (though not with the least hopes) is 
Prince Henry,
 who to the Titles of 
Prince of
Wales,
 and 
Duke of Cornwall,
 hath by Succession and right of Inheritance, the 
Earledome of Chester

annexed to his other most happy Stiles: Vpon whose person I pray that the Angels of 
Iacobs
 God
may euer attend; to his great glory, and 
Great Britaines
 happinesse.


(9) If I should vrge credit vnto the report of certaine Trees, floating in 
Bagmere,
 onely against
the deaths of the Heyres of the 
Breretons
 thereby seated, and after to sinke vntill the next like occasi∣on:
or inforce for truth the Prophecie which 
Leyland
 in a Poeticall fury forespake of 
Beeston Castle,

highly mounted vpon a steepe hill: I should forget my selfe and wonted opinion, that can hardly be∣leeue
any such vaine predictions, though they be told from the mouthes of credit, as 
Bagmere Trees

are, or learned 
Leyland
 for 
Beeston,
 who thus writeth:

The day will come when it againe shall mount his head aloft,


If 
 a Prophet may be heard from Seers that say so oft.


With eight other 
Castles
 this Shire hath beene strengthned, which were 
Ould-Castle, Shoclath, Shot∣witch,
Chester, Poulefourd, Dunham, Fr
desham,
 and 
Haulten:
 and by the Prayers (as then was taught)
of eight religious houses therein seated, preserued; which by King 
Henry
 the eight were suppressed:
namely, 
Stanlowe, I
ree, Maxf
ld, Norton, Bunbery, Combermere, Rud-heath,
 and 
Vale-Royall,
 besides
the 
White
 and 
Blacke Fryers,
 and the 
Nunnery
 in 
Chester.


This Counties diuision is into seauen Hundreds, wherein are seated thirteene Market-Townes,
eightie-sixe Parish-Churches, and thirtie eight Chappels of ease.













LANCA-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXXVII.


THE Countie Palatine of 
Lancaster
 (famous for the foure 
Henries,
 the fourth, fift, sixt, and
seauenth, Kings of 
England,
 deriued from 
Iohn of Gaunt
 Duke of 
Lancaster)
 is vpon the South
confined and parted by the Riuer 
Merscy,
 from the Countie Palatine of 
Chester;
 the faire
Countie of 
Darby-shire
 bordering vpon the East; the large Country of 
Yorkeshire,
 together
with 
Westmerland
 and 
Cumberland,
 being her kinde neighbours vpon the North, and the Sea
called 
Ma
 Hebernicum
 embracing her vpon the West.


(2) The forme thereof is long, for it is so inclosed betweene 
Yorke shire
 on the East side, and
the 
Irish Sea
 on the West, that where it boundeth vpon 
Cheshire
 on the South-side, it is broader, and
by little and little more Northward it goeth (confining vpon 
Westmerland)
 the more narrow it
groweth It containeth in length from 
Brathey
 Northward, to 
Halwood
 South-ward, fiftie seauen
miles; from 
Denton
 in the East, to 
F
rmby
 by 
Altmouth
 in the West, thirtie one; and the whole
circumference in compasse, one hundred three-score and ten miles.


(3) The Aire is 
, not troubled with grosse vapours or foggy mists, by rea∣son
whereof the 
 long and healthfully, and are not subiect to strange
and vnknowne deseases.


(4) The Soile for the generalitie is not very fruitfull, yet it produceth such numbers of Cattle,
of such large proportion, and such goodly heads, and hornes, as the whole Kingdome of 
Spaine

doth scarce the like▪ It is a Country replenished with all necessaries for the vse of man, yeelding
without any great labour, the commoditie of Corne, Flaxe, Grasse, Coales, and such like. The


Sea also adding her blessing to the Land, that the people of that Prouince want nothing that serues
either for the sustenance of nature, or the safetie of appetite▪ They are plentifully furnished with all
sorts of Fish, Flesh, and Fowles. Their principall fuell is Coale and Turffe, which they haue in
great abundance, the Gentlemen reseruing their woods very carefully, as a beautie and principall
ornament to their Mannors and houses. And though it be farre from 
London
 (the capitall Citie of
this Kingdome) yet doth it euery yeare furnish her and many other parts of the Land besides, with
many thousands of Cattle (bred in this Country) giuing thereby and otherwayes a firme testimo∣ny
to the world, of the blessed abundance that it hath pleased God to enrich this noble Dukedome
withall.


(5) This Counties ancient Inhabitants were the 
Brigantes,
 of whom there is more mention in
the description of 
Yorkeshire,
 who by 
Claudius
 the Emperour were brought vnder the 
Roman
 subiecti∣on,
that so held and made it their Seat, secured by their Garrisons, as hath beene gathered as well
by many inscriptions found in walles and ancient monuments fixed in stones, as by certaine Altars
erected in fauour of their Emperours. After the 
Romans,
 the 
Saxons
 brought it vnder their protecti∣on,
and held it for a part of their 
Northumbrian
 Kingdome, till it was first made subiugate to the
inuasion of the 
Danes,
 and then conquered by the victorious 
Normans,
 whose posterities from thence
are branched further into 
England.


(6) Places of antiquitie or memorable note are these: the Towne of 
Manchester
 (so famous, as
well for the Market-place, Church, and Colledge, as for the resort vnto it for clothing) was called

Mancunium
 by 
Antonine
 the Emperour, and was made a Fort and Station of the 
Romans.


Riblechester
 (which taketh the name from 
Rhibell,
 a little Riuer neere 
Clithero)
 though it be a small
Towne, yet by tradition hath beene called the richest Towne in Christendome, and reported to
haue beene the Seat of the 
Romans,
 which the many Monuments of their Antiquities, Statues, pee∣ces


of Coine, and other seuerall inscription, digd vp from time to time by the Inhabitants, may
giue vs sufficient perswasion to beleeue.


But the Shire-Towne is 
Lancaster,
 more pleasant in situation, then rich of Inhabitants, built on
the South of the Riuer 
Lon,
 and is the same 
Longouicum,
 where (as we finde in the 
Notice Prouinces)

a company of the 
Longo
icarians
 vnder the Lieutenant Generall of 
Britaine
 lay. The beautie of this
Towne is in the Church, Castle, and Bridge: her streets many, and stretched farre in length. Vnto
this Towne King 
Edward
 the third granted a Maior and two Bailiffes, which to this day are elected
out of twelue Brethren, assisted by twentie-foure Burgesses, by whom it is yearely gouerned, with
the supply of two Chamberlaines, a Recorder, Towne-Clerke, and two Sergeants at Mace. The
eleuation of who
 Pole is in the degree of Latitude 54 and 58. scruples, and her Longitude remo∣ued
from the first West 
 vnto the degree 17 and 4
. scruples.


(7) This Country in diuers places suffereth the force of many flowing Tides of the Sea, by
which (after a sort) it doth violently rent asunder one part of the Shire from the other: as in 
Four∣nesse,

where the 
 displeased that the short should from thence shoot a maine way into
the West, hath not obstinately ceased from time to time to flash and mangle it, and with his fell ir∣ruptions
and boysterous Tides to de
oure it.


Another thing there is, not vnworthy to be recommended to memory, that in this Shire, not far
from 
Fournesse Fell
s,
 the greatest standing water in all 
England
 (called 
Winander-Mere)
 lieth, stret∣ched
out for the space of ten miles, of wonderfull depth, and all paued with stone in the bottome:
and along the Sea-side in many places may be seene heapes of sand, vpon which the people powre
water, vntill it recouer a 
 humour, which they afterwards boile with Turffes, till it become
white salt.


(8) This Country, as it is thus on the one side freed by the naturall resistance of the Sea from


the force of Inuasions, so is it strengthned on the other by many Castles and fortified places, that
take away the opportunitie of making Roades and Incursions in the Country. And as it was with
the first that felt the fury of the 
Saxons
 crueltie, so was it the last and longest that was subdued vnder
the 
West-Saxons
 Monarchie.


(9) In this Prouince our noble 
Arthur
 (who died laden with many trophics of honour) is re∣ported
by 
Ninius
 to haue put the 
Saxons
 to flight in a memorable battle neere 
Duglasse,
 a little Brooke
not farre from the Towne of 
Wiggin.
 But the attempts of warre, as they are seuerall, so they are vn∣certaine:
for they made not Duke 
Wade
 happy in his successe, but returned him an vnfortunate vn∣terpriser
in the Battle which he gaue to 
Arduiph
 King of 
Northumberland,
 at 
Billangho,
 in the yeare
798 So were the euents vncertaine in the 
Ciuill Warres
 of 
Yorke
 and 
Lancaster:
 for by them was bred
and brought forth that bloudy diuision and fatall strife of the Noble Houses, that with variable suc∣cesse
to both parties (for many yeares together) molested the peace and quiet of the Land, and de∣filed
the earth with bloud, in such violent manner, that it exceeded the horrour of those 
Ciuill Warres

in 
Rome,
 that were betwixt 
Mariu
 and 
Scylla, Pompey
 and 
Caesar, Octauius
 and 
Antony;
 or that of the
two renowned Houses 
Valoys
 and 
Eurbon,
 that a long time troubled the State of 
France:
 for in the
diuision of these two Princely Families there were thirteene Fields sought, and three Kings of 
Eng∣land,

one Prince of 
Wales,
 twelue Dukes, one Marques, eighteene Earles, one Vicount, and three
and twentie Barons, besides Knights and Gentlemen, lost their liues in the same. Yet at last, by the
happy marriage of 
Henry
 the seauenth, King of 
England,
 next heire to the House of 
Lancaster,
 with

Elizabeth
 daughter and heire to 
Edward
 the Fourth, of the House of 
Yorke,
 the white and red Roses
were conioyned, in the happy vniting of those two diuided Families, from whence our thrice renow∣ned
Soueraigne Lord King 
Iames,
 by faire sequence and succession, doth worthily enioy the Di
∣deme:
by the benefit of whose happy gouernment, this Countie Palatine of 
Lancaster
 is prosperous
in her Name and Greatnesse.



(10) I finde the remembrance of foure religious houses that haue beene founded within this
Countie (and since suppressed) both faire for structure and building, and rich for seat and situati∣on

namely, 
Burstogh, Whalleia, Holland,
 and 
Penwortham▪
 It is diuided into sixe Hundreds, besides

Fournesse Felles
 and 
Lancasters Liberties,
 that lie in the North part. It is beautified with 15 Market-Townes,
both faire for situation and building, and famous for the concourse of people for buying
and selling. It hath twentie-sixe Parishes, besides Chappels, (in which they duly frequent to diuine
Seruice) and those populous, as in no part of the Land more.















YORKE-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.


AS the courses and confluents of great Riuers are for the most part fresh in memory, though
their heads and fountaines lie commonly vnknowne: so the latter knowledge of great Re∣gions,
are not traduced to obliuion, though perhaps their first originals be obscure, by rea∣son
of Antiquitie, and the many reuolutions of times and ages▪ In the delineation there∣fore
of this great Prouince of 
Yorkshire,
 I will not insist vpon the narration of matters neere
vnto vs; but succinctly run ouer such as are more remote; yet neither so sparingly, as I may seeme
to diminish from the dignitie of so worthy a Country; nor so prodigally, as to spend time in the
superfluous praising of that which neuer any (as yet) dispraised. And although perhaps it may seeme
a labour vnnecessary, to make relation of ancient remembrances, either of the Name or Nature of
this Nation, especially looking into the difference of Time it selfe (which in euery age bringeth
forth diuerse effects) and the dispositions of men, that for the most part take lesse pleasure in them,
then in divulging the occurrents of their owne times: yet I hold it not vnfit to begin there, from
whence the first certaine direction is giuen to proceede; for (euen of these ancient things) there may
be good vse made, eitherby imitation, or way of comparison, as neither the repetition, nor the re∣petition
thereof shall be accounted impertinent.


(2) You shall therefore vnderstand: That the Countie of 
Yorke
 was in the 
Saxon
 tongue called

Ebona-yeyne,
 and now commonly 
Yorkeshire,
 farre greater and more numerous in the Circuit of her
miles, then any Shire of 
England.
 Shee is much bound to the singular loue and motherly ca
 of Na∣ture,
in placing her vnder so temperate a clime, that in euery measure she is 
.


If one part of her be stony, and a sandy barren ground: another is fertile and richly adorned with
Corne-fields. If you here finde it naked, and destitute of Woods, you shall see it there shadowed
with Forrests full of trees, that haue very thicke 
, sending forth many fruitfull and profitable
branches. If one place of it be Moorish, Mirie, and vnpleasant; another makes a free tender of de∣light,
and presents it selfe to the eye, full of beautie and contentiue varietie.


(3) The Bishopricke of 
Durham
 fronts her on the North-side, and is seperated by a continued
course of the Riuer 
Tees
 The 
Germaine Sea
 lieth sore vpon her Bast side, beating the shores with her
boisterous waues and billowes. The West part is bounded with 
Lancashire,
 and 
Westmerland.
 The
South-side hath 
Cheshire
 and 
Darbishire
 (friendly Neighbours vnto her) with the which she is first
inclosed: then with 
Nottingham
 and with 
Lincolne-shires:
 after diuided with that famous Arme of the
Sea 
Humber:
 Into which all the Riuers that water this Country, emptie themselues, and pay their
ordinary Tributes, as into the common receptacle and store-house of 
Neptune,
 for all the watery Pen∣sions
of this Prouince.


(4) This whole Shire (being of it selfe so spatious) for the more easie and better ordering of her
ciuill gouernment, is diuided into three parts: which according to three quarters of the world, are
called 
The West-Riding, The East-Riding,
 and 
The North-Riding. West-Riding
 is for a good space com∣passed
with the Riuer 
Ouse,
 with the bounds of 
Lancashire,
 and with the South limits of the Shire, and
beareth towards the West and South. 
East-Riding
 bends it selfe to the Ocean, with the which, and
with the Riuer 
Derment
 she is inclosed, and lookes into that part where the Sunne rising, and shew∣ing
forth his beames, makes the world both glad and glorious in his brightnesse 
North-Riding
 ex∣tends
it selfe 
Northward,
 
 in as it were, with the Riuer 
Tees
 and 
Derwent,
 and a long race of the
Riuer 
Ouse
 The length of this Shire, extended from 
Ha
thill
 in the South, to the mouth of 
Tees
 in
the North, are neere vnto seauentie miles, the breadth from 
Flambrough-head
 to 
Horn-castle
 vpon the


Riuer 
, is fourescore miles; the whole Circumference is three hundred and eight miles.


(5) The Soile of this County for the generalitie is reasonable fertile, and yeelds sufficiency of
Corne and Cattle within it selfe. One part whereof is particularly made famous by a 
 of
Stone, out of which the stones newly hewen be very soft, but seasoned with winde and 
 of
themselues doe naturally become exceeding hard and solide. Another, by a kind of 
 where∣of
it consisteth, which being burnt, and conueyed into the other parts of the Country, which are
hilly and some what cold, serue to manure and enrich their Corne-fields.


(6) That the 
Romans
 flourishing in military prowesse, made their seuerall stations in this Coun∣try,
is made manifest by their Monuments, by many Inscriptions fastned in the Walles of Churches,
by many Columnes engrauen with 
Roman
 work
 found lying in Church-yards, by many 
 Al∣tars
digd vp that were erected (as it should seeme) to their Tutelar Gods (for they had locall and
peculiar Topicke Gods, whom they honoured as Keepers and Guardians of some particular places
of the Country) as also by a kinde of Brickes which they vsed: for the 
Romans
 in time of peace, to
auoid and withstand idlenesse, (as an enemy to vertuous and valorous enterprises) still exercised
their Legions and Cohorts in casting of ditches, making of High-wayes, building of Bridges, and
making of Brickes, which hauing sithence bin found, and from time to time digd out of the ground,
proue the Antiquitie of the place by the 
Romane
 Inscriptions vpon them.


(7) No lesse argument of the pietie hereof, are the many Monasteries, Abbyes and Religious
houses that haue beene placed in this Country; which whilest they retained their owne state and
magnificence, were great ornaments vnto it: but since their dissolution, and that the teeth of Time
(which deuours all things) haue eaten into them, they are become like dead carkasses, leauing one∣ly
some poore ruines and remaines aliue, as reliques to posteritie, to shew of what beautie and mag∣nitude
they haue beene. Such was the Abbey of 
Whi
y,
 founded by Lady 
Hilda,
 daughter of the


grand-childe vnto King 
Edwine.
 Such was the Abbey built by 
Bolcon,
 which is now so razed and laid
Ieuell with the earth, as that at this time it affords no appearance of the former dignitie. Such was

Kirkstall
 Abbey, of no small account in time past, founded in the yeare of 
Christ
 1147. Such was the
renowned Abbey called S. 
Maries
 in 
Yorke,
 built and endowed with rich liuings by 
Alan
 the third
Earle of little 
Britaine
 in 
America;
 but since conuerted into the Princes house, and is called 
The
Mannour.
 Such the wealthy Abbey of 
Fountaines,
 built by 
T
urstin
 Arch bishop of 
Yorke
 Such was
the famous Monastery founded in the Primitiue Church of the 
East-Saxons,
 by 
Wilfrid
 Arch-bishop
of 
Yorke,
 and enlarged (being fallen downe and decayed) by 
Odo
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury.
 Such
was 
Drax,
 a religious house of 
Chanons.
 Such that faire Abbey built by King 
William
 the Conquerour
at 
Silby
 (where his Sonne 
Henry
 the first was borne) in memory of Saint 
German,
 who happily con∣futed
that contagious 
Pelagian
 Heresie, which oftentimes grew to Serpentine head in 
Britaine.


These places for Religion erected, with many more within this Prouinciall Circuit, and conse∣crated
vnto holy purposes, shew the antiquitie, and how they haue beene sought vnto by confluences
of Pilgrimes in their manner of deuotions: The midst of which superstitious obscurities, are since
cleared by the pure light of the Gospell reuealed, and the skirts of Idolatry vnfolded to her owne
shame and ignominie: And they made subiect to the dissolution of Times, seruing onely as antique
Monuments and remembrances to the memory of succeeding Ages.


(8) Many places of this Prouince are famoused as well by Name, being naturally fortunate in
their situation, as for some other accidentall happinesse befallen vnto them. 
Hallifax,
 famous, as
well for that 
Iohannes defacro Besco,
 Author of the Sphere, was borne there, and for the Law it hath
against stealing, and for the greatnesse of the Parish, which reckoneth in it eleuen Chappels, where∣of
two be Parish-Chappels, and in them to the number of twelue thousand people.


In former times it was called 
Horton,
 and touching the alteration of the name, this prety story is


related of it: namely, That a Clerke (for so they call him) being farre in loue with a maid, and by
no meanes either of long prayses or large promises, able to gaine like affection at her hands, when he
saw his hopes frustrate, and that he was not like to haue his purpose of her, turned his loue into rage,
and cut off the maides head, which being afterwards hung vpon an Ewe tree, common people coun∣ted
it as an hallowed relique till it was rotten: And afterwards (such was the credulitie of that time)
it maintained the opinion of reuerence and Religion still: for the people resorted thither on pilgri∣mage,
and perswaded themselues, that the little veynes that spread out betweene the Barke and Bo∣dy
of the Ewe tree like fine threds, were the very haires of the maids head. Hereupon it was called
by this name 
Haligfax,
 or 
Haly-fax,
 that is, 
Holy-Hayre.


Pomfret
 is famous for the Site, as being seated in a place so pleasant, that it brings forth 
Liquori
e

and great plentie of 
Skiriworts,
 but it is infamous for the murther and bloudshed of Princes: The
Castle whereof was built by 
Hildebert Lacy,
 a 
Norman,
 to whom 
William
 the Conquerour gaue this
Towne, after 
Alrick
 the 
Saxon
 was thrust out of it.


(9) But I will forbeare to be prolixe or tedious in the particular memoration of places in a Pro∣uince
so spatious, and onely make a compendious relation of 
Yorke,
 the second Citie of 
England,
 in
Latine called 
Eboracum
 and 
Eburacum,
 by 
Ptolemy, Brigantium
 (the chiefe Citie of the 
Brigants)
 by

Ninius, Caer Ebrauc,
 by the 
Britaines, Caer Effro
.
 The 
British
 History reports that it tooke the name
of 
Ebrauc
 that founded it; but some others are of opinion, that 
Eburacum
 hath no other deriuation
then from the Riuer 
Ouse
 running thorow it: It ouer-masters all the other places of this Country
for fairenesse, and is a singular ornament & safegard to all the North parts. A pleasant place, large,
and full of magnificence, rich, populous, and not onely strengthened with fortifications, but ador∣ned
with beautifull buildings, as well priuate as publike. For the greater dignitie thereof it was made
an Episcopall See by 
Constantius,
 and a Metropolitane Citie by a 
Pall
 sent vnto it from 
Homorius.


Egbert
 Arch-bishop of 
Yorke,
 who flourished about the yeare seauen hundred fortie, erected in it a
most famous Library. 
Richard
 the third repaired the Castle thereof being ruinous, and King 
Henry

the eight appointed a Counsell in the same, to decide and determine all the causes and Controuer∣sies
of the North parts, according to equitie and conscience: which Counsell consisteth of a Lord
President, certaine Counsellers at the Princes pleasure, a Secretarie, and other Vnder-Officers.


The originall of this Citie cannot be fetcht out but from the 
romanes,
 seeing the 
Britaines
 before
the 
Romanes
 came, had no other Townes then Woods fenced with Trenches and Rampiers, as 
Cae∣sar

and 
Strabo
 doe testifie. And that it was a Colony of the 
Romanes,
 appeares both by the authoritie
of 
Ptolemy
 and 
Antonine,
 and by many ancient Inscriptions that haue beene found there. In this Ci∣tie
the Emperour 
Seuerus
 had his Palace, and here gaue vp his last breath; which ministers occasi∣on
to shew the ancient custome of the 
Romanes,
 in the military manner of their burials.


His body was caried forth here by the Souldiers to the Funerall fire, and committed to the flames,
honoured with the Iusts and Turnaments both of the Souldiers and of his owne sonnes: His ashes
bestowed in a little golden pot or vessel of the Prophyrat stone, were carryed to 
Rome,
 and shrined
there in the monument of the 
Antoni
s.
 In this Citie (as 
Spartian
s
 maketh mention) was the
Temple of the Goddesse 
Bellona;
 to which 
Seuerus
 (being come thither purposing to offer sacrifice)
was erroneously led by a rusticall 
Augur.


Here 
Fl Velerius Constantinus,
 surnamed 
Chlorus
 (an Emperour of excellent vertue and Christian
pietie) ended his life, and was Defied as appeares by ancient Coines: and his sonne 
Constantine
 be∣ing
present at his Fathers death, forthwith proclaimed Emperour; from whence it may be gathered
of what great estimation 
Yorke
 was in those dayes, when the 
Romane
 Emperours Court was held in it.
This Citie flourished a long time vnder the 
English-Saxons
 Dominion, till the 
Danes
 like a mightie
storme, thundring from out the North-East, destroyed it, and distained it with the bloud of many


slaughtered persons, and wan it from 
Osbright
 and 
Flla
 Kings of 
Northumberland,
 who were both
slaine in their pursuite of the 
Danes:
 which 
Alcuine
 in his Epistle to 
Egelred
 King of 
Northumberland,

seemed to pre
age before, when he said; 
What signifieth that raining downe of bloud in S.
 Peters 
Church
of
 Yorke, 
euen in a faire day, and descending in so violent and threatning a manner from the top of the roofe?
may it not be thought that bloud is comming vpon the Land from the North parts?


Howbeit, 
At
e
stane
 recouered it from the 
Danish
 subiection, and quite ouerthrew the Castle, with
the which they had fortified it; yet was it not (for all this) so freed from warres, but that it was
subiect to the Times fatally next following. Neuerthelesse, in the 
Conquerours
 time when (after
many woefull ouerthrowes and troublesome stormes) it had a pleasant calme of ensuing peace, it
rose againe of it selfe, and flourished afresh, hauing still the helping hand both of Nobility and Gen∣try,
to recouer the former dignitie, and bring it to the perfection it hath: The Citizens fenced it
round with new wals, and many towers and bulwarkes, and ordaining good and wholesome lawes
for the gouernment of the same. Which at this day are executed at the command of a Lord Maior,
who hath the assistance of twelue Aldermen, many Chamberlaines, a Recorder, a Towne-Clerke,
sixe Sergeants at Mace, and two Esquires, which are, a Sword-bearer, and the Common Sergeant,
who with a great Mace goeth on the left hand of the Sword. The Longitude of this Citie, accor∣ding
to 
Mercators
 account, is 19. degrees, and 35. scruples: the Latitude 54. degrees and fortie
scruples.


(10) Many occurrents present themselues with sufficient matter of enlargement to this discourse,
yet none of more worthy consequence then were those seuerall Battles, fought within the compasse
of this Countie; wherein Fortune had her pleasure as well as in the proofe of her loue, as in the pur∣suit
of her tyranny; sometime sending the fruits of sweet peace vnto her, and otherwhiles suffering
her to taste the sowrenesse of warre.



At 
Conishorough
 (in the 
Britaine
 tongue 
C
aer Conan)
 was a great battle fought by 
Hengist,
 Captaine
of the 
English-Saxons,
 after he had retyred himselfe thither for his safetie, his men being fled and
scattered, and himselfe discomsited by 
A
relius Ambrosius;
 yet within few dayes after he brought
forth his men to battell against the 
Britaines
 that pursued him, where the field was bloudy both to
him and his; for many of his men were cut in pieces, and he himselfe had his head chopt off, as the

British
 History saith; which the Chronicles of the 
English-Saxons
 deny, reporting that he dyed in
peace, being surcharged and ouer-worne with the troublesome toyles and trauels of warre.


Neere vnto 
Kirkstall, Oswie
 King of 
Northumberland
 put 
Penda
 the 
Mercian
 to flight: the place
wherein the Battle was ioyned, the Writers call 
Winwid Field,
 giuing it the name by the victory. And
the little Region about it (in times past called by an old name 
Elmet)
 was conquered by 
Eadwin

King of 
Northumberland,
 the sonne of 
Aela,
 after he had expelled 
Cereticus
 a 
British
 King, in the
yeare of Christ, 620.


At 
Casterford
 (called by 
Antonine Legeolium
 and 
Legetium)
 the Citizens of 
Yorke
 slew many of King

Ethelreds
 Army, and had a great hand against him, in so much as he that before state in his throne of
Maiestie, was on a sodaine daunted, and ready to offer submission.


But the most worthy of memory, was that Field fought on 
Pal
-Sunday,
 1461. in the quarrell of

Lancaster
 and 
Yorke,
 where 
England
 neuer saw more puissant Forces both of Gentry and Nobilitie:
for there were in the field at one time (partakers on both sides) to the number of one hundred thou∣sand
fighting men. When the fight had continued doubtfull a great part of the day, the 
Lancastrians

not able longer to abide the violence of their enemies, turned backe and fled amaine, and such as
took part with 
Yorke,
 followed them so hotly in chase, and kild such a number of Noble and Gen∣tlemen,
that thirtie thousand 
Englishmen
 were that day left dead in the field.


(11) Let vs now loose the point of this compasse, and saile into some other parts of this Prouince,


to finde out matter of other memorable moment▪ Vnder 
Knansbrough
 there is a Well called 
D
∣ping-well,

in which the waters spring not out of the veynes of the earth, but distill and trickle downe
from the rockes that hang ouer it: It is of this vertue and efficacie, that it turnes wood into stone:
for what wood soeuer is put into it, will be shortly couered ouer with a stony barke, and be turned
into stone, as hath beene often obserued.


At 
Giggleswicke
 also about a mile from 
Settle
 (a Market-Towne) there are certaine small springs
not distant a quaits cast from one another: the middlemost of which doth at euery quarter of an
houre ebbe and flow about the height of a quarter of a yard when it is highest, and at the ebbe fal∣leth
so low, that it is not an inch deepe with water. Of no lesse worthinesse to be remembred is S.

Wilfrids
 Needle, a place very famous in times past for the narrow hole in the close vaulted roome
vnder the ground, by which womens honesties were wont to be tryed: for such as were chaste passe
through with much facilitie; but as many as had plaid false, were miraculously held fast, and could
not creepe through. 
Beleeue if you list.


The credible report of a Lampe found burning (euen in our Fathers remembrance, when Abbeyes
were pulled downe and suppressed) in the Sepulchre of 
constantius,
 within a certaine vault or little
Chappell vnder the ground, wherein he was supposed to haue beene buried, might beget much won∣der
and admiration, but that 
L. Zius
 confirmeth that in ancient times they had a custome to preserue
light in Sepulchres, by an artificiall resoluing of gold into a liquid and farry substance, which should
continue bruning a long time, and for many ages together.


(12) This 
Yorkeshire
 picture I will draw to no more length, least I be condemned with the 
So∣phister,

for insisting in the praise of 
Hercules,
 when no man opposed himselfe in his discommendati∣on.
This Country of it selfe is so beautifull in her owne naturall colours, that (without much helpe)
she presents delightfull varieties both to the fight and other senses.













THE BISHOPRICKE OF DURHAM.
CHAPTER XXXIX.


THe 
Bishopricke of Durham,
 containeth those parts and Towne-ships that 
 the Re∣uer

Tees
 and 
Derwent,
 and all along the 
German-Sea
 
 on the North wit


Northumberland,
 and their Iurisdictions parted by the 
 touched
by 
Cumberland, Westmorland,
 and from 
 Riuer 
Tees,
 and by the same
water on her South, from 
Yorke-shire
 

By the 
German-Sea.


(2) The forme thereof is triangle, 
 for from her South 
 vn∣to
the West-point, are about thirtie miles, from thence to the North-east and 
 are like∣wise
as many, and her base along the Sea-shore are twentie-
 Circumfe∣rence,
about one hundred and three miles.


(3) The ayre is sharpe and very piercing, and would be more, 
 not that the 
 from
the 
German-Seas
 did helpe much to dissolue 
 and snow: and the store of coales therein grow∣ing
and gotten, doe warme the body, and keepe backe the cold; which 
 besides their owne
vse, doth yeeld great commodities vnto this Prouince, by trade thereof 
 other parts.


(4) For Soile, it consisteth much alike of Pastures, 
, and 
 grounds: the East is the
richest and most champion, the South more moorish, but 
 with∣out
either grasse or graine, notwithstanding 
 with as great gaine, both
in rearing vp Cattle, and 

groweth so neere to the vpper 
 wheeles doe turne


vp the same. Some hold their substance to be a clammie kinde of clay hardned with heat aboun∣ding
in the earth, and so becomming concocted, is nothing else but 
Bitumen:
 for proofe whereof,
these Coales haue both the like smell and operation of 
Bitumen:
 for being sprinkled with water, they
burne more vehemently, but with oyle are quite extinguished and put out.


(5) The ancient Inhabitants knowne vnto 
Ptolemie,
 were the 
Brigantes,
 of whom we haue spo∣ken
in the Generall of 
Yorkeshire,
 they being subdued by the 
romans;
 after whom the 
Saxons
 made it
a part of their 
Northumberlands Kingdom;
 at first a Prouince belonging to the 
Deirians,
 and enioyed
by 
Ella
 their first King; afterwards inuaded by the 
Danes,
 and lastly possessed by the 
Normans:
 whose
site being so neere vnto 
Scotland,
 hath many times felt their fury, and hath beene as a Buckler be∣twixt
them and the 
English;
 for which cause, the Inhabitants haue certaine freedomes, and are not
charged with seruice as other Counties are, so that this with 
Westmorland, Cumberland,
 and 
Northum∣berland,

are not diuided into hundreds in those Parliament Rolles whence I had the rest: which want
I must leaue for others to supply.


(6) Ouer this Countie, the Bishops thereof haue had the Royalties of Princes, and the Inhabi∣tants
haue pleaded priuiledge not to passe in seruice of warre ouer the Riuer of 
Tees
 or 
Tyne;
 whose
charge (as they haue alledged) was to keepe and defend the corps of S 
Cuthbert
 their great ado∣red
Saint, and therefore they termed themselues, 
The holy-werk-folkes.
 And the repute of this 
Cuth∣bert

and his supposed defence against the 
Scots
 was such, that our 
English
 Kings in great deuotion
haue gone in pilgrimage to visit his Tombe, and haue giuen many large possessions to his Church:
such were King 
Egfred, Aelfred,
 and 
Guthrun
 the 
Dane, Edward
 and 
Athelstan
 Monarch of 
England,

and zealous 
Cannte,
 the greatest of all, who came thither bare-footed, and at 
Cuthberts
 Tombe both
augmented and confirmed their Liberties. This Saint then, of nothing made 
Durham
 become great,
and 
William
 the 
Conquerour,
 of a 
Bishopricke
 made it a 
County Palatine:
 at that time 
William Careleph,



Bishop of the Diocesse, pulled downe the old Church which 
Aldwin
 had built, and with sumptuous
cost laid the foundations of a new, wherein S. 
Cuthberts
 Shrine in the vacancy of the Bishops, was
the Keeper of the Castle-keyes.


In the West of this Church, and place called 
Gallile,
 the Marble Tombe of venerable 
Beda
 re∣maineth,
who was borne at 
Iaerro
 in this Countie, and became a 
Monke
 at 
Weremouth,
 whose paine∣full
indust
es and light of learning in those times of darknesse are wonderfull, as the volumes which
he wrote doe well declare. And had the idle Monkes of 
England
 imployed their times after his exam∣ple,
their Founders expectations had not beene frustrate, nor those foundations so easily ouertur∣ned.
But the reuenge of sinne euer following the actions of sinnes, dissolued first the largenesse of
this Counties liberties, vnder the raigne of King 
Edward
 the First, and since hath shaken to peices
those places herein erected, vnder the raigne of King 
Henry
 the eight: such were 
Durham, Sherborne,
Stayndr
p, Iarro, 
eremouth,
 and 
Egleton;
 all which felt the reward of their idlenesse, and wrath of
him that is jealous of his owne honour.


(7) 
Things of rare note obserued in this Shire are three pits of a wonderfull depth, commonly
called the
 Hell-Kettles, 
which are adioyning neere vnto
 Darlington, 
whose waters are some what warme.
These are thought to come of an Earth-quake, which happened in the yeare of Grace 1179. whereof
the
 Chrenicle 
of
 Tin-mouth 
maketh mention, whose record is this:
 On Christmas day, at Oxe
hall in the
Territorie of Darlington, within the Bishopricke of Durham, the ground heaued vp aloft, like vnto an high
Tower 
 all that day, as it were vnmoueable, vntill the euening; 
 then fell with so horri∣ble
a noise, that it made all the neighbour dwellers sore afraid: and the earth swallowed it vp, and made in
the same place a deepe pit, which is there to be seene for a testimonie vnto this day.


(8) Of no lesse admiration are certaine stones lying within the Riuer 
Weere,
 at 
Butterbre
 neere

Durham;
 from whose sides at the Ebbe and low water in the Summer, issueth a certaine salt reddish


water, which with the Sunne waxeth white, and growing into a thicke substance, becommeth a
necessary sal
 to the vse of the by-dwellers.


(9) And places of elder times had in a
rount by the 
Romans,
 were 
Benonium,
 now 
Binchester,
 and

C
ndereum, Chester in the street,
 where their monies haue beene digged vp, and at 
Codercu
 so much,
that 
Egelrik
 Bishop of 
Durham
 was therewith made exceeding rich.


This County hath beene strengthned with seauen strong Castles, is yet traded with sixe Market-Townes, and Gods diuine honour in one hundred and eighteene Parish-Churches celebrated.













VVESTMORLAND:
CHAPTER XL.


VVESTMORLAND, by some late Latine Writers is c
lled 
Westmaria,
 and 
Westmor∣landia,

by some later 
Westmoria,
 and in our English Tongue 
Westmorland
 It came
to be thus named in our language by the situation, which in euery part is so plen∣teously
full of Moores and high hils, teaching one to another, that 
Westmorland

(with vs) is nothing else but a Westerne moorish Country. Hauing on the West
and North-side 
Cumberland,
 on the South-part 
Lanca-shire,
 on the East-side 
Yorkeshire,
 and the Bi∣shopricke
of 
Durham.


(2) The length thereof extended from 
Burton
 in her South, to 
Kirkland
 in her North-part is 30.
miles: the broadest part from East to West, is from the Riuer 
Eden
 to 
Dunbal rase-stones,
 containing
24. miles, the whole circumference about 112. miles.


(3) The forme thereof is somewhat long and narrow: the Aire sharpe and piercing, purging
it selfe from the trouble of grosse foggy mists and vapours, by reason of which the people of this Pro∣uince
are not acquainted with strange diseases or imperfections of body, but liue long, and are health∣full,
and attaine to the number of many yeares.


(4) The Soile for the most part of it, is but barren, and can hardly be brought to any fruitful∣nesse
by the industry and painfull labour of the husbandman, being so full of infertile places, which
the Northern 
Englishmen
 call Moores: yet the more Southerly part is not reported to be so sterile,
but more fruitfull in the vallies, though contained in a narrow roome, betweene the Riuer 
Lone,
 and

W
ander mear,
 and it is all termed by one name. The Barony of 
Kendale
 or 
Candale,
 that is, the dale
by 
Can,
 taking the name of the Riuer 
Can
 that runs through it.



(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the 
Brigantes,
 mentioned in the seuerall
Counties of 
Yorke, Lancaster,
 and 
Cumberland.


(6) It is not commended either for plentie of Corne or Cattle, being neither stored with ara∣ble
grounds to bring forth the one, nor pasturage to breed vp the other: the principall profit that
the people of this Prouince raise vnto themselues, is by cloathing.


(7) The chiefest place of which is 
Kandale
 or 
Kendale,
 called also 
Kirkeby Kendale,
 standing on
the banke of the Riuer 
Can.
 This Towne is of great trade and resort, and for the diligent and in∣dustrious
practise of making cloath so excels the rest, that in regard thereof it carrieth a superemi∣nent
name aboue them, and hath great vent & trashque for her wollen cloaths through all the parts
of 
England.
 It challengeth not much glory for Antiquitie; onely this it accounteth a great credit,
that it hath dignified three Earles with the title thereof, as 
Iohn
 Duke of 
Bedford,
 whom 
Henry
 the
Fift (being his brother) aduanced to that honour, 
Iohn
 Duke of 
Sommerset,
 and 
Iohn de Foix,
 whom
King 
Henry
 the sixt preferred to that dignitie for his honourable and trusty seruices done in the

French
 warres. It is a place of very ciuill and orderly gouernment, the which is mannaged by an 
Al∣derman,

chosen euery yeare out of his twelue Brethren, who are all distinguished and notified from
the rest by the wearing of purple garments The Alderman and his Senior Brother are alwayes
Iustices of Peace and Quorum. There are in it a Towne-Clerke, a Recorder, two Sergeants at
Mace, and two Chamberlaines. By Mathematicall obseruation the site of this Towne is in the de∣gree
of Longitude 17. 30. scruples, from the first West point, and the Pole eleuated in Latitude to
the degree 55. and 15. minutes


(8) Places of memorable note for Antiquitie are 
Vertera,
 mentioned by 
Antonine
 the Empe∣rour;
and 
Aballaba,
 which we contractly call 
Apelby.
 In the one, the Northerne 
English
 conspired
against 
William
 the 
Conquerour
 in the beginning of the 
Norman
 gouernment. In the other, the 
A
rel
∣an


Maures
 kept a station in the time of the 
Romanes,
 and their high streete is yet apparently to be
seene by the ridges thereof which lead by 
Apelby
 to a place called 
Brouonacum,
 mentioned in the
Booke of Prouinciall notices. The antique pieces of 
Romane
 Coyne other whiles digd vp hereabouts,
and some Inscriptions not long since found, shew of what continuance they haue beene: although
Time, which deuouteth all things, hath so fed vpon their carkasses many ages together, as it hath
almost consumed both houses and Inhabitants. For 
Apelby
 now is bare both of people and building;
and were it not for the antiquitie that makes it the more esteemable, in whose Castle the Assises
are commonly kept, it would be little better in account then a village 
Verterae
 is long since decay∣ed,
and the name of it changed into 
Burgh:
 for it is commonly named 
Burgh
 vnder 
Sta
emore.
 In
which, it is said, a 
Romane
 Captaine made his abode with a band of 
Directores,
 in the declining age
of the 
Romane
 Empire. These two places 
William
 of 
Newborough
 calleth Princely Holds, and wri∣teth
that 
William
 King of 
Scots
 a little before he himselfe was taken prisoner at 
Alnewicke,
 surprized
them on a sodaine, but King 
Iohn
 recouered them after, and liberally bestowed them vpon 
Robert
V
pont,
 for his many worthy seruices.


(9) There is mention made but of one religious house that hath beene in all this Country, and
that was a little Monastery seated neere vnto the Riuer Lod
, built by 
Tho
as
 the sonne of 
Gospa∣tricke,

the sonne of 
Orms:
 where there is a fountaine or spring that ebbes and flowes many times a
day, and it is thought that some notable Act of Atchieuement hath beene performed there, for that
there be huge stones in forme of Pyramides, some nine foot high, and fourteene foot thicke, ranged
for a mile in length directly in a row, and equally distant, which might seeme to haue beene there
purposely pitc
ed in memory thereof: but what that Act was is not now knowne, but quite worne
out of remembrance by times iniurie.


(10) Other matters worthy obseruation are onely these: That at 
Amboglana,
 now called 
Am∣ble-side,



neere the vpper corner of 
Winander mear,
 there appeares at this day the ruines of an ancient
Citie, which by the 
British-Brickes,
 by 
Romane-money
 oftentimes found there, by 
High-wayes
 paued
leading vnto it, and other likelihoods, seemes to haue beene a worke of the 
Romanes:
 The Fortresse
thereof so long fenced with a ditch and rampire, that it tooke vp in length one hundred thirtie two
Ells, and in bredth eight. There are also neere 
Kendale
 in the Riuer 
Can,
 two 
Catadupae
 or 
Waterfals,

where the waters descend with such a forcible downefall, that it compels a mightie noyse to be
heard, which the neighbour Inhabitants make such vse of, as they stand them in as good stead as
Prognostications: for when that which standeth North from them soundeth more cleare, and with
a louder eccho in their eares, they certainly looke for faire weather to follow: But when that on the
South doth the like, they expect foggy mists and showres of raine.


(11) This Prouince is traded with foure Market-Townes, fortified with the strength of seuen
Castles, and hath 26. Parishes in it for the celebration of Diuine Seruice.








CVMBERLAND.
CHAPTER XLI.


CVMBERLAND, the furthest North-west Prouince in this Realme of 
England,
 confron∣teth
vpon the South of 
Scotland,
 and is diuided from that Kingdome partly by the Riuer 
ir∣so
,

then crossing 
Eske,
 by a tract thorow 
Solome-Mosse,
 vntill it come to the 
Solwaye Frith,

by 
Ptolemie
 called the 
 Baye.
 The North-west part is neighboured by 
Northumberland,

more East-ward with 
Westmerland,
 the South with 
Lancashire,
 and the West is wholly washed
with the 
Irish Seas.


(2) The forme whereof is long and narrow, pointing wedge-like into the South, which part is
altogether pestred with copped-hilles, and therefore hath the name of 
Cop-land.
 The middle is more
leuell, and better inhabited, yeelding sufficient for the sustenance of man: but the North is wilde
and solitary, combred with hilles, as 
Copland
 is.


(3) The ayre is piercing, and of a sharpe temperature, and would be more biting, were it not
that those high hilles breake off the Northerne stormes, and cold falling snowes.


(4) Notwithstanding, rich is this Prouince, and with great varieties thereof is replenished: the
hilles, though rough, yet smile vpon their beholders, spread with sheepe and cattle, the vallies sto∣red
with grasse and corne sufficient: the Sea affordeth great store of fish, the land ouer-spread with
varietie of fowles, and the Riuers feed a kinde of Muskle that bringeth forth Pearle, where in the
mouth of the 
Irt,
 as they lie gaping and sucking in dew, the Country people gather and sell to the

Lapidaries,
 to their owne little, and the buyers great gaine. But the 
Mines Royall
 of 
Copper,
 whereof
this Country yeeldeth much, is for vse the richest of all: the place is at 
Keswick
 and 
Newland,
 where


likewise the 
Blacke Lead
 is gotten, whose plentie maketh it of no great esteeme; otherwise a commo∣ditie
that could hardly be missed.


(5) The ancient Inhabitants knowne to the 
Romans,
 were the 
Brigantes,
 whom 
Ptolemie
 disper∣seth
into 
Westmorland, Richmond, Durham, York-shire,
 and 
Lanca-shire.
 But when the 
Saxons
 had o∣uer
borne the 
Britaines,
 and forced them out of the best, to seeke their resting among the vast Moun∣taines,
these by them were entred into, where they held play with those enemies maugre their force,
and from them, as 
Mariama
 doth witnesse, the Land was called 
Cumber,
 of those 
Kumbri
 the 
Bri∣taines.

But when the State of the 
Saxons
 was fore shaken by the 
Danes,
 this 
Cumberland
 was accounted
a Kingdome it selfe; for so the Flower-gatherer of 
Westminster
 recordeth: 
King
 Edmund (saith he)

with the helpe of Leoline Prince of South-Wales, wasted all Cumberland, and hauing put out the eyes of the
two sonnes of Dunmail King of that Prouince, granted that Kingdome vnto Molcolm King of Scots,
 whereof
their eldest sonnes became Prefects. This Prouince, King 
Stephen,
 to purchase fauour with the 
Scots,

what time he stood in most need of ayd, confirmed by gift vnder their Crowne; which 
Henry
 the
second notwithstanding made claime vnto and got, as 
Newbrigensis
 writeth, and laid it againe in
the Marches of 
England:
 since when, many bickerings betwixt these Nations herein haue hapned,
but none so sore against the 
Scotish
 side, as was that at 
Sallome-Mosse,
 where their Nobilitie disdai∣ning
their Generall 
Oliuer Sinclere,
 gaue ouer the Battle, and yeelded themselues to the 
English;

which dishonour pier
ed so deeply into the heart of King 
Iames
 the fift, that for griefe thereof he
shortly after died.


(6) Many memorable Antiquities remaine and haue beene found in this County: for it being
the Confines of the 
Romans Possessions,
 was continually secured by their 
Garrisons,
 where remaine a

this day parts of that admirable wall built by 
Seuer
s:
 also another Fortification from 
W
rkinton
 to

Elus Mouth,
 vpon the Sea-shoare toward 
Ireland,
 by 
Stilico
 raised, when vnder 
Theodosius
 he suppres∣sed


the rage of the 
Picts
 and 
Irish,
 and freed the Seas of the 
Saxons Pirats.
 Vpon 
Hard-knot
 hill,

Moresby, Old Carleil, Pap-castle
 along the Wall, and in many other places, their ruines remaine, with
altars, and Inscriptions of their Captaines and Colonies, whereof many haue beene found, and
more as yet lie hid.


(7) The chiefest Citie in this Shire is 
Carlile,
 pleasantly seated betwixt the Riuers 
Eden, Petterell,

and 
Caud,
 by the 
Romans
 called 
Luguvallum;
 by 
Beda, Luell;
 by 
Ptolemy, Leucopibia;
 by 
Nu
tu
 Caer-Lu
lid;

and by vs 
Carlile.
 This Citie flourishing vnder the 
Romans,
 at their departure, by the furious
outrages of the 
Scots
 and 
Picts
 was deiected, yet in the dayes of 
Egfrid
 King of 
Northumberland
 was
walled about: but againe defaced by the ouer-running 
Danes,
 lay buried in her owne ashes the space
of two hundred yeares; vpon whose ruines at length 
Rufus
 set his compassionate eye, and built there
the Castle, planting a Colony of 
Flemings
 to secure the Coasts from the 
Scots,
 but vpon better ad∣uisement
remoued them into 
Wales.
 After him, 
Henry
 his brother and successour ordained this Citie
for an Episcopall See: whose site is placed in the degree of Longitude from the first West part 17.
and 2. scruples, and the Pole thence eleuated from the degree of Latitude 55. and 56. scruples.


(8) West from hence, at 
Burgh
 vpon the sand, was the fatall end of our famous Monarch King

Edward
 the first, who there leauing his warres vnfinished against 
Scotland,
 left his troubles, and soone
missed life, to his vntimely and soone lamented death.


(9) And at 
Salkelds
 vpon the Riuer 
Eden,
 a Monument of seuentie seuen stones, each of them
ten foot high aboue ground, and one of them at the entrance fifteene, as a Trophie of Victory was
erected. These are by the By-dwellers called 
Long Megge and her daughters.


(10) This County, as it stood in the fronts of assaults, so was it strengthned with twentie-fiue
Castles, and preserued with the prayers (as then was thought) of the 
Votaries
 in the houses erected
at 
Carlile, Lenecoft, Wetherall, Holm
, Daker,
 and 
Saint Bees.
 These with others were dissolued by


King 
Henry
 the eight, and their reuenewes shadowed vnder his Crowne: but the Prouince being
freed from charge of subsidie, is not therefore diuided into Hundreds in the Parlament Rowles,
whence we haue taken the diuisions of the rest: onely this is obserued, that therein are seated nine
Market-Townes, fiftie eight Parish-Churches, besides many other Chappels of ease.













NORTHVMBERLAND.
CHAPTER XLII.


THe County of 
Northumberland,
 hath on the South the Bishopricke of 
Durham,
 being shut in
with the Riuer 
Derwent,
 and with 
Tyne;
 the North is confined vpon 
Scotland,
 the West vpon
part of 
Scotland
 and part of 
Cumberland:
 the East-side lyeth altogether vpon the Sea, called

Mare-Germanicum.


(2) The forme thereof is Triangle, and differs not much in the sidings; for from her South-East
vnto the South-West-point are neere vnto 40. miles; from thence to 
 North-point are sixty
miles, and her base along the Sea-shoare 45. miles: The whole in circum
 is about one hun∣dred
fortie fiue miles.


(3) The Ayre must needs be subtile and piercing, for that the Northernly parts are most expo∣sed
to extremitie of weathers, as great winds, hard frosts, and long lying of snowes, &c. Yet would
it be farre more sharper then it is, were not the 
Germane Seas
 a ready meanes to further the dissolu∣tion
of her Ice and Snow, and the plentie of Coales there gotten, a great helpe to comfort the bo∣dy
with warmth, and defend the bitter coldnesse.


(4) The Soile cannot be rich, hauing neither fertilitie of ground for Corne or Cattle, the most
part of it being rough, and in euery place hard to be manured, saue onely towards the Sea and the Ri∣uer

Tyne,
 where, by the great diligence and industrious paines of good husbandry, that part is become
very fruitfull.


(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country, mentioned by 
Ptolemie,
 were called OTTALI∣NI,
OTTADENI, and OTTADINI, which by an easie alteration (as M. 
Cambden
 saith) if it


had 
ene called OTTATINI, signifying, about the Riuer 
Tyne,
 or on the further side of 
Tyne


 this people were planted) there would haue beene much consonance both with the name of
the Inhabitants, and the Position and Site of the Prouince.


(6) The chiefest commoditie that enricheth this Countie, are those Stones 
Linthancraces,
 which
we call Sea-coales, whereof there is such plentie and abundance digged vp, as they doe not onely
returne a great gaine to the Inhabitants, but procure also much pleasure and profit to others.


(7) No place of this Prouince vents forth so many of these Sea-coales into other regions as

Newcastle
 doth, being the very eye of all the Townes in this County: for it doth not onely mini∣ster
reliefe (by such prouision) to all other parts of 
England,
 but doth also farnish the wants of for∣raine
Countries with her plentie. By meanes of this and the intercourse of traffique which it hath,
the place is growne ex
eeding rich and populous. Before the 
Conquest
 it was called 
Monk-chester:

hauing beene (
) in the possession of 
Monkes:
 and 
Chester
 being added, which signifies
a bulwarke or place of defence, shewes that in ancient time it had beene a place of Fortification.


(8) After the 
Conquest
 it got the name of 
Newcastle▪
 by the new Castle which 
Robert
 the Sonne
of 
William
 the 
Conquerour
 built there, out of the ground. What it was called in old time is not
knowne, yet some are of opinion, that it may be thought to haue beene 
Gatrosentum
 for that 
Gates∣head,

the suburbe (as it were) of the same, expresseth in the owne proper signification that 
British

name, 
Gatrosentum
 It is now most enobled both by the Hauen (which 
Tyne
 maketh) of that no∣table
depth, that it beareth very tall Ships, and is able to defend them against stormes and tempests.
As also by many fauours and honours wherewith it hath beene dignified by p
ces: for 
Richard
 the
second, granted that a Sword should be carried before the Maior, and 
Henry
 the sixt made it a Coun∣ty
consisting of a Corporation within it selfe. It is adorned with foure Churches, and fortified with
strong wals that haue eight gates. It is distant from the first West line 21 degrees and 30 minutes,


and from the Equinoctiall liue towards the North-pole thirtie-foure degrees and fiftie-seaven mi∣nutes.


(9) The vtmost Towne in 
England,
 and the strongest hold in all 
Britaine,
 is 
Barwicke.
 From
whence it had the name is not certainely made knowne. Some fetch it from 
Berengarius,
 a Duke
(neuer read of:) Howsoeuer, this is better to be said then trusted: and whence soeuer it hath the
name, it is seated betweene two mightie Kingdomes, shooting farre into the Sea, with the which,
and the Riuer 
Tweed,
 it is almost encompassed: and whensoeuer any discord fell betweene the two
Nations, this place was the first thing they tooke care of. It hath endured the brunts of diuers in∣roades
and incursions, and beene oftentimes both possessed and repossessed of the 
Scots
 and 
Eng∣lish:

But since it was reduced vnder the command of 
Edward
 the fourth, our Kings haue from time
to time so strengthened it with new workes and fortifications, as they cut off all hopes of winning
it. The Gouernour of this Towne is also Warden of the East Marches against 
scotland.
 The Lon∣gitude
of it according to Mathematicall obseruation, is 21. degrees and 43. minutes: the Latitude
55. degrees and 48. minutes.


(10) The Inhabitants of this County are a warlike people, and excellent light horsemen, and are
made fierce and hard by the seuerall encounters of the 
Scots,
 and not much vnlike them in neither,
betwixt whom in this County, many Battles haue beene fought, and the successes oftentimes waued
through very doubtfully, the victory sometimes falling to the 
scots,
 sometimes to the 
English.
 At

Otterburne
 was one, in which three or foure times it stood doubtfully indifferent, till in the end the

Scots
 got the vpper hand of the 
English:
 Howbeit, their glory was not made so illustrious by this
Conquest, but that it was as much darkened by the foile they receiued at 
A
wicke,
 where 
William

King of 
Scots,
 was taken and presented prisoner to 
Henry
 the second. As also by that Battell at 
Brum∣ridge,

where King 
Athelstan
 fought a pitcht field against 
Anlafe
 the 
Dane, Constantine
 King of 
Scots,







and 
Eugenius
 King of 
Cumberland,
 and that with such fortunate successe, as it hath left matter suffi∣cient
to fill the pennes of Historians. 
Flodden
 field also, memorable in the death of 
Iames
 the fourth,
King of 
Scots,
 who was there slaine, and his Army ouerthrowne in a sharpe fight, as he displayed his
Banner (in great hope) against 
England,
 when King 
Henry
 the eight lay at the siege of 
Turnay
 in

France


(11) Other Battles in this Countie haue beene, as that at 
Hexam
 (called by 
Bede, Hangustald)

wherein 
Iohn Neuill, Marquesse Montacute,
 encountred the Leaders of the 
Lancastrian
 faction with
much courage, and with greater successe put them to flight, for which he was made Earle of 
Nor∣thumberland

by 
Edward
 the fourth As also that at 
Dilston
 (by 
Bede
 called 
Diuelshur
e,)
 where 
Os∣wald

hauing the faith of Christ for his defence and armour, slew 
Cedwall
 the 
Britaine
 in a set battell,
himselfe straight-wayes becomming a professed Christian, and causing his people to be instructed
in Christian Religion.


(12) Many memorable antiquities are found in this Country along the wall, and in other places:
As pieces of Coyne, Inscriptions, broken and vnperfect Altars, &c. (the ruines of the wall yet to be
seene:) but none that deserues more to be remembred then 
Wall-Towne
 (by 
Bede
 called 
Ad Muru
)

for that 
Segebert
 King of the 
East-Saxons
 was in it baptized in the Christian Faith by the hands of

Paulinus:
 and 
Halyston,
 where the same 
Paulinus
 is said to haue baptized many thousands into the
Faith of Christ, in the Primitiue Church of the 
English
 Nation.


(13) 
Busy-gap
 is a place infamous for robbing and theeuing, and is therefore rather remembred
as a cautiatory note for such as haue cause to trauell that way, then for any proper matter of worth
it hath, that merits place with other parts of this Prouince.


Other matters of obseruation are onely these, that North 
Tyne
 (running through the 
Wall)

waters two Dales, which breed notable light horse-men, and both of them haue their hils (hard by)


so boggy, and standing with water on the top, that no horsemen are able to ride through them,
and yet (which is wonderfull) there be many great heapes of Stones (called 
Lawes)
 which the
neighbouring people are verily perswaded were cast vp and laid together in old time, in remem∣brance
of some that were slaine there. There is also a martiall kinde of men which lie out, vp and
downe in little Cottages (called by them 
Sheals
 and 
Shealings)
 from Aprill to August, in scattering
fashion, summering (as they terme it) their Cattle, and these are such a sort of people as were the
ancient 
Nomades.
 The last, not least, matter of note is this, that the Inhabitants of 
Morpeth
 set their
owne Towne on fire in the yeare of Christ 1215. in the spight they bare to King 
Iohn,
 for that he
and his 
Rutars
 ouer-ranne these Countries.


This County hath fiue Market-Townes in it for her trade of buying and selling, 26. Castles for
her strength and fortification, and 460. Parish-Churches for diuine seruice.













MAN ILAND.
CHAPTER XLIII.


THe 
Ile of Man
 is termed by 
Ptolemy, M
neda;
 by 
Pliny, Menauia;
 by 
Orosius, Menania
 by

Beda, Menania secunda,
 and by 
Gyldas, 
,
 and 
M
naw.
 The 
Britaine
 name it 
Men
w
;
the Inhabitants, Ma
ge; and we 
Englishmen, The Ile of Man
 It boundeth North-ward vp∣on

Scotland,
 South-ward vpon the Ile of 
Anglesey,
 East-ward vpon part of 
-shire,
 and
West-ward vpon the Coast of 
Ireland.


(2) The forme is long and narrow: for from 
 to the 
Mull-hils,
 where it is longest, it
onely stretcheth it selfe to twentie nine miles; but from the widest part, which is from 
Peele-Castle

to 
Douglas-point,
 are scarce nine; the whole compasse about, is fourescore and two miles.


(3) The ayre is so cold and sharpe, being bordering vpon the 
 parts, and for her
shelter hauing but a wall of water. They haue few woods; onely they light sometimes vpon so subter∣ranean
trees buried vnder the ground, by digging vp the earth for a 
lammie kinde of 
, which
they vse for fuell.


(4) The soile is reasonable fruitfull both for Cattle, Fish, and Corne; yet it rather commen∣deth
the paines of the people then the goodnesse of the ground; for by the industry of the Inhabi∣tants
it 
eeldeth sufficiency of euery thing for it selfe, and sendeth good store into other Countries.
It hath fields (by good manuring) plenteous of Barley and Wheat, but especially 
 and from
hence it comes that the people eate most of all Oaten-bread. It beares abundance of 
 and
Flaxe, and is full of mightie flockes of sheepe and other Cattell: yet are they smaller in body then
we haue in 
England,
 and are much like to the Cattle in 
Ireland
 that are neighbouring vpon it.



(5) This commoditie makes this Iland more happie then we are here: for the people are there
free from vnnecessary commencements of Suites, from long and dilatory Pleas, and from friuolous
feeing of Lawyers No Iudge or Clerks of the Court take there any penny for drawing Instruments,
or making of Processes All Controuersies are there determined by certaine Iudges, without wri∣tings
or other charges, and them they call 
Deemsters,
 and chuse forth among themselues, If any com∣plaint
be made to the Magistrate for wrongs eyther done or suffred, he presently taketh vp a stone,
and fixeth his marke vpon it, and so deliuereth it vnto the partie plaintiffe, by vertue of which he
both cals his aduersary to appearance, and to produce his witnesses. If the case fall out to be more
litigious, and of greater consequence then can easily be ended, it is then referred to twelue men,
whom they terme 
The Keyes of the Iland.
 Another happinesse enricheth this Iland, namely the securi∣tie
and gouernment thereof, as being defended from neighbour enemies by Souldiers that are prest
and ready; for on the South-side of the Ile stands 
Bala-Curi
 (the Bishops chiefe place of residence)
and the 
Pyle,
 and a 
Block-house
 standing in a little Iland, where there is a cōtinuall Garrison of Soul∣diers.
And it is so well managed for matter of rule and ciuill discipline, that tuery man there posses∣seth
his owne in peace and safetie. No man liues in dread or danger of losing what he hath. Men
are not there inclined to robbing or theeuing, or licentious liuing.


(6) The Inhabitants of this Iland are for the most part religious, and louing to their Pastors,
to whom they doe much reuerence and respect, frequenting daily to diuine Seruice, without diui∣sion
in the Church or innouation in the Common-weale. The wealthier sort, and such as hold the
fairest possessions, doe imitate the people of 
Lanca-shire,
 both in their honest carriage and good
house-keeping. Howbeit, the common sort of people both in their language and manners, come
nighest vnto the 
Irish,
 although they somewhat rellish and fauour of the qualities of the 
Norwegi∣ans.



(7) Things not worthy to be buryed in the graue of obliuion are, that this Iland in the midst
thereof riseth vp with hils, standing very thicke; amongst which the highest is called 
Sceafull,
 from
whence vpon a cleare and faire day, a man may easily see three Kingdomes at once; that is, 
Scotland,
England,
 and 
Ireland.
 This Ile prohibits the customary manner ofbegging from doore to doore,
detesting the disorders, as well Ciuill as Ecclesiasticall of neighbour Nations. And last, not least,
that deserues to be committed to memory, is, that the women of this Country, wheresoeuer they
goe out of their doores, gird themselues about with the winding-sheete that they purpose to be bu∣ried
in, to shew themselues mindfull of their mortalitie: and such of them as are at any time con∣demned
to dye, are sowed within a sacke, and flung from a rocke into the Sea.


(8) The whole Isle is diuided into two parts, South and North, whereof the one resembleth the

Scotish
 in speech, the other the 
Irish.
 It is defended by two Castles, and hath seauenteene Parishes,
fiue Market-Townes, and many Villages.








A Chronicle of the Kings of MAN.
CHAPTER XLIIII.


IT is here very pertinent to the purpose, to insert a small History of this Iland, that the atchieuements
heretofore had, may not be vtterly buryed, although they are waxen very old, and almost torne from
remembrance by the teeth of Time. It is confessed by all, that the 
Britaines
 held this Iland, as they did
all 
Britaine.
 But when the Nations from the North ouerflowed those South parts, like violent tempests,
it became subiect to the 
Scots.
 Afterwards, the 
Norwegians
 who did most hurt from the Northerne
Sea by their manifold robberies, made this Iland and the 
Hebrides
 to be their baunt, and erected Lords and
petry Kings in the same, as is expressed in this Chronicle, written (as is reported) by the Monkes of the Ab∣bey
of 
Russin.




A Chronicle of the Kings of MAN.


ANno Dom. 1065. 
Edward,
 of blessed memory, King of 
England,
 departed this life, and 
Ha∣rald

the Sonne of 
Godwyn
 succeeded him in the Kingdome: against whom 
Harald Harfager

(King of 
Norway)
 came into the field, and fought a Battle at 
Stainford-bridge:
 but the

English
 obtaining the victory, put them all to flight. Out of which chase 
Godred,
 surnamed

Crovan,
 the sonne of 
Harald the blacke
 of 
Iseland,
 came vnto 
Godred
 the sonne of 
Syrric,
 who
Raigned then in 
Man,
 and honourably receiued him.


(2) The same yeare 
William
 the 
Bastard
 Conquered 
England,
 and 
Godred
 the son of 
Syrric
 died,
his sonne 
Fingal
 succeeding him.



(3) An. 1066. 
Godred Crovan
 assembled a great Fleet, and came to 
Man,
 and sought with the
people of the Land, but receiued the worst, and was ouercome.


The second time renewing his Forces and his Fleet, he failed into 
Man,
 and ioyned Battle with
the 
Manksmen,
 but was vanquished as before, and driuen out of the field. Howbeit, what he could
not at first bring to passe with power in those two seuerall onsers, he afterward effected by policie.
For the third time gathering a great multitude together, he arriued by night in the hauen called 
Ra
∣sey,

and hid three hundred men in a Wood, which stood vpon the hanging hollow brow of an hill
called 
Sceafull.
 The Sunne being risen, the 
Manksmen
 put their people in order of Battle, and with
a violent charge encountred with 
Godred.
 The fight was hot for a time, and stood in a doubtfull
suspence, till those three hundred men starting out of the Ambush behinde their backes, began to
foile the 
Manksmen,
 put them to the worst, and forced them to flie. Who seeing themselues thus dis∣comfited,
and finding no place of refuge left them to escape, with pitifull lamentation submitted
themselues vnto 
Godred,
 and besought him not to put to the sword such poore remainder of them as
was left aliue. 
Godred
 hauing compassion on their calamities, (for he had beene nursed for a time
and brought vp among them) sounded a retreat, and prohibited his Host any longer perfuie. He be∣ing
thus possessed of the 
Ile of Man,
 dyed in the Iland that is called 
Ile,
 when he had raigned sixteene
yeares. He left behinde him three sonnes, 
Lagman, Harald,
 and 
Olaue.


(4) 
Lagman
 the eldest, taking vpon him the Kingdome, raigned seauen yeares. His brother 
Ha∣rald

rebelled against him a great while; but at length was taken prisoner by 
Lagman,
 who caused
his members of generation to be cut off, and his eyes to be put out of his head, which crueltie this

Lagman
 afterwards repenting, gaue ouer the Kingdome of his owne accord, and wearing the badge
of the Lords Crosse, tooke a iourney to 
Ierusalem,
 in which he dyed.


(5) An 1075. all the Lords and Nobles of the Iland
 hearing of the death of 
Lagman,
 dispatched


Ambassadours to 
Murecard O-brien,
 King of 
Ireland,
 and requested that he would send some worthy
and industrious man of the Bloud Royall to be their King, till 
Olaue
 the sonne of 
Godred
 came to
full age. The King yeelding to their request, sent one 
Dopnald
 the sonne of 
Tade,
 and charged him
to gouerne the Kingdome (which by right belonged to another,) with lenitie and gentlenesse.
But after be was come to the Crowne, forgetting, or not weighing the charge that his Lord and Ma∣ster
had giuen him, swayed his place with great tyranny, committing many outrages and cruelties,
and so raigned three yeares: till all the Princes of the Ilands agreeing together, rose vp against him,
and made him flie into 
Ireland.


(6) An. Dom. 1111. 
Olaue
 the sonne of 
Godred Crouan
 aforesaid, began his raigne, and raigned
fortie yeares a peaceable Prince. He tooke to wife 
Affrica,
 the daughter of 
Fergus
 of 
Gal-way,
 of
whom he begat 
Godred.
 By his Concubines he had 
Raignald, Lagman,
 and 
Harald,
 besides many
daughters, whereof one was married to 
Summerled,
 Prince of 
Herergaidel,
 who caused the ruine of
the Kings of the Ilands. On her he begat foure sonnes, 
Dulgal, Raignald, Engus,
 and 
Olaue.


(7) An. Dom. 1144 
Godred
 the sonne of 
Olaue,
 was created King of 
Man,
 and raigned thiritie
yeares. In the third yeare of his raigne the people of 
Dublin
 sent for him, and made him their King.
Which 
Mure-card
 King of 
Ireland
 maligning, raised warre, and sent 
Osibeley
 his halfe brother by
the mothers side with 3000. men at Armes to 
Dublin,
 who by 
Godred
 and the 
Dublinians
 was slaine,
and the rest all put to flight. These atchieuements made, 
Godred
 returned to 
Man,
 and began to vse
tyranny, turning the Noblemen out of their inheritances. Whereupon one called 
Thorfin (vtters

sonne) being mightier then the rest, came to 
Summerled,
 and made 
Dulgal (Summerleds
 sonne)
King of the Ilands: whereof 
Godred
 hauing intelligence, prepared a Nauie of 80. Shippes to meet

Summerled.
 And in the yeare 1156. there was a Battle fought at Sea on Twelfth day at night, and
many slaine on both sides But the next day they grew to a pacification, and diuided the Kingdome


of the Ilands among themselues. This was the cause of the ouerthrow of the Kingdome of the
Iles.


(8) Ann 1158. 
Summerled
 came to 
Man,
 with a fleet of fiftie three saile, put 
Godred
 to flight,
and wasted the Iland. 
Godred
 vpon this crossed ouer to 
Norway
 for ayde against 
Summerled.
 But

Summerled
 in the meane time arriuing at 
Rhinfrin,
 and hauing gathered together: fleet of 160 ships,
couerting to subdue all 
Scotland,
 by the rust iudgement of God, was vanquished by a few, and both
himselfe and his sonne slaine, with an infinite number of people.


(9) The fourth day after, 
Raignald,
 began to raigne, but 
Godred
 comming vpon him out of

Norway
 with a great multitude of Armed men, tooke his brother 
Raignald,
 and be rest him both of
his eyes and genitall members. On the fourth Ides of 
Nouember,
 An. Dom. 1187. 
Godred
 King of
the Ilands dyed, and his body was translated to the 
Ile of Ely▪
 He left behinde him three sonnes,

Raignald, Olaue,
 and 
Yuar.
 He ordained in his life time that 
Olaue
 should succeed him, because he
onely was borne legitimate. But the people of 
Man
 seeing him to be scarce ten yeares old, sent for

Raignald,
 and made him their King. I his caused great diuision, and many turbulent attempts be∣tweene
the two Brethren for the space of thirtie eight yeares; which had no end, till at a place cal∣led

Tnigualla
 there was a battle strucke betweene them, wherein 
Olaue
 had the victory, and 
Raignald

was slaine. The Monkes of 
Russin
 translated his body vnto the Abbey of S. 
Mary de Fournes,
 and
there interred it in a place which himselfe had chosen for that purpose.


(10) An. 1230. 
Olaue
 and 
Godred Don
 (who was 
Raignalds
 sonne) with the 
Norwegians
 came
to 
Man,
 and diuided the Kingdome among themselues. 
Olaue
 held 
Man,
 and 
Godred
 being gone vn∣to
the Ilands, was slaine in the Ile 
Lodhus
 So 
Olaue
 obtained the Kingdome of the Isses. He dyed
the twelfth Calends of 
Lune,
 Anno 1237. in Saint 
Patrickes
 Iland, and was buryed in the Abbey of

Russin.



(11) 
Harrold
 his sonne succeeded him, being foureteene yeares of age, and raigned 12 yeares.
In the yeare 1239. he went vnto the King of 
Norway,
 who after two yeares confirmed vnto him,
his heyres and successours, vnder his Seale, all the Ilands which his predecessours had posses∣sed.


(12) An. 1242. 
Harrold
 returned out of 
Norway,
 and being by the Inhabitants honourably re∣ceiued,
had peace with the Kings of 
England
 and of 
Scotland.
 The same yeare he was sent for by the
King of 
Norway,
 and married his daughter. In the yeare 1249. as he returned homeward with his
wife, he was drowned in a tempest neere vnto the coasts of 
Radland.


(13) An Dom. 1249. 
Raignald
 the sonne of 
Olaue,
 and brother to 
Harrold,
 began his raigne,
and on the thirtieth day there of was slaine by one 
Yuar
 a Knight, in a meadow neere vnto the holy

Trinitie Church,
 and lyeth buryed in the Church of S. 
Mary
 of 
Russin.


(14) In the yeare 1252. 
Magnus,
 the sonne of 
Olaue,
 came to 
Man
 and was made King. The next
yeare following he went to the King of 
Norway,
 and stayed there a yeare.


(15) In the yeare 1265. 
Magnus (Olaues
 sonne) King of 
Man,
 and of the Ilands, departed this
life, at the Castle of 
Russin,
 and was buryed in the Church of S. 
Mary
 of 
Russin.


(16) In the yeare 1266. the Kingdome of the Ilands was translated, by reason of 
Alexander

King of 
Scots,
 who had gotten into his hands the Westerne Ilands, and brought the 
Ile of Man
 vn∣der
his dominion, as one of that number.


(17) An. 1340. 
William Montacute
 Earle of 
Salisbury
 wrested it from the 
Scotish
 by strong hand
and force of Armes: and in the yeare 1393. (as 
Thomas Walsingham
 saith) he sold 
Man
 and the
Crowne thereof vnto 
William Scroope
 for a great summe of money But he being beheaded for high
Treason, and his goods confiscate, it came into the hands of 
Henry
 the Fourth, King of 
England,

who granted this Iland vnto 
Henry Percy
 Earle of 
Northumberland.
 But 
Henry Percy
 entring into


open rebellion the fift yeare following, the King sent Sir 
Iohn Stanley
 and 
William Stanley
 to seize the
Ile and Castle of 
Man,
 the inheritance whereof he granted afterwards to Sir 
Iohn Stanley
 and his
heyres by Letters Patents, with the Patronage of the Bishopricke, &c. So that his heyres and suc∣cessours,
who were honoured with the Title of 
Earles
 of 
Darby,
 were commonly called 
 of

Man.
















HOLY ILAND.
CHAPTER XLV.


THis Iland is called 
Lindisfarne,
 by the Riuer 
Lied
 that is opposite vnto it on the Coast of

Northumberland. Beda
 termeth it a 
Deiny Iland.
 The 
Britaine
 name it 
, for that
it twice euery day suffreth an extraordinary inundation and ouer-flowing of the Ocean in
manner of an Iland, which twice likewise makes it continent to the Land, and returning vn∣to
her watrie habitation, layes the Shoare bare againe, as before. It is called in English,

Holy-Iland,
 for that in ancient times many 
Monkes
 haue beene accustomed to retire themselues thi∣ther,
and to make it their receptacle for solitude: hauing on the West and South, 
Northumberland,

and more South-Eastward the Iland 
Farne.


(2) The forme of it is long and narrow, the West side narrower then the East, and are both
conioyned by a very small spang of land that is left vnto Comes. The South is much 
 then
the rest It is from East to West, about two thousand two hundred and fiftie pases; and from North
to South, twelue hundred and fiftie pases; so that the circumference cannot be great.


(3) The ayre is not very good either for health or delight, as being seated on those parts that
are subiect to extremitie of cold, and greatly troubled with vapours and toggy mists that arise from
the Seas.


(4) The soile cannot be rich, being rockie and full of stones, and vnfit for Corne and T
age.
It is neither commended for hils to seed sheepe, nor pastures to fit Cattle, 

replenished with sweet springs, or running riuellets, onely one excepted, 
 standing
pond. The onely thing this Iland yeeldeth, is a stand accomodate 
 and fow∣ling.



(5) Notwithstanding, this is very worthy of note concerning the same, which 
Alcun
 wrote in
an Epistle to 
Egelred
 King of 
Northumberland,
 namely, that it was a place more venerable then all
the places of 
Britaine,
 and that after the departure of S. 
Paulinus
 from 
Yorke,
 there Christian Reli∣gion
began in their Nation, though afterwards it there felt the first beginning of misery and cala∣mitie,
being left to the spoyle of Pagans and M
oants.


(6) It is also remembred of this Iland, that sometimes there hath beene in it an Episcopall See,
which 
A
dan
 the 
Scot
 instituted (being called thither to Preach the Christian Faith to the people of

Northumberland)
 being thus delighted with the solitary situation thereof, as a most fit place for re∣tire.
But afterwards when the 
Danes
 
isled and robbed all the Sea-Coasts, the Episcopall See was
translated to 
Durham.


(7) This Iland so small in account either for compasse or Commoditie, and so vnpeopled and
vnprofitable, cannot be numerous in Townes and Villages. It hath in it onely one Towne, with a
Church and a Castle, vnder which there is a commodious Hauen, defended with a Block-house, si∣tuate
vpon in hill towards the South-East.




FARNEILE.


THis Ile South-eastward seuen miles from 
Holy Iland,
 sheweth it selfe distant almost two miles
from 
Bambrough
 Castle. On the West and South it beareth vpon 
Northumberland,
 and on
the North-east-side it hath other smaller Ilands adioyning to it, as 
Widopens
 & 
Staple Iland,

which lie two miles off 
Bronsinan,
 and two lesser then these, which are called the 
Wambes.


(2) The forme of this Ile is round, and no larger in compasse then may easily be ridden


in one halfe of a day. The bredth of it is but fiue miles, and the length no more. The whole circum∣ference
extends it selfe no further then to fifteene miles.


(3) The ayre is very vnwholesome, and subiect both to many 
Dysenteries
 and other diseases,
by reason of the mistie fogges and exhalations that are thereunto drawne vp from the Ocean. It is
many times troubled with vnusuall tempests of windes, with boisterous fury of stormy raines, and
with seuerall and vncouth rages of the Sea.


(4) The soile cannot be fertile, being encircled about with craggy clifts; neither hath it in it
much matter either of pleasure or profit. It can neither defend it selfe from cold, lacking fuell, as
Wood, Coale, Turffes, &c. nor from famine, wanting food, as Corne, Pastures, Cattle, &c. The best
commoditie it yeelds, is Fish and Fowle.


(5) This thing neuerthelesse is worthy to be remembred of it, which 
Beda
 (writing of the life of

Cuthbert
 Bishop of 
Lindisfarne,
 that 
Tutelar Pa
ron
 of the 
Northerne Englishmen)
 reporteth, namely,
that in this Ile he built a Citie fitting his gouernment, and erected certaine houses in the same; the
whole building standing almost round in compasse, and reaching the space of foure or fiue pearches.
The wall about it he made higher then a mans height, to with-hold and keepe in the want on lasciui∣ousnesse
both of his thoughts and eyes, and to eleuate the whole intention of his minde vp to hea∣uenly
desires, that he might wholly giue himselfe to the seruice of God. But these are all made the
ruines of time, as sithence many other Monuments haue beene, of worthy antiquitie.


(6) I cannot report that there are now many houses standing in it, much lesse Townes or Vil∣lages.
Onely this, that it hath a Tower or place of Fortification belonging vnto it, placed well-neere
in the middle part of the Ile.








GARNSEY.


THis 
Iland
 lieth about fiue leagues Northwest from 
Iersey,
 and is compassed (like to her neigh∣bour)
with the 
British Sea.
 It lieth in length from 
Plymouth
 bay South-west, to 
Lancrosse de
Ancke
 Northeast, thirteene miles: in bredth from S. 
Martins point
 Southeast, to the 
Howe

Northwest nine miles; and is in circuit thirtie sixe miles. The Emperour 
Antonine
 hauing
the rule and domination of 
France
 (at that time called 
Gaule,
 from whence the word 
Gallia

is deriued) did name this Iland 
Sarnia,
 which afterward by the change of Times and corruption of
Languages, was long since (and is at this day) called 
Garnsey.


(2) This Ile in forme and fashion standeth in the Sea, much like to a Parke that is incompassed
round about with a Pale of Rockes, being very defensible vnto the Iland from the attempting inno∣uation
of enemies.


(3) The Aire and Climate of this Ile hath little or no difference in temper or qualitie from that
of 
Iersey.
 And this deserues to be remembred of it; that in this Ile is neither Toade, Snake, Adder,
or any other venemous creature, and the other hath great plentie.


(4) It standeth for the most part vpon a rocke, very high in many places from the Sea. Neuer∣thelesse
the Soile is very fruitfull, yeelding forth great plentie of grasse for their Sheepe and other
Cattell, which they haue to serue all vses▪ Their fields in the Summer time are so naturally garni∣shed
with flowers of all sorts, that a man (being there) might conceit himselfe to be in a pleasant
artificiall garden.


(5) The Inhabitants are not so much giuen to tillage as they of 
Iersey,
 though the soile be as
fruitfull. They haue of late taken great delight in planting and setting of trees of all sorts, and espe∣cially
of Apples, by reason whereof they make much Cider. Their commodities are alike, and their
helpes from the Sea no lesse, or rather more.



(6) In this Ile are many great steepe Rocks, among which is found a hard stone called by the

Frenchmen Smyris,
 which we terme 
Emerill.
 This stone is seruiceable for many purposes, and many
Trades, as Glasiers, &c. but especially for the Goldsmiths and Lapidaries, to cut their precious
stones.


(7) It hath a head of Land vpon the North part thereof, the passage into which is so narrow,
that a man would thinke that at euery Tyde (the Sea beating strongly on both sides) it were in a
continuall danger to be sundred from the other part of the Ile. This place is called S. 
Michaelin the
Vale,
 where (in former times) stood a Priory, or a Couent of religious persons, the ruines where∣of
are at this day to be seene.


(8) The gouernment of this Ile, in nature and forme resembles the other of 
Iersey,
 of whom
shall be said. The people in their Originall and Language alike also, but in their customes and
conditions they come neerer the ciuill fashions of the 
English.
 Other matters of moment I finde
not worthy to be recorded.


It hath ten Parishes, and one Market-Towne, being also a Hauen, and is called S. 
Peters Port,

built close by the 
Peere,
 and 
Castle Cornet.








IERSEY.


THe two Ilands 
Iersey
 and 
Garnsey,
 being the onely remaines of the Dukedome of 
Norman∣die,

that in former times many yeares together was in the possession, and vnder the command
of the Kings of 
England,
 annexing thereunto a large Territory and glorious title to the
Crowne, are both seated in the Sea called 
Mare Britannicum,
 the Ocean parting them a good
distant asunder, and are now both adiuncts, and within the circuit of 
Hampshire.
 For the first
(being the Isle of 
Iersey)
 it lyeth vpon the 
British Sea,
 hauing on the North parts the coasts of

Hampshire,
 and on the South the Country of 
Normandy.


(2) This Iland is long, not much vnlike the fashion of an Egge. It containes in length from

Sentwon Poole
 vpon the West, to 
Mount Orguil
 Castle on the East, ten miles, and in bredth from 
Du∣bon
point
 to 
Plymount-bay
 six miles: the whole circuit of the Iland being thirtie eight miles▪ It is di∣stant
from a little Iland called 
Alderney,
 about foure leagues. It was in old time called 
Caesaria;
 whe∣ther
from 
Iulius Octanius,
 or any the other 
Caesars
 that followed, is vnknowne. But the 
French-men

haue by corruption of speech long time called it 
Iersey.


(3) It is a very delightsome and healthfull Iland, and giueth a pleasant aspect vnto the Seas.
It lyeth Southward not farre from a craggie ridge of rocks, which is much feared of the Mariners,
and makes the passage that way very dangerous, howbeit it serues for a forcible defence against Pi∣rats,
or any strangers that attempt inuasion, and they are termed 
Casquets.


(4) The Soile is very fertile, bringing forth store of Corne and Cattle, but especially of sheepe,
that are of reasonable bignesse, the most of them bearing foure hornes a peece: Their wooll very fine
and white, of which the Inhabitants make their Iersey stockings, which are ordinarily to be had in
most parts of 
England,
 and yeeld a great commoditie vnto the Iland.


(5) The first originall of the Inhabitants sprung either from the 
Normans,
 or 
Britaines,
 or both.


They speake 
French,
 though after a corrupt manner, and haue continued their names, language, cu∣stomes,
and Country, without any, or little intermixture, these many hundred yeares, hauing beene
vnder the jurisdiction of the 
English
 euer since the vntimely and vnnaturall death of 
Robert
 Duke of

Normandie,
 eldest sonne to 
William
 the 
Conquerour.


(6) The people of this Country liue very pleasantly, as well by the profits of the Land, as the
helpes and furtherances of the Sea, that yeelds vnto them (and especially in Summer season) great
store of fish, but principally Conger and Lobsters, the greatest and fattest vpon the coast of 
Eng∣land

Wood is very scant, for their best fuell is Turffe: some Coale they haue brought vnto them,
but it is very deare; straw, furre, and ferne seruing their ordinary vses. The middle part of the Iland
hath many prety Hils rising in it, yeelding a delightfull obiect vnto the vallies, that receiue from
one another a mutuall pleasure.


(7) The Gouernour of the Ile is the Captaine thereof, who appointeth certaine Officers vn∣der
him: the principall of whom, carrieth the name and title of a Bailiffe, that in ciuill causes hath
the assistance of twelue Iurats to determine of differences, and minister Iustice: in criminall mat∣ters
seuen: in matters of reason and conscience, fiue. Their twelue are chosen out of the twelue Pa∣rishes:
so that no man goeth further to complaine, then to his owne Iurate in ordinary Controuer∣sies;
but matters of moment and difficultie are determined before the Bailiffe in a generall mee∣ting.


(8) This Ile hath two little Ilands adiacent; the one S. 
Albons,
 the other 
Hillary Iland.
 It hath
twelue Parishes, and foure Castles. No other Monuments of name or note.















THE DESCRIPTION OF WALES.
CHAPTER I.


ANtiquitie hath auouched, that the whole Isle of 
Britaine
 was diuided into three parts▪ The
first and fairest lay contained within the 
French
 Seas, the Riuers of 
Seuerne, Dee,
 and 
Hum∣ber,

called then 
oyger,
 which name yet it retaineth in 
W
sh;
 in 
English
 called 
England.

The second part occupied all the land Northward from 
Humber,
 to the 
Orkney
 Sea, called
by the 
Latines, Mare Caledonium,
 or 
Deucaledonium,
 now famously knowne by the name of

Scotland.
 The third part was this, lying betwixt the 
Irish
 Seas, the Riuers 
Seuerne
 and 
Dee,
 and was
called 
Cambria,
 which name doth yet continue with them, though we, the 
English,
 call it 
Wales,
 as the
people 
Welshmen,
 which is 
strange
 and 
strangers;
 for so at this day the dwellers of 
Tyroll
 in the high∣er

Germany,
 whence our 
Saxons
 are said to haue come, doe name the 
Italian
 (their next neighbour)
a 
Welshman,
 and his language 
Welsh.


(2) This opinion 
Verstegan
 doth altogether contradict, rather iudging by the ancient 
Tentonicks

tongue, which the 
Germans
 spake, and wherein the 
G.
 is pronounced for 
W.
 that these 
Saxons
 called
them 
Gallish
 from the 
Go
les,
 whence their originall proceeded, rather then 
Wallish
 from strangers:
which he thinketh could not be, considering their habitations 
o neere vnto them; and that the like
was in vse, he proueth by the words of 
French, Gardian
 for 
Wardian, Corangalles
 for 
 yea,
and 
Galles
 for 
Wales,
 calling our most famous 
Edward,
 Prince of 
Galles,
 not Prince of 
Wales;
 inso∣much
that the County of 
Lombardy,
 bordering along vpon the 
Germans,
 was of them called 
Gallia


Cis-alpina,
 and at this day 
Welsh-land.
 So likewise doe the 
Netherlanders
 call the Inhabitants of 
Henal

and 
Artois, Wallen
 or 
Wallons,
 and some parts of 
Braban
 and 
Flander
, Welsh-Braban
,
 and 
Welsh-Flan∣ders,

and all because of the language or lineage of the 
Gaules.
 Neither do the meere Natiues of 
Wales

know any other name of their Country then 
Cambria,
 of themselues, then 
Cambri
 or 
Cumri,
 or of their
language then 
Cambraoc.
 But leauing this opinion free to his affection, we will proceed▪


(3) 
Wales
 therefore being anciently bounded as before, the 
Saxons
 did afterwards win by force
from the 
Britaines,
 all the plaine and champion Country ouer the Riuer 
Dee;
 and especially 
Offa

King of 
Mercia,
 made their limits straiter, by making a ditch of great bredth & depth, to be a Meere
betwixt his Kingdome and 
Wales.
 This ditch is in many places to be seene at this day, and beares the
name of 
Claw
 Offa,
 that is, 
Offaes Ditch.
 The Country betweene it and 
England
 is commonly cal∣led
the Marches, and is for the most part inhabited by 
Welshmen,
 especially in 
North-Wales,
 euen to
the Riuer 
Dee.
 This admirable Trench began at 
Bassingwerke
 in 
Flintshire,
 betweene 
Chester
 and

Ruthlan,
 and ran along the hils to the South Sea, a little from 
Bristow,
 reaching aboue an hundred
miles in length.


(4) 
Siluester Giraldus
 makes the Riuer 
Wye
 to be the Meare betweene 
England
 and 
Wales,
 on the
South part, called 
South-Wales:
 whence he ascribeth the breadth of 
Wales
 vnto 
Saint Dauids
 in 
Me∣neuia,

to be an hundred miles; and the length from 
Caerleon
 vpon 
Vske
 in 
Gwentland,
 to 
Holly head
 in

Anglesey,
 an hundred miles, he might haue said thirtie more.


(5) About the yeare of Christ 870. our 
Alfred
 raigning in 
England, Rodericus Magnus
 King of

Wales
 did diuide it into three, Talaiths, Regions, or Territories, which were called Kingdomes.
This 
Rodericus Magn
 gaue 
Venedotia, Gwineth
 or 
North-Wales,
 to 
Anarawd
 his eldest sonne; to

Cadeth
 his second sonne, 
Demetia, Deheubarth
 or 
South-Wales;
 and to 
Meruin
 his third sonne,

Powys.



(6) 
North-Wales
 had vpon the North side, the 
Irish
 Sea, from the Riuer 
Dee
 at 
Bassingwerke
 to

Aberdyni:
 vpon the West and South-West, the Riuer 
Dyni,
 which diuideth it from 
South-Wales,
 and
in some places from 
Powysland.
 And on the South and East, it is diuided from 
Powys,
 sometimes
with high hils, and sometimes with Riuers, till it come againe to the Riuer 
Dee.
 It is generally full of
high mountaines, craggie rockes, great woods, and deepe vallies, many straight dangerous places,
deepe and swift Riuers.


(7) This Land was of old time diuided into foure parts, 
Môn, Aruon, Meryonyth,
 and 
y Berued
∣wlan,

or the middle Country, and each of these were againe diuided into seuerall Cantrenes, and
they subdiuided into their Cymeden or Commots, wherein we follow that diuision which was in the
time of 
Llewylyn ap Gruffin,
 last Prince of 
Wales,
 according to a Copie imparted to me by a worship∣full
friend and learned Antiquarie, as seeming farre more exact then that of Doctor 
Powels.


(8) 
Anglesey
 the chiefest, is separated from the maine Land with the Riuer 
, wherein at

Aberfraw
 was the Princes Court, now a meane village. In this Iland is a faire Towne called 
Beau∣marish,

and a common passage to 
Ireland
 at 
Caergy
i,
 in 
English, Holly-head.


(9) 
Aruon,
 the second part of 
North-Wales,
 is now called 
Carnaruonshire,
 the strongest Country
within that Principalitie, giuing place to none for fertilitie of the ground, of for plentie of Wood-Castle,
Fish, and Fowle, &c. Here are the Townes of 
Ca
naruon,
 in old time called 
Caer-Segon
,

and 
Bangor
 the Bishops See, with diuers other ancient Castles, and places of memory. This porti∣on
hath on the North, the Sea and 
Moena
;
 vpon the East and South-east, the Riuer 
, which
diuideth it from 
Denbigh-shire:
 and on the South-west is separated from 
Merioneth,
 by Riuers, Moun∣taines,
and Meares.


(10) 
Merioneth
 was the third part of 
Gwyneth,
 and keepeth the name till this day: is full of hilles,
and much noted for the resort of people that repaire thither to take Hertings. Vpon the North it


hath 
Aruon
 and 
Denbigh-land;
 vpon the South, 
Caerdigan-shire;
 and vpon the East, 
Montgomery-shire,

heretofore part of 
Powys.
 In this Countie standeth the Towne of 
Harleth,
 and a great Lake
called 
Ilyn Tegyd.
 This Country is likewise full of Cattle, Fowle, and Fish, and hath in it great store
of redde Deere and Roes, but there is much scarcitie of Corne.


(11) 
Y Beruedhwlad
 was the fourth part of 
Gwyneth,
 and may be called in 
English,
 The middle
Country: is inclosed with hilles, on the East, West, and South-parts, and with the Sea Northward.
It is plentifull of Cattle, Fish, and Fowle, as also of Corne: and is diuided in the middest with the
Riuer 
Clwyd,
 to which run a number of other Riuers from the hilles. In this part is 
Dyffryn Clwyd,

the fairest Valley within 
Wales,
 containing eighteene miles in length, and seauen in breadth. In
which is the Towne and Castle of 
Ruthlan,
 neere vnto the Sea; and not farre thence, S. 
Assaph,
 an
Episcopall seat, betweene the Riuers 
Clwyd
 and 
Elwy.
 Herein stands the faire Towne and goodly
Castle of 
Denbigh,
 situated vpon a Rocke, the greatest Market-Towne of 
North-Wales:
 and from
thence is seene the Towne and Castle of 
Ruthyn,
 faire for prospect, and fruitfull for site. This part of

North-Wales,
 hath the Sea vpon the North; 
Dee
 toward the East; 
Aruon,
 the Riuer 
Conwey,
 and 
Me∣rionyth

vpon the West; and the Country then called 
Powys,
 vpon the South.


And these were the Meares and bounds of the foure parts of 
Venedotia, Gwyneth,
 or 
North-Wales.


(12) The second 
Talaith
 or Kingdome, was 
Mathraual
 or 
Powys.
 To this belonged the Coun∣try
of 
Powys,
 and the Land betweene 
Wye
 and 
Seuerne.
 It had 
South-Wales
 vpon the South and West,
with the Riuers 
Wye
 and 
Tywy,
 and other Meares: vpon the North, 
Gwyneth;
 and vpon the East,
the Marches of 
England,
 from 
Chester
 to 
Wye,
 a little aboue 
Hereford.
 This part was diuided into

Powis Vadoc, Powis
 betweene 
Wye
 and 
Seuerne,
 and 
Powis Wenwynwyn
 In 
Powis Vadoc
 is the Castle
of Holt in 
Bromefeild,
 and the Castle of 
Chirke
 in 
Chirkeland;
 the Castle likewise of 
Whittington;
 and
Lordship of 
Oswestrie,
 with others.



(13) The second part of 
Powis,
 or the Territory belonging to 
Mathraual,
 is 
Powis
 betweene

Wye
 and 
Seuerne,
 (or 
Gwy
 and 
Hauren)
 whereof some is at this day in 
Montgomery-shire,
 some in

Radnor-shire,
 and some in 
Brecknock-shire;
 and among sundry other, hath these Townes and Castles
following.


Montgomery:
 The Castle of 
Clyn:
 The Towne of 
Knighton:
 The Castle of 
Cymaron: Presteyn:

The Towne and Castle of 
Radnor,
 called in 
Welsh, Maesyuet,
 which is at this day the Shire-Towne:
The Towne of 
Kinton,
 and the Castle of 
Huntingdon.


(14) The third part belonging to 
Mathranal
 (chiefe seat of 
Powys,
 after the 
Welsh
 were driuen
from 
Pengwern
 or 
Shrewsburie)
 was 
Powys Wenwynwyn;
 a Country full of Woods, Hilles, and Ri∣uers,
hauing in it among others, the Townes of 
Welsh-Poole, Newtowne, Machinhaeth Arustly
 was
anciently in this part, but afterward it came to the Princes of 
Gwyneth.


This may suffice, for the description of that which in old time was called 
Gwyneth
 and 
Powys.


(15) It now remaineth that we describe the last kingdome of 
Wales,
 called 
Demetia, Deheubarth,

or the 
Talaith
 of 
Dineuowr,
 which although it was the greatest, yet was it not the best, because it
was much molested with 
Flemings
 and 
Normans,
 and for that also diuers parts thereof would not o∣bey
their Prince, as in 
Gwent,
 and in 
Morganw
.


(16) This was diuided into sixe parts, of which 
Caerdigan
 was the first, and is a Champion
Countrey, without much Wood. It hath 
Merionyth-shire
 on the North: part of 
Powys
 vpon the
East: 
Carmarden-shire
 and 
Pembroke-shire,
 with the Riuer 
Tiu
,
 vpon the South: and vpon the West,
the 
Irish
 Sea. In this part is the Towne of 
Caerdigan
 vpon 
Tiu
,
 not farre from the Sea; as also the
Towne of 
Aberstwyth
 vpon the Riuer 
Istwyth;
 and 
Lhanbadarneuowr,
 which in times past was a
great Sanctuary: there were also many Castles; as of 
Stratneyrie,
 of 
Walter,
 of 
Lhanrysted,
 of 
Dy∣uer
h,

and of 
Aber Roydell,
 &c.



(17) The second part was called 
Dyuet,
 and at this day 
Penbroke-shire.
 It hath vpon the North
and West, the 
Irish
 Sea; vpon the East, 
Carmarden-shire;
 and vpon the South, 
Seuerne.
 There are in
it sundry Townes and Hauens: among others, these: 
Penbroke: Tenby: Hereford West,
 with the good∣ly
and many branched Hauen of 
Milford,
 called in 
Welsh, Aberdangledhett: S. Dauids,
 or 
Meneui
,

which is the chiefest See in 
Wales: Fiscard,
 called 
Aberwayn:
 and 
Newport,
 named 
Tresdreth.


(18) The third part was 
Caermarden-shire,
 which is a Country accounted the strongest part of
all 
South-Wales:
 as that which is full of high Mountaines, great Woods, and faire Riuers.


(19) The fourth, called 
Morganwe,
 now 
Glamorgan-shire,
 hath on the South, the 
Seuerne
 Sea,
which diuideth it from 
Deuonshire
 and 
Cornewall:
 vpon the West and North-west, 
Carmarden-shire:

vpon the North-east, 
Breckneck-shire;
 and vpon the East, 
Monmouth-shire.


(20) The fift, now called 
Gwent,
 and in 
Monmouth-shire,
 hath in it the ancient Citie of 
Caerlbeon

vpon 
Vske.
 There are also diuers Townes and Castles, 
Chepstow, Glynstrygul, R
s, Tynterne
 vpon the
Riuer 
Wye,
 &c. This is a faire and fertile Country. It hath on the West, 
Glamorgan
 and 
Breck∣nock-shires:

vpon the North, 
Hereford-shire:
 vpon the East, 
Glocester-shire:
 with the Riuer 
Wye
 and
the Riuer 
Seuerne
 vpon the South and South-east.


(21) The last is 
Brecknock-shire,
 for the most part full of Mountaines, Woods, and Riuers.
This Country is both great and large, being full of faire plaines and vallyes for Corne: it hath
plentie of the thicke Woods, Forrests, and Parkes. It is full also of cleere and deepe Riuers, of which

Seuerne
 is the chiefest; although there be other faire Riuers, as 
Vske
 and the like.


(22) Thus farre concerning the ancient 
Welsh
 diuision by 
Talaiths:
 but the present diuision di∣stributeth
them more compendiously into two Countries, and twelue Shires, enacted so by Parla∣ment
vnder King 
Henry
 the eight. The Countries are 
North-Wales
 and 
South-Wales,
 which haue sha∣red,


and as it were deuoured betweene them, all 
Powysland;
 each of which Countries containes
sixe Shires.




North-Wales.



Anglesey.


Ca
aruon.


Merionyth.


Denbigh.


Flint.


Montgomery




South-Wales.



Caerdigan.


Pembroke.


Carmarden.


Glamorgan.


Brecknocks.


Radn
r.






But whereas 
Monmouth-shire,
 and 
Radnor,
 were anciently parts, the first of 
South-Wales,
 the other
of 
Powys-land: Monmouth-shire
 by Act of Parlament also vnder the same King, was pluckt away
wholly from 
Wales,
 and laid to 
England,
 one of whose Counties and Shires, it was from that time
forward, and is at this present reckoned; and 
Radnor-shire
 (as it were in lieu thereof) is comprehen∣ded
in 
South-Wales. Humphrey H
yd
 a 
Welsh
 Gentleman, in his Epistle and Map of old 
Wales,
 ma∣keth
mention of a 
West-Wales,
 which he calleth 
Demetia
 and 
Dyser,
 the one the 
Latine,
 and the other
the 
British
 name thereof: but because it is wholly swallowed vp by this last diuision, we will not
perplex the Reader with superfluous and impertinent recitals.













PEMBROKE-SHIRE.
CHAPTER II.


PEMBROKE-SHIRE, the furthest Promontory of all 
West-Wales,
 lieth parted on the North
from 
Cardigan-shire
 with the Riuers 
Ty
y
 and 
Keach;
 and on the East is confronted by 
Caer∣marden-shire;

the South and West shooting farre into the 
Irish Seas,
 is with the same altoge∣ther
washed.


(2) The forme thereof is longer then it is broad; for from S: 
 South-point to 
Car∣digan-bridge

in the North, are twentie-sixe miles; the Easterne 
Landenie
 to S. 
Dauids
 point in the
West, are twentie miles; the whole in circumference is nintie three miles.


(3) The Aire is passing temperate, by the report of 
Giraldus,
 who confirmeth his reason from
the site of 
Ireland,
 against which it butteth, and so neere adioyned, that King 
Rufus
 thought it possi∣ble
to make a Bridge of his Shippes ouer the Sea, whereby he might passe to 
Ireland
 on foot.


(4) 
Anciently it was possessed by the
 Demetia, 
further branched into
 Cardigan 
and
 Caermarden-shires,

as in that County hath beene said, and in the
 Saxons Conquest 
and
 Heptarchte, 
by the
 Britaines

forced into those parts for refuge, whither
 Henry 
the first, and third of the
 Normans 
King, sent cer∣taine

Flemings 
(whose Country was ouer-whelmed with the breaking 
 of the Seas) to inhabite
the maritine Tract called
 Rosse, 
lying West vpon the Riuer
 Dougledye. Thess Dutchmen 
(saith
 Gi∣raldus)
were a strong and stout Nation, inured to Warres, and accustomed to seeke gaine by Clothing, Traf∣fique,
and Tillage, and euer readie for the Field to fight it out: 
adding withall, that
 they were most loyall
to the English, and most faithfull to the English-men. 
Whereupon
 Malmesbury 
writeth thus:
 Many a
time did King 
William Rufus
 assaile the Welsh, but euer in vaine: which is to be wondred at, considering


his other fortunate successe. But 
(saith he)
 it may be the vneuennesse of the ground, and sharpnesse of the
aire, that maintained their courage, and impeached his valour: which to redresse, King 
Henry
 his brother
found meanes; for those Flemings, who in regard of his mothers kindred by the fathers side, sorely pestred
and endammaged the English, he sent into Wales, both to purge and disburden his owne Kingdome, and to
quell and keepe backe the courage of his enemies. 
These men here seated, deceiued not his expectation,
but so carried themselues in his quarrell, that they seldome communicated with their neighbours,
so that to this day they speake not the Language, and the Country is yet called
 Little England beyond
Wales.


(5) The commodities of this Shire are Corne, Cattle, Sea-Fish, and Fowle, and in 
Giraldus

his dayes of saleable Wines, the Hauens being so commodious for Ships arriuage: such is that at

Tenby,
 and 
Milford,
 an Hauen of such capacitie, that sixteene Creekes, fiue Bayes, and thirteene
Roades, knowne all by seuerall names, are therein contained, where 
Henry
 of 
Richmond,
 of most
happie memory arriued with signall hopes of 
Englands
 freedome from vnder the gouernment of an
vsurping Tyrant.


(6) Neere vnto this is 
Pembroke
 the Shire-Towne seated, more ancient in shew then it is in
yeares, and more houses without Inhabitants, then I saw in any one Citie thorowout my suruey.
It is walled long-wise, and them but indifferent for repaire, containing in circuit eight hundred and
fourescore pases, hauing three Gates of passage, and at the West end a large Castle, and locked-cau∣sey,
that leads ouer the water to the decayed Priory of 
Monton.
 The site of this Towne is in the de∣gree
of Longitude, as 
Mercator
 doth measure, 14. and 55. minutes, and the eleuation from the
North-pole in the degree of Latitude 52.


(7) A Citie as barren is old 
Saint Dauids,
 neither clad with Woods, nor garnished with Riuers,
nor beautified with Fields, nor adorned vvith Meadowes, but lieth alwayes open both to winde and


stormes. Yet hath it beene a Nursery to holy men; for herein liued 
Calph
rnius,
 a 
Britaine Priest,

whose wife was 
Concha,
 sister to 
Saint Martin,
 and both of them the parents of 
Saint Patricke
 the A∣postle
of 
Ireland. Deus
 a most religious Bishop, made this an Archiepiscopall See, remoued from

Is
a Legionum.
 This the 
Britaines
 call 
Tuy Dewy,
 the house of 
Deui;
 we 
Saint Dauids:
 a Citie with
few Inhabitants; yet hath it a faire Cathedrall Church, dedicated to 
Saint Andrew
 and 
Dauid,
 in
the middest of whose Quire lieth intombed 
Edmund
 Earle of 
Richmond,
 father to King 
Henry
 the se∣uenth:
whose Monument (as the 
Prebends
 told me) spared their Church from other defacements,
when all went downe vnder the hammers of King 
Henry
 the eight. About this is a faire wall, and
the Bishops Palace all of free stone, a goodly house I assure you, and of great receit, whose vncoue∣red
tops cause the curious workes in the walles daily to weepe, and them to feare their downefall ere
long.


(8) But 
Monton
 the 
Priorie,
 and S. 
Dogmels,
 places of deuout pietie erected in this Countie,
found not the like fauour, when the commission of their dissolutions came downe against them, and
the axes of destruction cut downe the props of their walles.


(9) This Shire hath beene strengthned with sixteene Castles, besides two 
Block-houses,
 com∣manding
the mouth of 
Mi
ford Hauen,
 and is still traded in fiue Market-Townes, being diuided into
seuen Hundreds, and in them seated one hundred fortie fiue Parish-Churches.













RADNOR-SHIRE.
CHAPTER III.


RADNOR-SHIRE lieth bordered vpon the North with the County 
Monmouth;
 vpon the
East toucheth 
Shropshire
 and 
Herefordshire:
 the Riuers 
Clarwen
 and 
Wye
 diuide it from 
Brek∣nock

in the South: and the West part doth shorten point-wise into 
Caerdigan-shire.


(2) The forme thereof is in proportion triangle, euery side almost containing a like di∣stance:
for from West to North are twentie miles; from North to South, twenty two miles;
and from South to West are twentie foure miles: the whole in circumference extending to foure∣score
and ten miles.


(3) The Aire thereof is sharpe and cold (as most of 
Wales
 is) for that the snow lyeth and la∣steth
long vnmelted vnder those shadowing high Hils and ouer-hanging Rockes.


(4) The Soile is hungry, though not barren, and that in the East and South the best: the other
parts are rough and churlish, and hardly bettered by painfull labour; so that the riches of the North
and West consisteth chiefly in the brood of Cattell.


(5) Anciently this County was possessed by the 
Silures,
 a 
 people, and great withstanders
of the 
Romans
 impositions, who had not onely them to fight against, 
 withall the vnaccessible

Mountaines,
 wherewith this Shire is so ouerpressed and burdened, 
 many times I feared to looke
downe from the hanging 
Rockes,
 whereunder I passed into those deep
 and darke dales, seeming to
me an entrance into 
Limbo.
 Among these (as say our 
Historians)
 that hatefull 
Prince
 to 
God
 and 
Man,
Vortiger,
 his 
Countries
 scourge, and last 
M
narke
 of the 
British bloud,
 by fire from Heauen was consu∣med
with his incestuous wife, for whom 
 nameth the 
Country
 where 
 
Castle
 stood, 
Guarti∣ger-Maur,



of whose rubbish the 
Castle Guthremion
 was raised, as some are of opinion▪ Yet they of

North-Wales
 will haue his destruction and 
Castel
 to stand in their parts 
eere vnto 
Beth-Kelleck,
 where∣of
we will further speake in the relation of his life. Fatall was this place also to 
Llewellin
 the last

Prince
 of the 
British Race,
 who being betrayed by the men of 
Duelth,
 fled into those vast 
Mountaines

of 
Radnor,
 where by 
Adam Francton
 he was slaine, and his head (crowned with 
Iuy)
 set vpon the

Tower
 of 
London.


Places most worthy of note in this Shire, are as ensueth: The first is 
Radnor,
 from whom the

County
 receiueth her 
Name,
 anciently 
Magi,
 where the 
Commander
 of the 
Pacensian Regiment
 lay, and
thought to be the 
Magnos
 in 
Antonine
 the 
emperours Suruey.
 This Towne is pleasantly seated vnder
a hill, whereon standeth mounted a large & strong Castle, from whose 
Bulwarke
 a 
Trench
 is drawne
along the West of the Towne, whereon a wall of stone was once raised, as by the remaines in many
places appeareth. This 
Trench
 doth likewise inuerge her West side so farre as the 
Riuer,
 but after is
no more seene: whose Graduation is obserued to haue the 
Pole
 eleuated for 
Latitude
 52. degrees,
and 45 minutes; and for 
L
ngitude,
 from the first point of the West set by 
Mercator
 17. degrees and
one minute.


Presiayn
 for beautious building is the best in this Shire a Towne of Commerce, wonderfully fre∣quented,
and that very lately▪ Next is 
Knighton,
 a Market-Towne likewise, vnder which is seene
the 
Clawdh-Offa,
 or 
 whose tract for a spa
e I 
 along the edge of the 
Mountaine;

which was a bound 
 the 
Welsh
 from the 
English,
 by the 
Mercian
 King 
Offa:
 and by 
Eg∣bert

the 
Monarke
 a Law 
, by the instigation of his Wife, that it should be present death for the

Welsh
 to passe ouer the same, as 
Iohn Beuer
 the 
Monke
 of 
Westminster
 reporteth: and the like vnder 
Ha∣rald,

as 
Ioha
 of 
Salisbury
 writeth; wherein it was ordained, that what 
Welsh-man
 soeuer should be
found with any weapon on this side of that 
Limit,
 which was 
Offaes Ditch,
 should haue his right


hand cut off by the 
Kings Officers.
 The fourth place for account is 
Raihader Gowy,
 who besides the
great fall of 
Wye
 with a continuall noise, hath her Markets there kept vpon the 
Sabbath,
 which I
there obserued, and here note for an offence.


(7) Many 
Riuers
 arise and run thorow this 
Shire,
 which were it not that the hils so cluster toge∣ther,
might make the soyle both fertile and fat. Such are 
Teme, Lug, Ithon, Clowdok, Dulas, Comarton,
Somegill, Guithel, Arro, Machaway, Edway, Hawye, Eland, Clarwen
 and 
Wye,
 besides other 
Loughs

that stand betwixt the hilles.


This 
Shire
 is diuided into sixe 
Hundreds,
 wherein are seated three 
Forrests,
 foure 
Market-Townes,

sixe 
Castles,
 and fiftie two 
Parish-Chrches.








BREKNOCK-SHIRE.
CHAPTER IIII.


BREKNOCK-SHIRE, in the 
British
 language 
Brechineau,
 (so called, as the 
Welshmen
 relate,
of a Prince named 
Brechanius,
 the father of an holy 
off-spring,
 whose twentie foure daughters
were all of them Saints) is a County neither very large, not greatly to be praysed or disliked
of, whose bounds vpon the North is parted from 
Radnor
 with the Riuers 
Clarwen
 and 
Wye:
 the
West lieth butted vpon by 
Cardigan
 and 
Caermarden-shires:
 the South is confined by 
Glamor∣gan;

and the East with 
Monmouth
 and 
Radnor-shire,
 is wholly bound.


(2) The length of this Shire from North to South, betwixt 
Llanuth
 and 
Istradgunies,
 are twen∣tie
eight 
English
 miles; and her bredth from East to West, extended betwixt 
Fentrisso
 and 
E
ywell,

are twentie miles; the whole in circumference, about one hundred and two miles.


This County is full of hils, and vneuen for trauell, which on the South part mount in such
height, that as
 Giraldus 
hath written,
 They make the aire much colder, and defend the Country from the
excessiue heat of the Sunne, whereby acertaine naturall whole 
 of aire maketh it most temperate: and
on the East side, the Mountaines of Edgar and Ewias doe as 
 were fore-fence the same. 
Among which,
there arise and run so many fruite springs that their vallies are thereby made most fertile, yeelding
in plentie both Corne and Grasse.


(4) The ancient Inhabitants and possessors of this Shire, with the rest in this South Tract, were
the 
Silures,
 much spoken of, and gr
at opposites to the 
Romanes,
 whose Countries were first made
subiect by 
Iulius Froutinus, who besi
s the valour of the enemy, had to struggle with the Mountaines and
Straits,
 as 
Tacitus
 tels vs; neither any more hard, we may well say, then them of this Shire; where∣of


one in the South, and three miles from 
Breknock,
 is of such height and operation, as is vncredi∣ble:
and were it not that I haue witnesse to affirme what I shall speake, I should blush to let the re∣port
thereof passe from my pen: In my perambulations in these parts, remaining in 
Breknock
 to ob∣serue
the site of that Towne, the Aldermen or chiefe Seniors thereof regarding my paines, with
friendly and courteous entertainments at my departure, no lesse then eight of them, that had beene
Bailiffes of the Towne, came to visit me; where they reported vpon their credit and trials, that
from the top of that hill, in the 
Welsh
 called 
Mounch-denny,
 or 
Cadier Arthur,
 they had oftentimes
cast from them, and downe the North-East Rocke, their Cloakes, Hats, and Staues, which not∣withstanding
would neuer fall, but were with the aire and winde still returned backe, and blowne vp:
neither, said they, will any thing descend from that Cliffe being so cast, vnlesse it be stone or some
metalline substance: affirming the cause to be the Clouds, which are seene to racke much lower
then the top of that Hill. As strange tales are told of the 
Meer Llynsauathan,
 two miles by East from

Breknock,
 which at the breaking of her frozen I
e, maketh a fearefull sound like vnto thunder. In
which place, as is reported, sometimes stood afaire Citie, which was swallowed vp in an Earth∣quake,
and resigned her stone-wals vnto this deepe and 
 water: whither vnto this day leadeth
all the wayes in this Shire: which, as le
ed 
Cambdin
 
ctureth, might be that 
Louentrium,
 which

Ptolemy
 in this tract placeth; and the most confirmed 
 name adioyning, being also cal∣led

Leuenny,
 which Riuer also passeth through this 
 the same streame, and no greater
then wherewith she first entred in.


(5) The Townes for Commerce, are 
Hay, Bealt,
 and 
Breknock,
 two of them vnfortunate of their
former greatnesse, whom warres and sedition haue defaced a
 least downe. 
Hay
 vpon 
Wye
 and 
Du∣las,

pleasant for situation, in the rebellion of 
Owen Glendower
 
 was diswalled, depopulated, and






burnt, in whose foundations for new repaires, many 
Romane
 Coines haue beene found; and there∣by
thought to be the seate of their Legions: and 
Buelth,
 now 
Bealt,
 though of good frequencie, yet
not so great as when 
Ptolemie
 obserued her position for graduation, who calleth it 
Buleum Silurum,

neither when it with the Country was possessed by 
Aurelius Ambrosius,
 by whose permission 
Pas∣centius

the sonne of 
Vortiger
 ruled all, as 
Ninius
 writeth; nor yet as of later times, when 
Leolin
 the
last Prince of the 
Britaines,
 was therein betrayed and slaine.


(6) 
Breknock
 the Shire-Towne, for buildings and beautie retaineth a better regard, whose walles
in Ouall-wise are both strong and of good repaire, hauing three Gates for entrance, with tenne
Towres for defence, and is in circuit six hundred and fortiepaces about, vpon whose west part a most
sumptuous and stately Castle is seated, the like whereof is not commonly seene, whose decayes ap∣proaching
doe increase her ruines daily, and in the end is feared will be her fall▪ This Towne is seated
vpon the meeting of two Riuers, 
Houthy
 and 
Vske,
 whose yearely gouernment is committed to two
Bailiffes, fifteene Aldermen, two Chamberlaines, two Constables a Towne-Clerke, and two Ser∣geants
their Attendants: hauing the Poles eleuation in 52▪ 21. minutes of Latitude, and for Longi∣tude
is placed in the 16. and 32. minutes, as the Mathematicians doe measure them.


(7) This Shire is strengthned with 
ine Castles, diuided into sixe Hundreds, wherein are sea∣ted
three Market-Townes, and fiftie 
 Parish-Churches.








CARDIGAN-SHIRE.
CHAPTER V.


CARDIGAN-SHIRE, (in the 
Welsh
 called 
Sire Aber-Tiui)
 is parted on the North from

Merioneth-shire
 with the Riuer 
Doui;
 by the 
Plinillimon
 hilles from 
Montgomery-shire
 in part
of her East; and the rest from 
Breknock-shire,
 with the water 
Towy;
 and with 
Tyuy
 altogether
on the South from 
Caermarden-shire:
 the West is wholly washed with the 
Irish Sea.


(2) The forme thereof is horne-like, bowing compasse, long and narrow, and growing
wider still towards the North: so that from 
Cardigan,
 the Shire-Towne and vttermost point: in the
South, vnto the Riuer 
Doui,
 her farthest North bounder, are thirtie two miles: and from the head of

Carwen
 in the East, to 
Aberysthwyth
 on her West, the broadest part in the Shire, are onely fifteene:
the whole in circumference is one hundred and three miles.


(3) The Aire is open and somewhat piercing; the soyle is hillie, and 
(Wales
-like) vneuen: yet
more plaine and champion towards the Sea, then in the East or North of the Land. For besides
that great and high hill called 
Plinil
on,
 a continuall range of lesser doth shoote along, yeelding in
their vallies both goodly rich Pastures, and very large Pooles, which being assisted with Springs
from the Rockes, doe branch themselues, as veines in the bod
 
 make fruitfull their passages
vnto the Sea. In 
Tyuy
 one of these, as 
Giraldus
 
 
Beauer
 hath beene found, a crea∣ture
liuing both by land and water, whose stones the 
 in great price. His fore-feete
are like vnto a dogge, but the hinder whole skinne, as is the 
 the dogge-like serue him on
shore for to run; and the Goose-like as Oraes giue him swift 
 in swimming: this taile broad
and gristly, he vseth as a sterne, wherewith on the sudden 
 diuert his swift floating course.


But this creature in these parts a long time hath not beene seene, whose roome we may well say the

Salmon
 hath possessed, who still coueting into fresh water Riuers, at their downe-right falles vseth
this policie: He bendeth himselfe backward, and taketh his taile in his mouth, and with all his
strength vnloosing his circle on the sudden (as a lath let goe) mounteth vp before the fall of the
streame; whereupon such water-falles are called the 
Salmons leape:
 and in these Riuers many such

Salmons
 are caught.


(4) The commodities of this Shire chiefly consist in Cattle, Sea-sowle, and Fish; Corne suffi∣cient,
but of Woods some scarcitie: and at the head of 
Istwyd
 are certaine veines of Lead, a mer∣chandize
of no meane regard or wealth.


(5) The ancient people that possessed this Prouince, were the 
Dimetae,
 by 
Ptolemie
 branched
thorow the Tracts of 
Caermarden, Penbrooke,
 and this Shire; who in their struglings against the 
Ro∣mans,

did not a little relie vpon 
Caractacus
 their most warlike King, (from whose name, though vn∣likely,
some will haue the Shire called 
Cardigan)
 yet lastly felt the fortune of subiection with the
rest, when 
Iulius Frontinus
 warred with these Mountaines. Scarce had the 
Normans
 setled their King∣dome
in 
Britaine,
 but that they assailed this Countie, as well to enioy so farre a Possession, as to se∣cure
those Seas from any inuasion against them: so that 
Rufus
 first wrested from the 
Welshmen
 the
maritime Coasts, and 
Henry
 the first gaue the whole Countie to 
Gilbert de
 
.


(6) This 
Gi
bert
 fortified 
 the Shire-Towne, with a Wall and strong Castle, whose a∣ged
lineaments doe to this day 
 industry both of nature and Art: for the Towne is seated
vpon a steepe banke, her South 
 guarded with the deepe Riuer 
Tyny,
 and passable no way but by
a bridge vnder the Castle. They 
 taketh the aduantage of the rising rocks, and circulate the Towne
euen round about. The Castle is 
gher built vpon a Rocke, both spatious and faire, had not stormes
impaired her beautie, and time 
 her carkasse a very Anatomie. The walles range as thou seest,


and are indifferent for repaire, hauing three wayes for entrance, and containe in compasse six hun∣dred
and fourescore pases: whose position for Latitude is set in the degree 52. 33 minutes from the
North-pole, and for Longitude from the first West-point by 
Mercator,
 in the degree 15. and 10. minutes.


(7) This Shire, as it is little in circuit, so accordingly is besprinkled with Towne-ships, whereof
foure onely haue the trade of Markets: neither finde I other remembrance of religious foundations,
but at 
Cardigan, Istradfleet,
 and at 
Llan-Badern-Vaur,
 where sometimes was seated an Episcopall See,
which (as 
Houeden
 writeth) 
was decayed many yeares since, when the people had wickedly slaine their Pa∣stour.

And yet 
Llan-Deui-breui,
 built, and so called in memory of the most famous 
Dauid
 Bishop of

Meneura,
 was in great esteeme, where in a frequent Synod there holden, he refuted the 
Pelagian He∣resie,

sprung vp againe in 
Britaine,
 both by the authoritie of holy Scripture, and also by miracle, as
is reported, while the earth whereon he stood and preached, rose vp vnto a certaine height vnder
his feet▪


(8) The Shires diuision, for businesses belonging either to the Crowne or Common-wealth,
is into fiue Hundreds, wherein are seated for 
, and sixtie foure Parish-Churches
for Gods diuine and daily seruice.








CAERMARDEN-SHIRE.
CHAPTER VI.


CAERMARDEN-SHIRE, so called from the chiefe Towne 
Caermarden,
 lieth bordered
vpon the North with 
Cardigan-shire;
 vpon her East, by 
Brecknock
 and 
Glamorgan-shires;
 vpon
the South, with a Bay of the 
British Seas;
 and vpon the West with 
Pembroke-shire.


(2) The forme of this County is long, and shooteth it selfe from the South-west into the
North and by-East, betwixt whose furthest bounds are thirtie fiue 
English
 miles, and in her
broadest part twentie miles; the whole in circumferance about one hundred and two miles.


(3) This Shire is not altogether so pestred with hils as her bordering neighbours are: and those
that she hath, neither so high nor so thicke, and therefore is better for Corne and Pasturage, yea
and in Woods also, so that for victuals this Countie is very well stored, which the stomacke doth as
well disgest, the aire being wholesome, temperate, and pleasing▪


(4) Anciently these parts were possessed by the 
Di
tree,
 as 
Ptolemie, Gildas,
 and 
Ninius
 doe name
them: though 
Plinie
 holds opinion that they were part of the 
Silures,
 with whom no doubt they
were subdued to the 
Romans
 yoke by 
, when he struggled with the rockie hils in those
Southerne parts And this Countie is 
 by Writers to be the very strength of 
South Wales.

In the West thereof, at 
Kilman
 (as it 
 seeme) their Legions kept, where lately an ear∣then
Po
 hoarded with store of 
 
Coines,
 was by the spade digged vp, being stamped vpon im∣based
siluer, from the time of 
Co
odus
 vnto the first 
Tribuneship
 of 
Gordian
 the third, which fell in
the yeare of Christ two hundred 
tie three: and amongst these were the Coines of 
Heluins Perti∣nax,
Marcu
 Opellius, Antonius Di
menianus, Iulius Verus Maximus,
 the sonne of 
Maximu
,
 of 
Calius


Balbinus,
 of 
Clodius Pupienus,
 of 
Aquilta Senera,
 the wife of 
Helingaba
,
 and of 
Sall-Barbia Orbi
∣na,

peeces rarely found.


(5) The commodities of this Shire chiefly consist in 
Cattle, Pit-coale, Fowle,
 and 
Sea-fish,
 where∣of
the 
Salmon
 is common among them, and that of such greatnesse and plentie, as no place is better
furnished therewith then the Shire-Towne 
Caermarden
 is.


(6) Which Towne by 
Ptolemie
 is called 
Maridunum;
 by 
Antonius
 the Empe
our, 
M
ridunum;

by the 
Britaines, Caer-fridhin;
 and by vs, 
Caermarden.
 It is pleasantly seated vpon the South-west
side of the Riuer 
Touy,
 that runneth thorow the middest of this Shire, and falleth South from hence
into the 
British Sea,
 where before times was a conuenient Hauen for Ships 
, but now is sore
pestred with Sands and Shelfes: notwithstanding some small Vessels ascend vp the Riuer, euen vn∣to
the Bridge of this Towne, which is fairely built of free-stone. And ouer the same, vpon a han∣ging
Rocke, standeth a very large Castle, from whose stone-wall another intermingled with bricke
rangeth about the Towne, being in circuit one thousand and foure hundred pases. The Inhabi∣tants
of this place doe not a little glory of their 
Merlin
 who (at they say) was therein borne, the
sonne of a bad Angell, or of an 
Incubus
 spirit, the 
 great 
Apollo,
 whom 
Geffrey ap Arthur

would ranke with the 
South saying Seer,
 or rathe
 
 true Prophets themselues; being none o∣ther
then a meere Seducer and phantasticall Wizard. 
 howsoeuer 
Alani de Insulis
 in his Com∣mentaries
hath labourered to vnlocke those darke and hidden 
, wherewith his booke is pe∣stred
and full, yet was it not without cause forbid the reading by 
 
Councell
 of 
Trent,
 as vaine, and
not worthy of countenance or credit.


At the entrance of the 
Normans,
 this Towne was brought vn
 their obedience, and for a long
time was distressed with the calamities of warre, yet afterwards it is made by the 
English
 Princes the

Chaucdry
 and 
Exchequer
 for all 
South-Wales:
 and at this day is yearely gouerned by a 
Maior,
 who


euer after is an 
Alderman
 and Iustice of the Peace, two 
Sheriffes
 elected out of sixteene 
Burgesses,

all of them in skarlet, a 
Sword-bearer,
 a 
Towne-Clerke,
 and two 
Sergeants
 with 
Maces:
 from whence
the 
Pole
 is raised 52. degrees 15. minutes in Latitude, and for Longitude is in the degree 15. and 30.
minutes from the first point in the West, according to 
Mercator.


(7) East from this place are the ruines of 
Carreg-Castle,
 which stood mounted on a high hill, vn∣der
the which many vaults and spacious Caues farre into the ground are seene, wherein is thought
the people vnable to fight, were therein secured in time of their Warres. Where also is a Well (take
the report from 
Giraldus,
 who writeth it) 
that in this place twice in foure and twentie houres ebbing,
and twice flowing, resembleth the vnstable motions of the maine Sea.


(8) This Shire is watered with twentie eight Riuers and Riuerets of name, strengthned with ten
Castles, traded in sixe Market-Townes, diuided into sixe Hundreds, wherein are seated fourescore
and seauen Parish-Churches.













GLAMORGAN-SHIRE.
CHAPTER VII.


GLAMORGAN-SHIRE, as some thinke, named from Prince 
Morgan
 the possessor there∣of,
or according to others, is taken from 
Morgan
 an Abbey, founded by 
William
 Earle of

Glocester,
 vpon the Sea-shoare in the South of this Shire, lyeth bounded vpon that part al∣together
with the 
British Sea;
 the West by 
Loghor,
 is parted from 
Caermarden-shire;
 the North
butteth vpon the Countie of 
Brekn
ck;
 and the East by 
Remney
 is diuided from 
Monmouth.


(2) The forme of this Shire groweth still wider from her West-point, spreaking her broadest
touch in the East, betwixt which extreames I finde by measure to be well-neere fortie 
English
 miles,
and from North to South, not altogether twentie miles: the whole in circumference, about one
hundred and twelue miles.


(3) The aire is temperate, and giues mo
ntent to the minde, then the soile doth fruit or ease
vnto Trauellers. The hils being high and 
, which from the North notwithstanding are
lessened as it were by degrees; and towards 
 Sea-coasts, the Country becommeth somewhat
plaine, which part is the best both for plentie
 Graine, and populous of Inhabitants. The rest all
Mountaine, is replenished with 
 which is the best meanes vnto wealth that this Shire doth af∣foord;
vpon whose Hils you may 
hold whole Heards of them feeding; and from whose Rockes,
most cleare springing waters 
 the vallies trickling, which sportingly doe passe with a most
pleasant sound, and did not a little 
 my wearied spirits among those vast Mountaines, imployed
in their search: whose infancie at first admitted an easie step ouer; but growne vnto strength, more
boldly forbade me such passage, and with a more sterne countenance held on their iourney vnto the

British Seas:
 and 
Taue
 among these is accounted for a chiefe.



(4) Vpon whose fall, and East-banke, the fairest Towne of all 
South-Wales
 is seated the 


Caerdid,
 the 
English Caerdiffe,
 which 
Fitz-Haimon
 fortified with a Wall and Castle, in the raigne of
King 
Rufus,
 when he and his 
Norman Knights
 had ouercome 
Rhese
 the Prince of these parts, and
thrust out 
Iestine
 from his lawfull possession. This Towne he made his owne Seat and Court of
Iustice, enioyning his Consorts to giue ayde to this honour, and to hold their portions in vassallage
of him. Strong was the Castle, as by the trust therein reposed may well appeare, where the youngest
brother 
Beautlark
 kept captiue the eldest 
Curthose,
 both of them sonnes to the Conquerour, the space
of twentie sixe yeares. This Castle is large, and in good repaire, whence the Towne-wall went
both South and East to the Riuers side, thorow which, foure Gates enter into the foure windes, and
containe in compasse nine hundred and twentie pases; and along the Riuer (a sure defence) vpon
her West side, three hundred more; so that the Towne containeth in circuit twelue hundred and
fourescore pases. But as the 
Taue
 is a friend to the Towne, in making a Key for arriuage of shipping;
so is she a foe to S. 
Maries
 Church in the South, with vndermining her foundations, and threatning
her fall. The Towne is gouerned by a Maior, yearely elected out of twelue Aldermen, assisted with
other twelue Burgesses, a Towne-Clerke, foure C
stables, and two Sergeants with Maces: whose
site is obserued from the North-Starre to lie in the degree of Latitude, 51. and 49. scruples; and
from the first point in the West, 16. and 53 scrup
.


(5) In the same graduation almost is sited the 
itie 
Landaf,
 wherein is a Castle and Cathedrall
Church, dedicated to S. 
Telean,
 Bishop of the same, without any other memorable matter worthy the
speaking of.


(6) 
But things of strange note are these, by the report of
 
aldus, 
who affirmeth that
 in a Rocke
or Cliffe vpon the Sea side, and Iland Barry, lying neere the South-
st point of this County, is beard out of
a little Chinke 
(let him take heed what he saith)
 the noise as it 
 of Smiths at their worke; one whiles


the blowing of Bellowes to increase the heat, then the stroakes of the Hammer, and sound of the 
; some∣times
the noise of the Grind-stone in grinding of Iron tooles; then the hissing sparkes of Steele-gads, as they flie
from their beating, with the puffing noise of flames in a Furnace. 
And whether this is the place whereof

Clemens Alexandrinus 
speaketh, I determine not; where in his writings he hath these words:
 They
that haue recorded Histories 
(saith he)
 doe say that in the Ile of Britaine, there is a certaine Hole or Ca
e
vnder the bottome of an Hill, and on the top thereof a gaping Chinke, into the which when the winde is gathe∣red,
and tossed to and fro
 in the wombe or concauitie thereof, there is heard aboue, a sound of Cymbals: for
the winde being driuen backe from his hole, is forced to make a loud sound at her vent.


(7) More Westward from hence, vpon the Riuer 
Ogmore,
 and neere vnto 
Newton,
 in a sandie
plaine about an hundred pases from 
Seuerne,
 there springeth a Well, though not of the clearest water,
where at the flowing and fulnesse of the Sea, can hardly any water be gotten; but at the ebbe and
fall of tyde it walloweth vp amaine. The cause may be, as 
Polybius
 reports of the like at 
Cadys;
Wherein the windie ayre, when it is depriued of his wonted issues, forcibly returneth, shutting and stopping
vp the passages and veines of the Spring, whereby 
 waters are kept in. But contrariwise, when the sur∣face
thereof is void and emptie of water, the vein
 of the Source or Spring are vnstopped and set free, which
then boileth vp in great abundance.


(8) And vpon the same shoare more 
 and by West, on the top of a hill called 
Minyd-Margan,

is erected a Monument inscribed wit
 strange Character, and as strange a conceit held
thereof by the by-dwellers, whose opinions are possessed, that if any man reade the same, he shall
shortly after die.


This Shire, as it is the furthest 
 of 
South-Wales,
 and lay open to forraine inuasion; so was is
fortified with twentie-fiue stronge. Castles, whereof times and stormes haue deuoured the most:
such were 
Barry, Saint Doneitis, Den
owis, Morlashe, Menes
e, Logho
, Llanddeny, Llanquian, Oxwich,


Oystermouth, Ognior, Pile, Porkery, Pe
arth, Winston, Newcastle, Caerfly, Coche, Peullys, 
,
Kenfeage, Talla
, Treer
 and 
Cothy.


Neither was the Countie so ill seated for sufficiency of life, or barren of graine, but that therein
were planted places for diuine pietie: such were 
Neath, Margan,
 and 
Caerdif,
 besides the Episcopall
See of 
Landa
:
 which last still remaineth; the other three suppressed among the fall of their like, vn∣der
King 
Henry
 the eight.


This Shire is diuided into ten Hundreds, wherein are seated ssixe Market-Townes, and one hun∣dred
and eighteene Parish-Churches.













MONMOVTH-SHIRE.
CHAPTER VIII.


MONMOVTH-SHIRE, from 
Monmouth
 Towne, and that from 
Mounowe
-water bearing
name, is altogether inclosed on the North, and is separated from 
Hereford-shire
 with the
same Riuer, vpon the East both it and 
Wye
 diuides this County from 
Glocester-shire.
 The
South-side wholly is washed by the 
Seuerne Sea;
 and some of her West part by 
Rempney
 is
parted from 
Glamorgan,
 and the rest lyeth bordered vpon by 
Breknock-shire.


(2) The forme thereof is Scallop-wise, both long and broad, shooting her North point to

Llantony,
 and her South to the fall of 
Rempney,
 betwixt which two are twentie foure English miles:
and from 
Chepstowe
 East, to 
Blanagwent
 West, are not altogether nineteene miles: the whole in circuit
draweth somewhat neere to seauentie seauen miles.


(3) The Ayre is temperate, healthfull an
 
, the soile is hilly, wooddy and rich, all places
fruitfull, but no place barren. The Hils are 
 vpon by Cattle and Sheepe, the Vallies are laden
with Corne and Grasse, neuer vngratefull of 
 bandmans paines, nor makes frustrate his hope
of expected increase; whose springs abundantly 
sing in this Countie with many streames, doe fat∣ten
the soile euen from side to side.


(4) Anciently the 
Sil
es
 inhabited this Shire, whose chiefe Citie by the Emperour 
Antonine
 is
named 
Venta Silarum,
 by the 
Welsh Caer-went,
 and was by 
Tath
 the 
British
 Saint, made an 
Academi
,

and a diuine place for worship. So like wise 
Caer-lion
 now, once 
Isca,
 was, where the second 
Roman

Legion called 
Augusta
 lay, as by their Coines, Altars, Tables, and Inscriptions there found, and
daily therein digged vp, doth euidently appeare.



By the report of 
Giraldus,
 in this Citie was the Court of great 
Arthur,
 whither the 
Romane
 Em∣bassadours
resorted vnto him, and as 
Alexander Elsebinsis
 writeth, therein was a Schoole of two
hundred Philosophers, skilfull in 
Astronomie
 and other Arts. Which is the more credible, for that

A
phibalus,
 S. 
Albans
 instructer, was therein borne, and 
Iulius
 and 
Aaron,
 two noble 
Proto-Mar∣tyrs

of great 
Britaine,
 in this Citiereceiued the Crowne of 
Martyrdome,
 where their bodies were also
interred. But as all things finde their fatall period, so this Citie for beautie, circuit, and magnificall
respect is laid in the ruines of her owne decay; neither may any more lament the losse of glory then

Munmouths
 Castle, which captiue-like doth yeeld to conquering Time. Her downe-cast stones
from those lostie turrets, doe shew what beautie once it bare, standing mounted round in compasse,
and within her wals another mount, whereon a Towre of great height and strength is built, which
was the birth-place of our Conquering 
Henry,
 the great Triumpher ouer 
France,
 but now decayed,
and from a Princely Castle, is become no better then a regardlesse Cottage. In this Towne a beau∣tifull
Church built with three Iles is remaining, and at the East end a most curiously built (but now
decayed) Church stands, called the 
Monkes
-
 In the Monastery whereof, our great Anti∣quarie

Geffrey,
 surnamed 
Munmouth,
 and 
Ap
 
 his History of 
Great Britaine
 whose
paines as they were both learned and great, so 
 bred great paines among the learned both
to defend and to disproue. The Townes situation is pleasant and good, seated betwixt the Riuers

Monnowe
 and 
Wye:
 three Gates yet stand, besides that Tower or Locke of the Bridge, and a Trench
or tract of wall running betwixt the 
on each side downe to the Riuer, containing in circuit about
eight hundred paces. The Towne is 
 good repayre, and well frequented, gouerned by a Maior,
two Bailiffes, fifteene Common Councellers, a Towne-Clerke, and two Sergeants for their At∣tendance.
It is in Latitude remoued from the Equator 52. degrees and 8. minutes, and from the
West point of Longitude is set in the degree 17. 36. minutes.



Religious Houses erected and suppressed in this Shire, for greatest account haue beene in C
∣
on,

Chepstow, Gold-cliffe, Munmouth
 and 
Llantony;
 which last stood so solitary, and among hils, that
the Sunne was not seene to shine there, but onely betwixt the houres of one and three.


This Shire is strengthened with fourteene Castles, traded with six Market-Townes, diuided into
six Hundreds, wherein are situated one hundred twentie and seauen Parish-Churches, and is not ac∣counted
among the 
Welsh-shires,
 being subdued by 
Henry
 the second, who passing the 
Naut Pen-carne,

a small Brooke and of no danger, yet held fatall by the 
Welsh,
 ouer credulous to a Prophecy of 
Merlin
Siluester
 the 
British Apollo,
 who had foreshewed that when a-stout and frecled fac'd King (such as

Henry
 was) should passe ouer that Ford, then the power of the 
Welshmen
 should be brought vnder;
whereby their stout courage was soone abated, and the whole Countie the sooner in subiection to
the 
English.














MOVNTGOMERY-SHIRE
CHAPTER IX.


MOVNTGOMERY-SHIRE, in the 
British
 speech called 
, and that of the
principall Towne 
Mountgomery,
 lyeth bounded vpon the North with 
Denbigh-shire,
 vpon
the East with 
Shrop-shire,
 on the South with 
Ra
or
 and 
Cardigan-shires,
 and on the West
with 
Merioneth-shire.


(2) In forme it somewhat resembleth a Peare or Pine-apple, as it were growing out
of the West, and rising thence with many high Hilles and plentifull Spring
 which water and make
fruitfull the Soyle query where▪ whose searching rilles with a longing desire haste euer forward to
finde an increase, and to 
 thei
 growth into a bigger body whereof the 
S
uerne
 is the chiefe
and the second Riuer in the Land: whose head rising from the spired mountaine 
Plymillimon,
 run∣neth
not farre without the receits of other riuer
 into her streame, and with many wings doth
spore her selfe thorow all the East part of this Shire.


(3) That this Riuer tooke her name from 
, the beautifull 
 daughter of 
 begot∣ten
out of wedlock vpon 
Estrildi
 the daughter of 
 the 
 King, 
rinuaded this Land,
and both of them drowned in this Riuer by 
Guen
lena
 King 
 
uiuing widow: let 

relate, and Poets enlarge, whereof one among them in good account, thus writeth:

—In 
 pracipitatur Abren,


Nomen Abren 
 de Virgine, 






Into this streame faire 
Abren
 head-long cast,


Gaue name of 
Abren
 to those waters wast,


Corruptly call'd 
Sabrina
 now at last.


(4) This Riuer maketh the East part of this Shire for fruitfulnesse to be compared with most of
the Land, and to exceed any other Shire in 
Wales:
 the West side is more hilly and lesse inhabited, yet
surely those mountaines breed innumerable of Cattle, especially of horses, whose portraiture for ma∣king
and incomparable swiftnesse, 
Giraldus Cambrensis
 Arch-deacon of 
Breknocke
 doth greatly com∣mend.


(5) The ancient Inhabitants that were seated in 
Gwineth
 and 
Powisland,
 whereof this Shire was
a part, were to the 
Romanes
 knowne by the name of ORDOVICES, a puissant and couragious
Nation, whose hearts and hilles held them the longest free from the yoke of subiection, either of the

Romans
 or 
English.
 for vnto the dayes of 
Domitian,
 they kept plea with the 
Romans,
 
 were not brought
to the will of the 
English
 before the raigne of King 
Edward
 the first. Those 
ORDOVICES
 inhabi∣ted
the Counties of 
Mountgomery, Merioneth, Caer
, Denbigh,
 and 
Fl
t,
 which are of vs called
now 
North-Wales,
 a people generous and of affable
 
, goodly for feature, faire of com∣plexion,
couragious of minde, courteous to strangers, and that which is most commendable, most
true and loyall to the 
English
 Crowne.


Townes for Trades and commerce in this Countie are fix the chiefest thereof and Shire-Towne
is 
Mountgomery,
 very wholesome for ayre, and pleasant for situation, vpon an easie ascent of an hill,
and vpon another farre higher mounted, stands a faire and well-repaired Castle, from the East Rocke
whereof, the Towne hath beene walled, as by some part yet standing, and the tract and trench of
the rest euen vnto the North-side of the said Castle, may euidently be seene: whose graduation for


Latitude is placed in the degree 53. and for Longitude 17. the lines cutting each other in the site of
this Towne.


This Towne hath lately receiued the honour and Title of an Earledome, whereof 
Philip Herbert

the second sonne of 
Henry
 Earle of 
Pembroke,
 was created the first, in 
Anno
 1605. And the Shire
diuided into seauen Hundreds, wherein are seated sixe Market-Townes, and fortie seauen Parish-Churches.








MERIONETH-SHIRE.
CHAPTER X.


MERIONETH-SHIRE, which the 
Britaines
 call 
Sira-Verieneth,
 and in 
Latine Mer
i∣nia;

is bordered vpon the North by 
Carnar
on
 and 
Denbigh-shires,
 vpon the East with

Mongomery,
 vpon the South by the Riuer 
Dowy,
 is parted from 
Cardigan-shire,
 and the
West side altogether washed with the 
Irish Seas,
 whose rage with such vehemency beateth
against her bankes, that it is thought and said, some quantitie of the Land hath beene
swallowed vp by those Seas.


(2) In forme this Shire somewhat resembleth a 
Welsh-Harpe,
 though small is the Musicke that to
her Inhabitants she makes, being the roughest, and most vnpleasant to see to (as 
Giraldus
 their
owne 
Historian
 writeth) in all 
Wales.
 The ayre for great pleasure, nor soyle for great profit, I can∣not
greatly commend, vnlesse it be for the many and mightie great winds, that for the most part
therein doe rage, and the spired hils clustered together so neere and so high, as the same 
Author
 af∣firmeth,
that Shepheards vpon their tops falling at oddes in the morning and challenging the field
for fight, before they can come together to try out the quarrell, the day will be spent, and the heate
of their fury shut vp with their sleepe,


(3) These mountaines formerly did abound with 
Wolues,
 for whose auoydeance 
Hdgar
 the peace∣able,
did impose (as 
Malmesbury
 writeth) a yearely Tribute of three hundred 
Wolues,
 vpon 
Lud∣wall

Prince of that Country, whereby in three yeares space they were quite destroyed: and now
their faces are couered with fruitfull flockes of Sheepe, besides Neate and other Cattell that therein
abundantly doe grase, wherein the onely riches of this Shire doth consist: for by reason of the vn∣euennesse


of the soile and rocks so noere the face of the earth, the Plough cannot be 

Corne prosper, which some haue imputed to the idlenesse of the Inhabitants, wherein they haue
beene greatly wronged.


(4) These people are a part of the 
Ordonices,
 of whom we haue spoken, who by the aduantage
of these mountaines held out with the longest against the 
Romanes,
 and their necks not brought vn∣der
the yoke of bondage, before the dayes of King 
Edward
 the first; since when they haue attempted
to east off their subiection to the 
English,
 vpon whose stirres raised by 
Owin Glendouer,
 who hauing
beene a fauorite of King 
Richard
 the second, and discontented by King 
Henry
 the fourth, in a quar∣rell
with the Lord 
Grey
 of 
Ruthin,
 that intruded vpon his demaines, quarrelled with the King, and
entred into open rebellion and confederacie with all other his rebels, drawing the 
Welsh-men
 wholly
to his side, in hope to haue had Princes restored of their owne bloud: and he maintained the same
with wonderfull pride, policie, and obstinacie for a long time, vntill his consederates followers and
fauorates, and his owne courage, credit, and maintenance, were brought so low by that powerfull
King, that in the end he perished for very want of food.


(5) Their Townes are not many, neither those that they haue of any stately buildings, whereof

Bala, 
olgethe,
 and 
Harlech
 are the Marke
: 
 in the North-east of this Countie, in the 
Welsh


, in 
English, Pi
le-meane,
 a great poole of water doth drowne at least eight score Acres
of ground: whose 
 the high land flouds though neuer so great,
cannot 
 bigger by their 
 but if the 
 be
oubled with ouer great blasts
and tempests of wi
des, she in as great a rage riseth and passeth her bankes, as if she would encoun∣ter
that enemy in fight Into the South whereof the two headed 
Dee
 with a pretie sharpe streame en∣treth,
and thorow the same glideth without any mixture of the same water, as the Inhabitants be∣leeue;
more strongly conceited in their opinion for that the 
Salmon,
 vsually taken in 
Dee,
 is neuer


found in that Poole; and the fish called 
Guimad,
 bred in that 
Meart,
 neuer is seene in the Riuer-
Dee.

South thence neere 
Dolgelhr,
 in a lower hill, a great Rampire of stone and compasse is seene, and
hath beene some fortification or defence in warre: which whilst we were curious to finde out some
instructions thereof, by report this onely we learned, that it was called 
Caddoryrita Dren,
 according
to the name of her neighbour and farre higher hill.


(6) Vpon the West and Sea-shore of this Shire, 
Harlech
 a Market and Major Towne standeth,
bleake enough and barren, but onely for Fowle and Fish; houses not many, neither curiously built,
wherein standeth a little Chappell decayed and without vse, in which lyeth buryed Sir 
Richard
Thimblebye,
 an 
English
 Knight, who for the delight he tooke in that game, remoued his abode
from a farre better soyle. Here also standeth a most strong and beautifull Castle, mounted vpon
a hill, and with a double Bulwarke walled about, commanding the Sea, and passage of entrance
of such as seeke to inuade the Goast: And surely a great pitie it is to see so faire a worke fall to de∣cay:
the Constable whereof by 
Patent
 is euer the Major of this Towne; neere vnto which are two
great Inlets of Seas, which at low water may be passed vpon the Sands with Guides. Vpon whose
shore, as vpon the Sea-coasts in this Countie, abundance of 
Herrings
 are caught, for which cause
they are much frequented in the season of the yeare, by many people from diuers Countries.


(7) This Towne being the chiefest of the Shire, the Pole shall be eleuated onely from thence,
whose height for Latitude standeth in the degree 53. 29. minutes, and for Longitude in the 15. 47.
minutes. The whole being diuided into sixe Hundreds, wherein are seated thirtie seauen Parish-Churches.













DENBIGH-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XI.


DENBIGH-SHIRE, called in 
Welsh, Sire Denbigh,
 retyring more from the Sea within the
Countrey, on this side of the Riuer 
Conwey
 shooteth Eastward in one place as farre as to the
Riuer 
Dee:
 on the North, first the Sea (for a small space) and then 
Plint-shire
 encompasseth
it: on the West, 
Caernaruon
 and 
Merioneth-shire;
 on the East, 
Cheshire
 and 
Shrop-shire;
 and on
the South, 
Mountgomery-shire▪


(2) The forme thereof is long, growing wider still towards the North-west, and narrower
towards the East It is in length from East to West, one and thirtie miles, and in bredth from North
to South, seauenteene miles: in the whole circuit and circumference, one hundred and fourteene
miles.


(3) The ayre is very wholesome and pleasant, yet bleake enough, as exposed to the windes on
all sides, and the high hilles, wherewith it is in many places enuitoned, long retaining the congealed
snow. The tops whereof, in the Summer time, are the haruest-mens Almanacks, by the rising of
certaine vapours thereon in the mornings, and foreshew a faire day ensuing.


(4) The soyle is but barren towards the West part: yet the middle, where it lieth flat in a valley,
is most fertile. The East side, when it is once past the valley, findeth Nature to be a very sparing nig∣gard
of her sauours: but next vnto 
Dee
 it feeleth a more liberall extent of her blessings. The West
part is but here and there inhabited, and mounteth vp more then the other with bare and hungry
hilles: yet the leanesse of the soyle (where the hils settle any thing flatting) hath beene now a
good while begun to be ouercome by the diligent paines and carefull industry of the husbandmen;


for they paring away the vpper coat of the earth into certaine Turffes, with a broad kinde of spade,
pile them vp artificially on heapes, and fire them, so as being turned into ashes, and throwne vpon
the ground so pared, they fructifie the hungry barrennesse and sterilitie of soyle, and make the fields
bring forth a kinde of 
Rie
 or 
Anull-corne,
 in such plentie, as is hardly to be beleeued.


(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Countrey were the 
Ordouices,
 who being also named 
Or∣de
ices,

or 
Ordo
icae:
 a puissant and couragious people, by reason they kept wholly in a mountainous
place, and tooke heart euen of the soyle it selfe: for they continued longest free from the yoke both
of 
Roman,
 and also of 
English
 dominion. They were not subdued by the 
Romans,
 before the dayes
of the Emperor 
Domitian
 (for then 
Iulius Agricola
 conquered almost the whole Nation) nor brought
vnder the command of the 
English,
 before the raigne of King 
Edward
 the first; but liued a long time
in a lawlesse kinde of libertie, as bearing themselues bold vpon their owne magnanimitie, and the
strength of the Country.


(6) The Mountaines of this County yeeld sufficiency of Neat, Sheepe, and Goats. The Val∣lies
in most places are very plenteous of Corne, especially Eastward on this side, betwixt the Riuers
of 
Alen
 and 
Dee;
 but the more Westerly part is heathy, and altogether barren. The heart of the
Shire shewes it selfe beneath the hilles, in a beautifull and pleasant Vale, reaching seauenteene miles
in length from South to North, and fiue miles, or thereabouts, in bredth, and lieth open onely to∣ward
the Sea. It is enuironed on euery side with high hilles, amongst which, the highest is 
Mo
llenlly,

on the top whereof is a warlike Fense with Trench and Rampier, and a little fountaine of cleare wa∣ter.
From these hilles, the Riuer 
Cluyd
 resorts vnto this Vale, and from the very spring-head (in∣creased
with beckes and brookes) doth part it in twaine, running thorow the midst of it; whereof
in ancient time it was named 
Strat Cluyd:
 for 
Mariam
s
 maketh mention of a King of the 
Strat Cluyd

of the 
Welsh:
 And at this day it is commonly called 
Diffryn Cluyd,
 that is, 
The Vale of Cluyd.



This thing is worthy obseruation, as a matter memorable, both for admiration and antiquitie,
that in the Parish of 
Llan-sanan
 within this Country, there is a place compasse cut out of the maine
rocke by mans hand, in the side of a stony hill, wherein there be foure and twentie seats to sit in,
some lesse, some bigger, where children and young men, comming to seeke their Cattell, vse to sit,
and to haue their sports. And at this day they commonly call it 
Arthurs round Table.


(7) 
Henry Lacy
 Earle of 
Lincolne,
 obtaining 
Denbigh
 by the grant of King 
Edward
 the first, after
the conuiction and beheading of 
Dauid
 brother of 
Llewellin
 for high Treason, was the first that for∣tified
it with a wall about, not large in circuit, but very strong, and on the South-side with a faire
Castle, strengthned with many high Towers. But he gaue it ouer, and left the worke vnfinished,
conceiuing griefe (as a sorrowfull father) that his onely sonne came to vntimely death, and was
drowned in the Well thereof: The fame of this Towne spreads it selfe farre for repute, as being
reckoned the most beautifull place in all 
North-Wales:
 and it is of no lesse report, for the Castle ad∣iunct
vnto it is impregnable for fortification. And this strange accident happning there in the yeare
1575▪ deserues not to be omitted, being left as a continuall remembrance of Gods mercifull proui∣dence
and preseruation at that time: that whereby reason of great Earth-quakes, many people were
put into great feare, and had much harme done vnto them both within and without their ho
ses, in
the Cities of 
Yorke, Worcester, Glocester, Bristow, Hertford,
 and in other Countries adiacent, yet in the
Shire-hall of 
Denbigh
 the bell was caused to toll twice, by the shaking of the earth, and no hurt or
hindrance at all either done or receiued. The gouernment of this Towne is managed by two Alder∣men,
and two Bailiffes, who are yearely elected out of twentie fiue burgestes, that are their assistants.
It hath one Recorder, one Towne-Clerke, and two Sergeants at Mace: and by obseruation of the

Mathematickes,
 the Pole is eleuated in the degree of Latitude 53. and 49. scruples, and from the
first point in Longitude 16. and 45.



(8) This County, with them of 
Flint
 and 
Car
ar
on-shires,
 are not diuided by prickes into their
seuerall Hundreds, according to the rest of this worke, the want of their particulars in the Parlament
Rowles so causing it, which for the good of these three Shires, I earnestly sought to haue supplied
from the 
Nomina Villarum,
 in their Sheriffes bookes, and had promise of them that might easily haue
procured the same. But whether a fearelesse jealousie possessed their spirits, left the riches of these
Shires, by reuealing such particulars, should be further sought into, I cannot say: yet this I haue
obserued in all my Suruey, that where least is to be had, the greatest feares are possessed. Take these
Shires therefore to be done as I could, and not as I would, that wish both the wealth of them all,
and their esteeme to be of better regard by those that may doe them good.


(9) This Shire then is diuided into twelue Hundreds, for the readier ordering of businesses ne∣cessary
to the State of the Country; wherein are placed three Market-Townes, fit for buying and
selling, and other negotiations. It hath fiue Castles to defend her selfe, and to offend her enemies,
and fiftie seauen Parishes for Gods diuine seruice and worship.








FLINT-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XII.


FLINT-SHIRE, stretching out in length, broad at one end, and narrow at another, is not
much vnlike in fashion to a wedge, a peece of which is cut off by the meeting of 
Cheshire
 and

Denbigh-shire,
 South-East in distance some foure miles. It borders East-ward with part of 
Che∣shire,

from whence it is guarded in length with the Riuer 
Dee
 vnto the North, which parteth

Worrall
 and 
Flint-shire,
 till you come to a little Iland called 
Hel
bree.
 Northward it is bounded
with the 
Virgiuian
 Sea: on the West, a little Riuer, called 
Cluyd,
 parteth her and 
Denbigh-shire
 asun∣der:
and on the South altogether by 
Shrop-shire▪


(2) This Country is nothing mountainous, as other parts of 
Wales
 are, but rising gently all along
the Riuer of 
Dee,
 makes a faire shew and prospect of her selfe to euery eye that beholds her, as well
vpon the Riuer, being in most places thereabouts foure or fiue miles broad, as vpon the other side
thereof, being a part of 
Cheshire.


(3) The Aire is healthfull and temperate, without any foggie clouds or fennie vapours, sauing
that sometimes there ariseth from the Sea, and the Riuer 
Dee,
 certaine thicke and smoky-seeming
mists, which neuerthelesse are not found hurtfull to the Inhabitants, who in this part liue long and
healthfully.


(4) The Clime is somewhat colder there then in 
Cheshire,
 by reason of the Sea, and the Riuer
that engirts the better part of her; by which, the Northerne windes being long carried vpon the
waters, blow the more cold; and that side of the Country vpward, that lieth shoaring vnto the top,
hauing neither shelter nor defence, receiueth them in their full power, and is naturally a Bulwarke


from their violence vnto her bordering neighbours, that maketh the snow to lie much longer there
then on the other side of the Riuer.


(5) The Soile bringeth forth plentie both of Corne and Grasse, as also great store of Cattle,
but they be little. To supply which defect, they haue more by much in their numbers then in o∣ther
places where they be bigger. Great store of Fish they take in the Riuer of 
Dee,
 but little from
the Sea, by reason they haue no Hauens or Creekes for boats. No great store of woods either there
or in any other part of 
Wales
 are found, it hauing beene a generall plague vnto all the Country euer
since the head-strong rebellions of their Princes and great men against the Kings of 
England,
 that
(in time) tooke away the principall helpes of their Innouations, by cutting downe their woods,
whereof in this Shire there hath heretofore beene great plentie. Fruits are scarce, but milke, butter,
and cheese plentie, as also store of hony, of the which they make a pleasant wine, in colour like (in
taste not much vnlike) vnto Muskadine, which they call 
Mathegli
.
 Yea, and in the dayes of 
Giral∣dus
Cambrensis,
 neere the place now called 
Holy-well,
 was a rich Mine of Siluer, in seeking after which,
men pierced and pried into the very bowels of the earth.


(6) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the 
Ordouices,
 a sturdie people against the

Romans,
 but now most kinde and gentle towards the 
English,
 and indeede make much of all stran∣gers,
except they be crossed, and then they are the contrary.


(7) Places of defence are the Castles of 
Flint, Hawarden,
 vulgarly 
Harden, Treer, Rudland, Mold,
Yowley,
 and 
Hope:
 of which, 
Flint
 and 
Harden
 are the two principall. The Castle of 
Flint,
 famous for
the benefit it receiued from two Kings, and for the refuge and reliefe it gaue vnto the third. It was
founded by 
Henry
 the second, finished by 
Edward
 the first, and long after gaue harbour and enter∣tainment
to that noble, but vnfortunate Prince, 
Richard
 the second, comming out of 
Ireland,
 being
within her walles a free and absolute King, but no sooner without, but taken prisoner by 
Henry Bul∣lingbrooke,



Duke of 
Lancaster,
 losing at that time his libertie, and not long after his life. This standeth
in the graduation of Latitude 53. 55. minutes, in Longitude 17.


For the Castle of 
Hawarden,
 no record remaines of the first founder, but that it was held a long
time by the Stewards of the Earles of 
Chester.
 Howbeit, their resistances did not so generally consist
in the strength of their Castles and Fortifications, as in their Mountaines and Hils, which in times
of danger serued as naturall Bulwarkes and Defences vnto them against the force of enemies. As
was that which standeth in a certaine strait set about with woods, neere vnto the Riuer, 
Alen,
 called

Coles-hull,
 that is, 
Coles-hill,
 where the 
English,
 by reason of their disordered multitude, not ranged
close in good array, lost the field, and were defeated, when King 
Henry
 the second had made as great
preparation as might be to giue battle vnto the 
Welsh,
 and the very Kings Standard was forsaken by

Henry
 of 
Essex,
 who was Standard-bearer to the Kings of 
England
 in right of inheritance.


(8) This Country hath many shallow riuers in it, but none of fame and note, but 
Dee
 and 
Cluyde.

Howbeit, there is a Spring not farre from 
Rudland Castle,
 of great report and antiquitie, which is
termed 
Fons Sacer,
 in English, 
Holy-Well,
 and is also commonly called S. 
Winefrids Well;
 of whom an∣tiquitie
thus reporteth: That 
Winefrid
 a Christian Virgin, very faire and vertuous, was doated vpon
by a young lustfull Prince or Lord of the Country, who not long able to rule his head-strong af∣fections,
hauing many times in vaine attempted and tryed her chastitie both by rich gifts and large
promises, could not by any meanes obtaine his desires; he therefore (in a place of aduantage) sud∣denly
surprized and rauished her weake (yet resisting) body. After the deed done, the cruell Ty∣rant,
to stop her cries and acclamations, slew her, and cut off her head: out of which place did sud∣denly
arise a Spring that continueth to this day, carrying from the Fountaine such a forcible streame
and current, as the like is not found in Christendome. Ouer the head of the Spring there is built a
Chappell of free stone, with Pillars curiously wrought and engraued, in the Chancell whereof, and


glasse window, the picture of the Virgin is drawne, together with the memoriall of her life and death.
To this Fountaine Pilgrims are accustomed to repaire in their zealous, but blind deuotion; and
diuers others resort to bathe in, holding firmely that the water is of much vertue.


There be many red stones in the bottome of this Well, and much greene mosse growing vpon
the sides: the superstition of the people holding that those red spots in the stones were drops of the
Ladies bloud, which all the water in the Spring can neuer wash away; and that the mosse about the
wall was her haire, which though some of it be giuen to euery stranger that comes, yet it neuer wa∣steth.
But howsoeuer this be carried for truth by the tradition of time, the mosse it selfe smels ex∣ceeding
sweet.


There is also hard by 
Kilken
 (a small village) within this Countie, a little Well of no great note,
that at certaine times riseth and falleth, after the manner of Sea-tydes.


(9) In the South part of this Country, diuided from the rest, is a place (in some written Cop∣pies
of 
Antonine,
 called 
Bouium)
 which we now terme 
Banchor,
 first a Citie, and afterwards a Mona∣stery
of famous memory, and the first that is read of in the world: wherein (as 
Beda
 saith) were a great
number of Monkes, and them diuided into seauen Companies, euery one hauing his seuerall Ruler
assigned. None of these Companies had lesse then three hundred persons deuoted to prayer, and
to get liuing by their owne labour, for themselues and the poore: although it hath long since beene
vtterly ruinate, so as now there is scarce seene the face and outward shew of a dead Citie or Mona∣stery.
It hath onely the names of two Gates remaining, one standing a mile distant from another,
and betwixt which the Riuer 
Dee
 now runneth, where are often times found many pieces of 
Romane

Coyne, and other tokens of antiquitie. But of these shall be more mention made in the following
History.


Another like Monastry, but of lesser account, stood in the Vale beneath 
Varis
 (a little Citie pla∣ced


the 
Romans
 in the confines of this Shire and 
Deabigh-shire)
 and vpon the Ranke of 
Elwy
 and

Cluyd:
 This the 
Britaines
 call 
, of the Riuer, the 
Englishmen, Asuph,
 of the Founder; and
the 
Historiographers, Asphensis.
 It is more famouse for antiquitie, then for building o
 brauery: for
about the yeare 560 
Kentigein
 Bishop of 
Glas
,
 being fled 
 out of 
Scotland,
 placed here a Bi∣shops
See, and erected a Monastry, gathering together 66
. in a religious brotherhood, whereof
300. that were vnlearned, gaue themselues to husbandrie, and to worke within the Monastery; the
rest to prayer and meditations. When he returned into 
Scotland,
 he ordained 
Asaph,
 a godly and
vpright man, to be gouernous ouer this Monastery, of whom it tooke the name, and is called 
Saint
Asaphs.


Another Monastry of great account was at 
Basingwarke
 in this County, neere vnto which began
that admirable Ditch drawne thence vnto the mouth of 
 by King 
Offa,
 the Tract whereof I
haue expressed thorow this Shire, and will further speake thereof in the following History.


(10) This Shire is diuided into fiue Hundreds, fortified with seauen Castles, hath onely one
Market-Towne, and twentie eight Parishes, in which there is a continuall celebration of diuine Ser∣uice.













ANGLESEY.
CHAPTER XIII.


ANGLESEY was in the time of the 
Romans
 called 
Mona,
 by the 
Britaines Mon,
 and 
Tir-Mon,

(that is) the Land of 
Mon,
 of the ancient 
English-Saxons Moneg:
 And at last, after the 
Eng∣lishmen

had by their sharpe and seuerall assaults brought it vnder their rules, and became
Lords thereof, it was termed 
Anglesey,
 as one would say, 
The Englishmens Iland.


(2) For, an 
Iland
 it is, albeit it be seuered from the Continent of 
Britaine,
 but with a small
and narrow streight of the riuer 
Menai,
 and on all other parts beaten vpon with the surging and trou∣blous

Irish Sea,
 in which it lyeth somewhat square-wise, not much different in length and breadth;
being, where it reacheth out in length, from 
Beau-marish
 Eastward, to the vtmost Promontory
West-ward, which we call 
Holy-head,
 twentie miles; and in breadth from 
Llanbaderik
 North-ward,
to the point of 
Menai
 South-ward, seauenteene miles; the whole circuit or circumference amounting
towards seauentie miles.


(3) The aire is reasonable gratefull and healthfull, and not generally subiect to diseases, excep∣ting
certaine Agues at some times, which are occasioned by the sogs and misty exhalations, which
arise from the Sea called 
Mare Virginium,
 with the which this Ile is encompassed.


(4) The Commodities that commend (or rather beautifie) this Country, are in Corne and
Cattle, wherewith it not onely enricheth it selfe exceedingly, but sendeth out great prouision there∣of
to others to supply their defects, and although the ground may seeme dry and stony, or vnplea∣sant
and nothing sightly, wherein for the outward qualitie it resembleth some other parts of 
Wales,

that are not so fruitfull, yet for the inward bounties of nature, it is farre vnlike: for aboue all the


Coasts of 
Wales
 it is most plentifull of Wheat, insomuch as by 
Giraldus Cambrensis
 report, they are
wont to say in 
Welsh,
 by way of a Prouerbe, 
Mon Mam Combry,
 which is to say, 
Mon
 is the mother
of 
Wales;
 for that when other Countries haruest failes round about, or their prouision is exhaust and
drawne dry, this alone, like a prouident and full-brested mother, is able to sustaine the rest Where∣unto
Nature most prouidently hath added another benefit seruiceable and necessary to the former,
in that the Country produceth also those kinde of stones which are called 
Mol
res,
 is of all other
fittest to make 
Mill-stones
 or 
Grind-stones.
 In some places also it yeeldeth an earth of 
Alumino
 qua∣litie,
out of which some not long since began to make 
Alom
 and 
Coperose,
 who (like vnflesht Souldi∣ers)
gaue ouer their enterprise without further hope, because at first they saw it not answere their
ouer-hastie expectations.


(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the 
Ord
ices,
 mentioned before in the pre∣cedent
Prouinces of 
Denbigh-shire, Flint-shire,
 and 
Carnaruon-shire.
 And this very Iland was that
ancient, and so much enobled seate of the 
British Druyds,
 who so amated the Army of 
Romane
 in∣uaders,
as 
Tacitus
 reports, and as else-where we haue related in the sixt Booke and seauenth Chapter
of our ensuing History.


(6) This Nation was attempted first by 
Pa
linus Suetonius
 in the raigne of 
Nero,
 but brought
vnder the 
Romane
 Empire by 
Iulius Agricola.
 When the Empire of the 
Romanes
 in 
Britaine
 began to
decline and goe downeward, some out of 
Ireland
 entred into this Isle by stealth, and nestled them∣selues
there, as may be gathered by certaine mounts of earth entrenched about, and yet to be seene,
which they call the 
I
sh mens Cottages:
 as also by a place named of the 
Irish-men, yn Hieriey Gwidid,

who did there (as is recorded) put the 
Britaines
 to flight, vnder the leading of 
Sinigus.
 The 
Norwe∣gians

also were often infestuous to this Iland; but King 
Ethelreds
 Fleet, hauing in the yeare 1000.
scowred the Seas round about this Isle, far exceeded all both 
Irish
 and 
Norwegian
 depopulations, for
they wasted the Country in all hostile manner.












(7) After this, two 
Hughs,
 both 
Normans,
 did greatly afflict this Iland: The one being Earle of

Chester,
 the other of 
Shrewsbury;
 at which very time 
Magnus
 the 
Norwegian
 arriuing there, shot 
Hugh

Earle of 
Shrewsbury
 through with an Arrow, and departed after he had ransacked the Iland. It was
afterwards grieuously infested by the 
Englishmen,
 who neuer gaue ouer from time to time to inuade
it, vntill in the raigne of King 
Edward
 the first, it was wholly brought vnder his subiection.


(8) The principall Towne in this Isle is 
Beaumarish,
 which the said King 
Edward
 the first built
in the East side thereof, and for the faire situation, though in a Morish place, gaue it the name which
it now beareth, whereas in times past it was called 
Bonouer;
 which he also fortified with a goodly
Castle.


(9) The Maior is the chiefest Magistrate of the Towno, who is yearely chosen, and hath the
assistance and helpe of two Bailiffes, two Sergeants at Mace, and one Towne-Clerke: by whose
carefull diligence the affaires of this Towne are orderly managed and commanded: whose Latitude
is 54. and Longitude 15. 45. minutes.


(10) Not far from hence is 
Lhaanuais,
 in times past a faire religious house of the 
Friars Minors,

which although it be now in a manner raced out of memory, yet antiquitie maketh mention that it
hath beene of great regard among the Kings of 
England,
 who haue shewed themselues very bounti∣full
Patrons vnto that Couent, both in respect of the sanctimonious life of such as conuersed there,
as also because there the bodies of very eminent persons, as the daughter of King 
Iohn,
 the sonne of
a King of the 
Danes,
 as likewise of many great Lords, Knights, and Squires, were enterred, that were
slaine in the warres against the 
Welsh,
 in the time of many illustrious Kings of 
England.


(11) This Isle is reckoned to haue had anciently many Villages in it, euen to the number of
three hundred threescore and three; and the same euen at this day is very well peopled.



The diuision of this Ile for disposition of affaires that belong either to the state of the Cro
,
or to the condition of the Country, is into six Hundreds: in which are seated two Market-Townes,
and seuentie foure Parish-Churches for Gods diuine honour and worship.








CAERNARVON-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XIIII.


CAERNARVON-SHIRE, in 
Welsh, Sire Caer-ar-von,
 so called because it is iust ouer a∣gainst

Anglesey,
 (which the 
Britaines
 call 
Mon,)
 and in composition was termed also 
Snow∣den-Forrest,

before 
Wales
 was laid into Shires; the North-side whereof and the West butteth
vpon the 
Irish Sea,
 the South-side is inclosed with 
Merioneth,
 and the East with 
Denbigh-shires,

from which it is seuered by the Riuer 
Conwey.


(2) The forme thereof is much like a wedge, long and narrow toward the South, and growing
still wider towards the North: so that from 
Penenkel-point
 South-ward, to 
Orms-head-point
 North∣ward,
are fortie miles, from the Riuer 
Conwey
 Eastward, to the Riuer 
Llenoy
 Westward, miles twen∣tie:
and the whole circumference one hundred and ten miles.


(3) The Aire is sharpe and piercing, by reason that the Country hath not naturall prouision to
ensconce her selfe against the extremitie of winds and weather: but especially as may be thought,
through the continuance of the Snow on the hils, which also exclude the Suns aspect and warmth.


(4) The soile cannot be much commended for the fertilitie, except those parts of the Sea-coasts,
which lye on the West towards 
Ireland:
 but for the heart of this Shire, it is altogether mountainous,
as if Nature had a purpose here, by rearing vp these craggy hils so thicke together, strongly to com∣pact
the ioynts of this our Iland, and to frame the Inland part thereof for a fit place of refuge to the

Britaines,
 against those times of aduersitie which afterward did fall vpon them; for no Army though
neuer so strongly, or scarce any Trauellers, though neuer so lightly appointed, can finde passage a∣mong
those so many rough and hard Rockes, so many Vales and Pooles here and there, crossing


all the wayes, as ready obstacles to repell any Inroades of forraine a
ailants. These Mountaines may
not vnfitly be termed the 
British Alpes,
 as being the most vaste of all 
Britaine,
 and for their steepnesse
and cragginesse not vnlike to those of 
Italy,
 all of them towring vp into the Aire, and round encom∣passing
one farre higher then all the rest, peculiarly called 
Snowdon-Hill,
 though the other likewise in
the same sense, are by the 
Welsh
 termed 
Cralg Er
ry,
 as much as 
Snowy Mountaines,
 taking their name
as doth (by 
Plinies
 testimony) 
Niphates
 in 
Armenia,
 and 
Imaus
 in 
Schithia:
 For all the yeare long
these lye mantelled ouer with Snow hard crusted together, though otherwise for their height they
are open and liable both to the Sunne to dissolue them, and the windes to ouer-sweepe them.


(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the 
Ordouices,
 of whom we haue sufficiently
spoken in the description of the former Prouinces; neither need I insist either vpon the pleasures or
profits that this Country yeeldeth, by reason of the great affinity it hath both of Climate and Com∣modities
with 
Denbigh-shire
 and 
Flint-shire
 before mentioned But this beyond the other in some pla∣ces
breeds certaine 
Shel-fishes,
 which being conceiued by an heauenly dew bring forth Pearles, in
ancient times 
 of then now they are.


(6) Touching places of note, that Citie is very ancient which the Emperour 
Antonine
 calleth

Segontium,
 taking name of a Riuer running by, which at this day is called 
Seront:
 some reliques of
the walls whereof doe yet appeare, neere vnto a little Church consecrated to the honour of 
Saint
Publicius.
 This Citie 
Ninius
 calleth 
Caer Custenith,
 which some interpret the Citie of 
Constantine.

Indeed 
Mathew Westminster
 saith (how true I know not) that 
Anno
 1283. here was found the body
of 
Constantius
 (Father to great 
Constantine)
 which King 
Edward
 the first caused to be sumptuously
bestowed in the Church of the new Citie, which he raised out of the ruines of the old, and is now
called 
Ca
naruon,
 which giueth name to this whole Shire. The Towne it selfe yeeldeth a most


excellent prospect towards the Sea, and is incompassed (in a manner) round with the wals of the
Castle: so as we may say, it is a Citie within a Castle, which taketh vp the whole West-side of it:
and great pitie it is, that so famous a worke should not be perpetuous, or euer become the ruine of
time, which is much feared, for the mercilesse vnderminings of the Sea, that with her daily and for∣cible
irruptions neuer ceaseth to wash away the foundations of the Key. The people of this Towne
are well approued for courte
ie, and also Ciuill gouernment, which is administred by the Constable
of the Castle (who is euer Maior by Patent) hauing the assistance of one 
Alderman,
 two 
Bailiffes,

two 
Sergeants
 at 
Mace,
 and one 
Towne-Clerke.
 The Townesmen doe not a little glory that King

Edward
 the second was borne there, in a Tower of the Castle called 
Eagle-Tower,
 and surnamed
of 
Caer-nar-uon,
 he being the first Prince of 
Wales
 of the 
English
 line. The site of this Towne accor∣ding
to Mathematicall obseruation is in the degree of Longitude 15. and 50. scruples from the first
West-point, and the Pole eleuated in Latitude 53. and 50.


Bangor
 the Bishops See, though it be now but a small Towne, yet it was in time past so large,
that for the greatnesse thereof it was called 
Banchor Vaur,
 that is, 
Great Banchor;
 which 
Hugh
 Earle
of 
Chester
 fortified with a Castle: But it hath beene long since vtterly ruinated and laid leuell with
the ground, in so much as there is not any footing to be found, or other monuments left thereof, al∣though
they haue beene sought with all diligent enquiry. This Bishops See hath within the Dioces
ninetie six Parishes. But the ancient Church which was consecrated vnto 
Daniel,
 sometime Bishop
thereof, was defaced and set on fire by that notorious Rebell 
Owen Glendowerdwy,
 who had a pur∣pose
also to destroy all the Cities of 
Wales,
 for that they stood for the King of 
England.
 And though
the same Church was since repaired about the time of King 
Henry
 the seauenth, yet hath it scarce
recouered the resemblance of her former dignitie.



The Riuer 
Conwey
 (which limitteth this Shire on the East-side) is in 
Ptolemy
 by corruption or
ignorance of Transcribers called 
Toisonius,
 in stead of 
Cononius,
 whence 
Canonium
 (a Towne men∣tioned
by 
Antonine)
 tooke name: and albeit both it and its name be now vtterly extinct, yet is there
a couert remembrance thereof in the new name of a poore Village, standing among the rubbish
thereof, called 
Caer-hean,
 (that is) The ancient Citie: Out of the spoyle whereof King 
Edward

the first, built a new Towne at the Riuers mouth, termed thereupon 
Aber-Conwey:
 (that is) the
mouth of 
Conwey,
 which being formerly fortified by 
Hugh
 of 
Chester,
 and strongly situate and fenced
both with wals & a faire Castle by the Riuers side, deserues rather the name of a Citie then a Towne,
if it were more populous and traffiqued with Inhabitants Neither must I here forget 
Newin,
 though
but a small Market-Towne, for that it pleased the English Nobles 
Anno
 1284 to honour it and the
memory of King 
Arthur,
 with triumphant celebritie, after they had subdued the rebellious Ring∣leaders
of 
Wales.


(7) Other matters of memorable note this Country affordeth not much, vnlesse perhaps this;
That iust ouer against the Riuer 
Conwey,
 where it iflueth into the Sea, there sometimes stood an anci∣ent
Citie named 
Diganwey,
 which many yeares agoe was consumed by lightning, and so made vtter∣ly
desolate, as many other monuments haue beene, of ancient and worthy memory. As likewise
that in the Poole 
Lin-Peris,
 there is a kinde of Fish called there 
Torco
h,
 hauing a red belly, no where
else seene. For touching these two other miracles famoused by 
Giraldus
 and 
Geruasius,
 that on those
his high hils there are two Pooles called the 
Meares,
 the one of which produceth great store of fish,
but all hauing onely one eye, and in the other there is a moueable Iland, which as soone as a man
treadeth on, it forthwith floateth a great way off, whereby the 
Welsh
 are said to haue often scaped
and deluded their enemies assailing them: these matters are out of my Creed, and yet I thinke the
Reader had rather beleeue them, then to goe to see whether it be so or no.



It is traded with fiue Market-Townes fit for bargaining, buying and selling, fortified with foure
Castles, and hath sixtie eight Parish-Churches in it, where the Inhabitants concurre and meete to∣gether
for the celebration of Diuine Seruice.













SCOTLANDS GENERALL DESCRIPTION.
CHAPTER I.


SCOTLAND, the second Kingdome of 
Great Britaine,
 and the North part of the Iland,
hath on the East the 
Germane Ocean,
 on the North, the 
Orkneys,
 and 
Deucalidon Sea,
 the West
affronted with 
Ireland,
 and the South hath the Riuer 
Tweed,
 the 
Cheuiot Hils,
 and the adiacent
Tract, reaching to the 
Sulway
 Sands, whereby it is separated from 
England.


(2) This Kingdome is faire and spacious, and from these South-borders spreadeth it selfe
wide into the East and West, till againe it contracts it selfe narrower vnto the Northerne Promon∣tories:
furnished with all things befitting a famous Kingdome; both for Ayre and Soyle, Riuers,
Woods, Mountaines, Fish, Fowle, and Cattle, and Corne so plenteous, that it supplyeth therewith
other Countryes in their want. The people thereof are of good feature, strong of body, and of cou∣ragious
minde, and in warres so venturous, that scarce any seruice of note hath beene performed,
but that they were with the first and last in the field. Their Nobilitie and Gentry are very studious
of learning, and all ciuill knowledge; for which end they not onely frequent the three Vniuersities
of their owne Kingdome (S. 
Andrewes, Glasco,
 and 
Edenbrough,
 the Nurseries of Pietie, and Man∣sions
of the sacred 
Muses)
 but also much addict themselues to trauell into forraine Countries.


(3) The Counties contained in this Kingdome are many, and euery where bestrewed with Ci∣ties,
Towne, and Borrowes, as is that of 
England:
 and, as 
England,
 I entended to describe it, had I
not beene happily preuented by a learned Gentleman of that Nation, who hath most exactly be∣gun,








and gone through the greatest difficulties thereof; to build vpon whose foundations, I hold it
iniurious: and am so farre from any ambition to preuent his noble purposes, that I heartily with all
happie furtherances thereto, with a longing desire to see, by his industrious labours, another 
Scene

added to the perfecting of the 
Theatre of Britaines glory.


(4) Yet, in the meane while, lest I should seeme too difectiue in my intendments, let me with∣out
offence (in this third, though short Booke) giue onely a generall view of that Kingdome, vpon
obseruations from others; which to accomplish by mine owne suruey (if others should hap to faile,
and my crazy-aged-body will giue leaue) is my chiefe desire; knowing the Iland furnished with
many worthy remembrances, appertaining both vnto them and vs, whom God now hath set vnder
one Crowne: and the rather, for that their more Southerne people are from the same Originall
with vs the 
English,
 being both alike the 
Saxon
 branches: as also, that the 
Picts
 anciently inhabiting
part of that Kingdome, were the inborne 
Britaines,
 and such as thither fled to auoid the 
Romane
 serui∣tude:
whose names began first to be distinguished vnder 
Dioclesian
 the Emperour, when they were
termed 
Picts
 for painting their bodies, like the 
Britaines,
 as such 
Flauius Vigetius:
 which is more
strengthened, for that the Northerne 
Britaines
 conuerted by Saint 
Columb,
 are called 
Britaine
Picts.


(5) But the 
Highland-men
 (the naturall 
Scot
 indeed) are supposed to descend from the 
Scythi∣ans,

who with the 
Getes
 infesting 
Ireland,
 left both their Issue there, and their manners, apparant in
the 
Wild-Irish
 euen to this day: And from 
Scithae
 (as is thought) the name of 
Scot
 grew; for so the

Netherlanders
 by 
Scutten
 expresse indifferently the 
Scythian
 or 
Scot:
 so 
Gildas
 calleth the 
Irish-Bri∣taines,
Scythians:
 so King 
Elfeed
 in translating the Historie of 
Orosius,
 turneth 
Scotos
 into 
Scyttan:

and so saith 
Walsingham,
 from one and the same originall, 
Scythae, Scytici, Scotae, Scotici,
 take their
names, as from 
Getae, Getici, Gothi, Gothici
 haue done.








(6) Their manner were alike, saith 
Diodorus, Siculus,
 and 
Strabo,
 and their garments not much
different, as by 
Sidonius Apollinaris
 may be gathered, where he seemeth rather to describe the mo∣derne

Wild-Irish,
 then the antike 
Gete.
 Notwithstanding this Nations Originall by some hath beene
deriued from 
Scota,
 the supposed Daughter of the 
Egyptian
 King 
Pharoah,
 that nourished 
Moses,
 af∣terwards
married vnto 
Gaithelus,
 the son of 
Cecrops,
 (Founder of 
Athens)
 who first seating in 
Spaine,

passed thence into 
Ireland,
 and lastly into 
Scotland,
 where his Wife 
Scota
 gaue 
Name
 to the 
Nation;

if we beleeue that they hit the marke, who shoot at the 
Moone.


(7) But that the 
Scythians
 came into 
Spaine,
 (besides the Promontory bearing their Name 
Scy∣thi
um)
Silius Italicus,
 a 
Spanyard
 borne, doth shew, who bringeth the 
Concani,
 a Nation therein sea∣ted,
from the 
Massagetae,
 which were the 
Scythians;
 and the 
Sarmatae,
 whom all confesse to haue bin

Scythians,
 were the builders (as he saith) of the Citie 
Susanna
 in 
Spaine▪
 And how from 
Spaine
 they
possessed themselues of 
Ireland,
 (at the time when the Kingdome of 
Iulah
 flourished,) 
Ninius
 the
Disciple of 
Eluodugus
 doth tell, and their owne Histories of 
Nemethus
 and 
Delas,
 besides 
Cisnerus
 and
others, doe shew; who were first knowne by the name of 
Scots,
 as is gathered out of 
Prophyry
 (alled∣ged
by S. 
Ierome)
 in the raigne of 
Aurelianus
 the Emperour. 
Gildas
 calleth them the 
Irish-Spoilers:
Giraldus, A Scotish Nation, descended from Ireland:
 which in regard of them by 
Eginbardus
 is termed

The Ile of Scots:
 by 
Beda, The Ile inhabited by the Scots;
 and by other Historians, 
Scotland the great;

as their seate in 
Britaine
 was called 
Scotland the lesse.


(8) These, when the 
Romane Empire
 was farre in the wane, burst into 
Britaine
 vnder 
Reuda
 their
Captaine, who entring amitie with the 
Picts,
 possessed the North part of the Iland, and assisted them
against the 
Britaines,
 then ready to fall, when the 
Romanes
 were gone. But these afterward entertaining
dissentions amongst themselues, put the hazard of their estates on the tryall and chance of one dayes
battle, fought betwixt them in the yeare of Saluation, 740. Wherein the 
Picts
 not onely lost their








liues, but soone after euen their very name also, and 
Fortune
 crowning the 
Scots
 with victory, aduan∣ced
their Kingdome vnto such fame and strength, that the same hath long continued without any
absolute conquest or surprise, against the assaults of whatsoeuer enemies.


(9) 
Scotlands
 South part in 
Galloway,
 washed with the warer of 
Solway Bay,
 toucheth degree 56.
of 
Latitude,
 and thence inbosoming many Loughes and In-lets vpon the 
East
 and 
West,
 extendeth it
selfe vnto the degree 60 and 30 minutes; whose 
Longitude
 is likewise laid betwixt the degree 13 and
19 and the same growne very narrow, being so neere the 
North-Pole,
 as lying directly vnder the hin∣dermost
Starres of the 
Greater Beare.


(10) The whole Kingdome is diuided into two parts by the great Riuer 
Tay;
 the 
South
 whereof
is the more populous, and more beautified in manners, riches, and ciuilitie: the North more rude,
retaining the customes of the 
Wild-Irish,
 the ancient 
Scot,
 in whose seuerall Territories these Coun∣ties
ensuing are contained.

Amongst the things worthy of note of Antiquitie in this Kingdome, most memorable was that
Fortification drawne from 
Abercorne
 vpon the 
Frith
 of 
Edenborough,
 vnto 
Aleluya,
 how 
Dunbritton,

opening vpon the West Sea, where 
Iulius Agricola
 set the limit of the 
Romane
 Empire; past which,
saith 
Tacitus,
 there was no other bounds of 
Britaine
 to be sought for: and that here the second Le∣gion

Augusta,
 and the 20. Legion 
Victrix,
 built a part of the Wall, certaine Inscriptions there dig∣ged
vp, and reserued at 
Dunloyr
 and 
Cader,
 doe witnesse: as also an ancient coped monument of an
high and round compasse, which, as some thinke, was a Temple consecrated vnto the God 
Ter
:

others, a 
Trophey
 raised by 
Carausius,
 who fortified this Wall with seauen Castles, as 
Ninius
 doth
declare.


(12) At this place began the great and darke Wood 
Caled
nia,
 famous for the wilde white Buls








that therein were bred whose Manes were Lion like, thicke and cuuled, of nature fierce and cruell,
and so hatefull to mankinde, that they abhorred whatsoeuer was by them handled or breathed vpon:
these Woods stretched farre and wide with many turnings, darke shades, and dreadfull dens, and so
famous in the 
Romane
 Writers, that they often vsed that name for all 
Britaine;
 whose Inhabitants
were the last in this Iland, that yeelded their neckes to the yoake of subiection, is shall appeare in our
following Story.


(13) 
Ninian
 a 
Britaine
 is recorded to haue conuerted the 
South-Ficts
 vnto the Faith of Christ
in the raigne of 
Theodosius
 the younger, and the Church in 
Galloway
 bearing his name doth witnes
it: so likewise in the same age 
Palladius
 sent from Pope 
Coelestine,
 became an Apostle vnto the 
Scots,

whose reliques lay enshrined at 
Fordo
 in 
Mernis,
 as was verily supposed: but that Christianitie had
beene formerly planted in this vttermost Prouince, is testified by 
Tertuilian,
 in saying the 
Britaines

had embraced the faith farther then the 
Romans
 had power to follow or persecute them, whereupon

Peter
 Monke of 
 
Spaine,
 concludeth their conuersion to be more ancient then the Southerne

Britaines.


(14) But touching things obseruable for the present, surely admirable is the report of the plenty
of Cattle, Fish, and Fowle there abiding: their Neat but little, yet many in number: Fish so plenti∣full
that men in some places (for delight) on horse-backe hunt 
Salmons
 with Speares: and a certaine
Fowle, which some call 
Soland-Geese,
 spreading so thicke in the ayre, that they euen darken the Suns
light; of whose flesh, feathers and oyle, the Inhabitants in some parts make great vse and gaine; yea,
and euen of fishes brought by them, abundant prouision for diet, as also of the stickes (brought to
make their nests) plentifull prouision for fuell.


(15) With these, as of wonders I might speake of the natures of those two famous Loughes,

Lomund
 and 
Nessa,
 the latter whereof neuer freezeth in Winter, though neuer so extreame, and the








waters of the other most raging in the fairest and calmest weather, wherein also floateth an Iland
that remoueth from place to place, as the winde forceth her spongeous and vnfastned body. In 
Bu∣quhan

vpon the banket of 
Ratra
 is a Well, whose trickling drops turne (in Piramidy-wise) into hard
stone, and another neere 
Edenbrough
 that floateth with 
Bitumen.
 In 
Dee
 and 
Done,
 besides the admi∣red
plenty of 
Salmons,
 is found a Shell-fish, called the 
Horse-mu
ll,
 wherein Pearles are engaendred,
most precious for Physicke, and some of them so Orient, that they giue not place to the choisest.


(16) No lesse strange then any the fore-mentioned waters, but more lamentable is the remem∣brance
of the great in
ndation, happing by the sodaine rising of 
Tay.
 which bare away the Walles
and Towne of 
Berth,
 and with it the Cradle and yong sonne of King 
William
 into the Sea, wherein the
Royall Insant with many others perished, the King and his Courtiers hardly escaping the danger
with life. The ruine of this Towne raised another more famous, and more commodiously seated,
euen 
Perth,
 since called Saint 
Iohns-Towne.


(17) Ilands and Ilets yeelding both beautie and subiection to this 
Scotish
 Kingdome, are the

Westerne,
 the 
Orknayes,
 and the 
Shetlands,
 reckoned to be aboue three hundred in number; the Inha∣bitants
for the most part vsing the frugalitie of the ancient 
Scot.


(18) The 
Westerne
 lying scattered in the 
Deucalidoman
 Sea, were anciently ruled by a King of
their owne, whose maintenance was out of their common Coffers, and the Regall Authoritie ne∣uer
continued in line all succession, for (to preuent that) their Kings were not permitted to haue
wiues of their owne, but might by their Lawes accompany with other mens: as the like Law was in
the other parts of 
Scotland,
 that the Virginitie of all new wiues, should be the Landlords prey, till
King 
Malcolme
 enacted, that halfe a marke should be paid for redemption. The residence of those
fore-mentioned Kings, was chiefly in 
Ila, Bunals,
 and 
Iona,
 now 
Columbkill,
 where (as 
Donald Munr
,

who trauelled through these Ilands reporteth) are three Tombes, hauing the seuerall Inscriptions
of the Kings of 
Scotland,
 of 
Ireland,
 and of 
Norway.



(19) Among these 
Westerne
 Ilands, the 
Hebrides, Skie, Mula, Ila,
 and 
Arran,
 are the greatest:
All of them plentifull of Corne, Woods, Salmons and F
errings, as others of Conies Deere, Hor∣ses,
and Sheepe, where in some they are wilde, and in others without any owners; but the people vn∣ciuill,
and lacking Religion, they rather liue rudely in state of necessitie, then as Lords of these por∣tions
which God hath allotted them; and with a sufferable ease, ignorant of ambition, enioy those
contentments, which some others (though they no great summe) doe more laboriously attaine vn∣to
by the precepts of Philosopie: for, feeding themselues with competencie without any excesse,
they returne all the ouer-plus vnto their Lords, as doe the Inhabitants of 
Hirta
 and 
Rona;
 but alas,
Religion not knowne among them, these penurious vertues are rather the curses of 
Cham,
 then the
followings of Christ, who forbids vs 
to be too carefull for the morrow.


(20) The Iles of 
Orkenay
 vpon the North of 
Scotland,
 lying in a most raging and tempestuous
Sea, are about three and thirtie in number, whereof thirteene are inhabited, and the other repleni∣shed
with Cattle: in these are no venomous Serpents, nor other vgly vermin; the aire sharpe and
healthfull, and the soile apt to beare onely Oats and Barley, but not a sticke of wood: among these,

Pomonia
 is the greatest, accounted and called the Maine-land, affording sixe Minerals of Lead and
Tinne, and in her chiefe Towne a Bishops See: wherein are seated twelue Parish-Churches, one of
them very magnificent for so remote a Country.


(21) Of all the 
Romanes, Iulius Agricola
 first discouered the 
Orkenays;
 yea, and subdued them,
if we will beleeue 
Tacitus:
 but 
Pomponius Mela,
 that wrote thirtie yeares before him, doth mention
them, and 
Iuuenal
 in 
Hadrians
 time after him, tels vs the 
Romanes
 had won them; and lastly, 
Claudian

nameth 
Saxons
 that were slaine in them and so doth 
Ninius
 name 
Octha
 and 
Ebissus, Saxon
 Com∣manders,
who in their rouing Pinnaces wasted the 
Orknays.
 These Ilands 
Donald Bane
 the vsurper of
the 
Scotish
 Crowne, gaue to the King of 
Norway
 for his assistance, and by the 
Norwegians
 were they


held the space of an hundred and sixtie yeares, vntill that 
Alexander
 the third King of 
Scotland,
 with
sword and composition got them from 
Magnus
 the fourth, King of 
Norway,
 which afterward King

Haquin
 confirmed vnto King 
Robert Bruce:
 but lastly, 
Christian
 the first, King of 
Norway
 and 
Den∣marke,

vtterly renounced all his right to those Ilands, when he gaue his daughter in marriage vnto
King 
Iames
 the third, which deed was further ratified by the Pope, who openeth the way to the pos∣session
of Kingdomes with his owne key.


(22) More North, and further then this Chart could well expresse, lie the Isles of 
Shetland,
 of
some thought to be 
Thule,
 and by the Commenter vpon 
Horace,
 the 
Fortunate Iland,
 where as 
Tzetz
s

fabuleth, the soules of good men are ferryed into those 
Elizia
 fields that euer grow greene, and
whence 
Iulius Caesar
 could hardly be drawne, as 
Muretus
 hath written: but their fictions intended
onely that the vertuous soules of the dead passed the vttermost bounds of earthly abode, and attai∣ned
to an ouer-pleasing repose, and euer-flourishing happinesse; which whether they horrowed from
the description of Paradise, (taken both for a faire Garden and the soules happy rest) I cannot de∣fine;
but sure they would not haue made those fields alwayes greene, if they had seene how they lye
euer couered with Ice and Snow, being in the 63. degree of Latitude, as 
Ptolemie
 hath placed it,
where (for the most part) is a continuall Winter: but for proofe that this was the 
Thule,
 besides

Ptolemies
 Positure, 
Saxo
 Grammaticus
 betwixt 
Norway
 and 
Scotland
 hath placed it; and 
Solin
,
 two
dayes sayling from the point of 
Caleoni
 and 
Tacitus
 saith, that the 
Romanes
 kenned 
Th
le
 a farre off,
as they sayled about 
Britaine
 by the 
Orcad
s:
 and lastly, 
Mela
 maketh it to face 
Berge
 a Citie in 
Nor∣way.














IRELAND DESCRIBED.
CHAPTER I.


THe Traditions of time haue deliuered vnto vs diuers names, whereby this famous Iland is
recorded to haue beene called: yet none of more faire probabilitie, then that of 
Orpheus, A∣ristotle

and 
Claudian,
 by whom it is named 
Ierna:
 by 
Iuuenal
 and 
Mela
 called 
Iuuerna:
 by 
Dio∣dorus
Siculus, Iris:
 by 
Martian
 of 
Heraclea, Ioyepnia:
 by 
Eustachius, Oyernia,
 and 
Bernia
 by
the natiue Inhabitants, 
Eryn:
 by the 
Britaines, Yuerdon:
 the 
Welsh-Bards
 in their Ballads,

Tiruolas Totidanan,
 and 
Banno:
 and by the 
English, Ireland.
 But from whence these diuersities were de∣riued,
arise many opinions. Doubtlesse it is, that 
Hibernia, Iuuerna,
 and 
Ouernia,
 came from 
Ierna,

spoken of by 
O
pheus
 and 
Aristotle;
 and the same 
Ierna,
 as also 
Iris, Iuerdhon,
 and 
Ireland,
 from 
Erin,

the terme that the Inhabitants now vse. From this 
Erin
 therefore (a word proper to the Nation)
the originall is most likely to be deduced.


(2) Some deriue 
Hiber
a
 from 
Hiberno tempore,
 that is, from the winter season; some from 
Hi∣berus

a 
Spaniard;
 some from a Duke named 
Irnalph;
 some againe from the ancient Riuer 
Iberus,
 and

 from 
Hiere,
 an 
Irish
 word, which signifieth the west, or a westerne coast, whence 
Erin
 may also
seeme to setch the deriuation: for it lieth furthest Westward of any Region in all 
Europe.
 As also for
that the Riuer running in the most remote west-part of this Iland, is in 
Ptolemy
 called 
Iernus:
 like as
the furthest Westerne Promontory in 
Spaine,
 from whence our 
Irish
 men came, is by 
Strabo
 called



Ierne,
 and the Riuer next vnto it, by 
Mela, Ierna:
 yea, and 
Spaine
 it selfe, for the Westerne situation,
is called 
Hesperia:
 the West-Cape of 
Africke, Hesperium;
 and in 
Germany, Westrich
 and 
Westphale

from their position haue their names. 
Postelius
 (a man that rather followed his owne fancy, then
the iudgement of others) fetcheth the originall of 
Ireland
 from the 
Hebrewes,
 as if 
Irin
 should be as
much as 
Iurin,
 that is, the 
Iewes
 land: which opinion I hold no better then those that would haue it
from the Winter-like stormes, although vpon euery winde the aire is cold there.


(3) 
Festus Auienus,
 in that little booke which he entituled 
Ora maritima
 calleth 
Ireland, Sacram
Insulam,
 that is, the holy Iland: to which opinion the people are soone drawne, by reason of the
many Saints that the Iland is said to produce, and the blessed soile that affords no venomous crea∣tures
to retaine life. It is thought that 
Plutarch
 meant 
Ireland
 by his 
Ogygia,
 for her great antiquitie;
and of latter times by 
sidore
 and 
Bede
 it was called 
Scots
 of those 
Scots
 that inhabited it: and that
thence the name of 
Scotland,
 together with the 
Scots
 themselues, came into 
Britaine.


(4) For largenesse and circuit, in times past, this Iland challenged the third place in ranke of
all the Iles of the then knowne world: for thus haue Geographers left vs, that the 
Indian Taproba

for greatnesse was the first, the Ile of 
Britaine
 the next, and this of 
Ireland
 the third: and for that cause
doth 
Ptolemy
 call it the little 
Britaine.
 But how soeuer 
Strabo
 hath extended the bredth, as broad as
the length, and others haue formed it in shape like an egge, yet latter dimensions haue found it farre
otherwise, twice longer then broad, and may be compared to the forelegge of a Beare, if the 
Si
ile

breed no offence. Whose East-side hath on it that tempestuous Sea that cutteth her channell betwixt

England
 and this 
Ireland:
 the West is washed with the Westerne Ocean; the North with the 


Caledonian;
 and the South with the 
Vergiuian Sea.


(5) The aire of this Iland is delectable and wholesome, though neither so cleere nor sub



of 
England,
 which (as 
Mela
 saith) is nothing fauourable for the ripening of Cor
e: but so
gratefull to the ground, that it causeth grasse to grow abund
ntly, not onely fresh and long, but
withall very sweet for all Cattle, and in Winter is more subiect to winde then snow: and that I may
vse the words of 
Giraldus, It is of all Countries most temperate, neither forcing the Inhabitants to seeke
shade from the frying heat of Cancer, nor the chilling cold of Capricorne to driue them to the fire:
 but at all
seasons most milde, betwixt a sufferable cold, and gentle warme heat.


(6) The soile (saith 
Cambrensis)
 is vneuen, wooddy, wilde, waterish and boggy, so full of Loghs
and Meeres, that great ponds of water are found vpon the high Mountaines. These indeed make the
places somewhat dangerous vnto all new commers, by breeding of rheums dyssenteries and fluxes,
whose vsuall remedie is 
Vskebah,
 a wholesome 
Aqua vita,
 that drieth more, and enflameth lesse,
then many other hot confections.


(7) The Commodities of this Kingdome chiefly consist in Cattle, whose feed is so sweet and so
ranke, that they will soone graze to a surfet, if they may be suffered to feed as they will. Their sheepe
are many, but beare not the best wooll, which twice are shorne within one yeare. Of these they make
Mantles, Caddowes, and Couerle
s, vented from thence into forraine Countries. Their Hobbies
likewise are of great esteeme, and are answerable to the 
ennets of 
Spaine.
 Bees are there in such a∣bundance,
that hony is found in holes of old trees, and in rests of the rockes. No annoyance of hurt∣full
Snake or venomous creatures; and to speake all in a word, nothing wanting for profit or plea∣sure:
for so much doth 
Giraldus
 affirme, in saying, that 
Nature had cast into this Westerne Kingdome of
Zephyrus a more gracious eye then was ordinary.


(8) Touching the originall peopling of this faire Iland, if we will beleeue their records, they
make antiquitie it selfe but young vnto themselues, affirming the damsell 
Caesarea,
 and niece vnto



Noah,
 to haue found it out before the Floud; and that three hundred yeares after; when 
Ia
hets
 po∣steritie
tooke into these West-parts of the world, one 
Barthela
 of his progeny, a 
S
ythian
 by birth,
encouraged by the late successe of 
N
rod
 (who now had intruded vpon the Monarchy of 
Syria)

wandred so farre West, that 
Fortune
 at last cast him and his people vpon the coast of 
Ireland.
 There
he setled with his three sonnes, 
Languinna, Salarus,
 and 
Ruthurgus,
 who searching through euery
creeke and corner of the Land, left their owne names by three notable places, 
Langui
, Stragrus,

and Mount 
Salanga,
 which the reuolution of times hath since called by other names, as S. 
Dominick∣hill,
Ruthurgi,
 and 
Stag
.
 Vnder the gouernment of these three sonnes, and their off-spring, this
land was kept about three hundred yeares; at which time there arriued also in 
Ireland
 a Giant-like
kinde of people of 
Nimrods
 race, who in bodily shape exceeded the proportion of vsuallmen, vsing
their strengths to winne 
 and to oppreste with rapine and violence. These growing to
numbers, accounted it neces
ary to preuent dominion, lest the curse of slauery (prophecied by 
Noah)

should light vpon them: to preuent the which, they set vp a King of their owne; then quarrels bred
daily, either parties purposing to hold their interest by their swords: against whom, lastly a battle was
fought, and an infinite company of Giants slaine▪ when also died most of those of the posteritie of

Iapheth,
 leauing them of 
Cham
 Lords of Iland.


(9) Whereupon 
Nemethus
 a 
Scythian,
 with his foure sonnes, arriued in 
Ireland,
 and by strong
hand seated themselues among these Grants; where for two hundred and sixtie yeares they kept, but
then no longer able to hold out against them, they left their standings, and departed the land.


(10) Soone after, the fiue sonnes of 
Dela,
 descended from the said 
Nemethus,
 came into these coasts,
and with manly prowes
e droue these miscreants out of 
Ireland,
 whereby the seed of 
Cham
 was vtterly
expelled, & these of 
Iapheth
 diuided the land into fiue parts, whereof they became themselues Kings:


but falling at variance, gaue aduantage vnto others, among whom the BRITAINES set in
a foot.


(11) But to make this Iland more famous, certaine Historians haue fetched their Kings from
most vncertaine Records, as namely from 
Gaothel
 the 
Grecian,
 and 
Scotia
 (the daughter of King 
Pha∣rao,

and nourisher of 
Moses)
 his wife: who at that time, when 
Israel
 were in 
Egypt,
 with a Colony
came into 
Spaine,
 and after into 
Ireland,
 where he was made King, and in honour of his Queene,
the land named 
Scotia,
 from whom also the Inhabitants tooke name: his posteritie increasing in the
parts of 
Spaine,
 where first they had seated, in proces
e of time sought further aduentures vnder the
foure sonnes of 
Milesius
 King of 
Spaine,
 whose names were 
Hibernus, Hermion, Euer,
 and 
Eri∣mon.


(12) These, by the direction sufferance, and assistance of 
Gurguntius,
 King of the 
Britaines,
 after
that 
Ireland
 had beene very much dispeopled by a contagious pestilence, seated themselues, and from
the eldest, 
Hiberius,
 called the I
and 
Hibernia,
 as some are of opinion: these diuided the whole into
fiue Pro
nces, famously knowne by the names of 
Mounster, Leinster, Connaught, Vlster,
 and 
M
ath

in their midst: and from these the present 
Irish
 repute themselues to come. Yet surely, as I make no
question, but that this Iland became inhabited euen of old time, when mankinde againe ouer-spred
the face of the earth, so doubt I not, but that our 
Britaines
 pas
ed thereinto themselues, such infinite
number of words in the 
Irish
 language yet in vse, such ancient names of Waters, Isles, Mountaines,
and places, meerely 
British
 words, yet remaining, and the testimony of 
acitus,
 who saith, that their
manners were fashioned to the 
Britaines,
 inforceth so much; and 
Ptolemy
 before him, calleth that I∣land
by the name of 
little Britaine:
 all which shew a former interest for 
Ireland,
 then that which by
conquest vnder 
Henry
 the second was made.



(13) That it euer was subiect to the 
Romans,
 is doubtfull, though 
Agricola
 did wish it, and 
Taci∣tus

held most necessary: yea, and in the diuision of their Empire, 
Ireland,
 with 
Britaine
 and 
Thule,
 fell
vnto 
Constantine
 the sonne of 
Constantine
 the great; yet their manners vnreclaimed, and barbarisme
retained long after those dayes, doe witnesse no such 
 sowne, to be in that plot. But when

Romes
 great Empire began to grow lesse, the 
Scots
 or 
Scythians
 grew mightie in 
Ireland:
 and as 
Oros

writeth, that Island was wholly inhabited by the 
Scotish
 Nation in the dayes of 
Honorius,
 and 
Ar
∣dius,

the Emperours: whose warres and slaughter, 
Claudian
 doth lightly touch in this his Verse.


Scotorum cumulos fleuit glacialis Ierne.


The frozen Ireland wept to see, her Scots all slaine on h
apes to be.


(14) 
As these for the most part, by the testimony of
 Ninius, 
were the ancient Inhabitants, so by
other ancient Writers, their customes and manners are thus set forth:
 Strabo 
saith,
 The Inhabitants
of 
Ireland
 are more rude then the 
Britaines,
 they feed vpon the flesh of men, yea, and thinke it a point of worth
to eat their dead parents: want only they accompany with women, making no difference of other mens wiues,
their owne sisters, nor of their naturall mothers: but of these things 
(saith he)
 we haue no certaine witnesse
of sufficient credit. Po
ponius Mela 
recordeth, that
 the 
Irish
 are vn
iuill, ignorant of vertues, and void
of religion: 
And
 Solinus 
affirmeth, that
 after victory they drinke the bloud of the slaine, and besmeare their
owne faces therewith; so giuen to warre, that the mother at the birth of a man-childe, feedeth the first meat
into her infants mouth, vpon the point of her husbands sword, and with he at
enish imprecations, wisheth that
it may die no otherwise then in warre or by sword.


(15) But from these ancient and barbarous manners, let vs come to the conditions of their mid∣dle
time; whom 
Giraldus Cambrensis
 describeth as followeth: 
The Irish
 (saith he) are a strong and bold



people, martiall and prodigall in warre, nimble, stout, and haughtie of heart; carelesse of life, but greedie of
glory; courteous to strangers, constant in loue, light of beliefe, impatient of iniurie, giuen to fleshly lusts, and
in enmitie implacable.
 At the baptizing of their Infants, their manner was, not to dip their right armes
into the water, that so (as they thought) they might giue a more deepe and incurable blow; neuer
calling them by the names of their Parents whilest they liued together, but at their death tooke it
vpon them. Their women nursed not the children they bare; and they that nursed others, did affect
and loue them much more then their owne.


(16) So much were they giuen to fantasticall conceits, that they held it very ominous to giue
their neighbours fire vpon 
May-day:
 to eat an old egge, endangered the death of their horse: and be∣fore
they cast in their seed, they send salt into the field: to hang vp the shelles in the roofe, was a
preseruatiue of the chickens from the kite: to set vp greene boughes at their doores in the Moneth
of May, increased their kines milke; and to spit vpon Cattle, they held it good against Witchery,
whereof 
Ireland
 was full.


(17) Superstitious Idolatry among the wilde 
Irish
 was common, yeelding diuine honour vnto
the Moone after the change, vnto whom they both bowed their knees, and made supplications; and
with a loud voice would thus speake vnto that Planet: 
Wee pray thee leaue vs in as good estate as thou
foundst vs.
 Wolues they did make their Godsibs, terming them 
Chari Christ,
 and so thought them∣selues
preserued from their hurts: the hoofes of dead horses they accounted and held sacred: about
childrens necks they hung the beginning of Saint 
Iohns
 Gospell, a crooked naile of an horse-shooe,
or a peece of a Wolues skinne; and both the sucking-childe and nurse were girt with girdles finely
plated of womans haire; so farre they wandred into the wayes of errour, in making these armes the
strength of their healths.


(18) Their wiues were many, by reason of diuorcements, and their maids married at twelue


yeares of age, whose customes were to send to their louers, bracelets plated, and curiously wrought of
their owne haire; so farre following 
Venus
 in the knots of these a
urements. The men wore linnen
shirts exceedingly large, stained with Saffron, the sleeues wide, and hanging to their knees, strait and
short trustes plated thicke in the skirts, their breeches close to the thighes, a short skeine hanging
point downe before, and a mantle most times cast ouer their heads. The women wore their haire
plated in curious manner, hanging downe their backes and shoulders, from vnder soulden wreathes
of fine linnen, rolled about their heads, rather loading the wearer, then delighting the beholder:
for as the one was most seemely, so the other was vnsightly: their neckes were hung with chaines
and carkaneths, their armes wreathed with many bracelets, and ouer their side-garments the shagge
rugge mantles purfled with a deepe Fringe of diuers colours, both sexes accounting idlenes
e their
onely libertie, and ease their greatest riches.


(19) In warres they were forward, and fought with battle-axes, whose bearers were called 
Gal∣loglasses,

the common Souldier but lightly armed, who serued with darts and sharpe skeines; their
Trumpet was a Bagge-pipe, and word for encounter, 
Pharroh;
 which at the first onset with great
acclamation they vttered, and he that did not, was taken into the ayre, and carried into the vale of

Kerr
,
 where transformed (as they did beleeue) he remained vntill he was hunted with Hounds
from thence to his home.


(20) For the dying and dead they hired women to mourne, who expostulated with the sicke,
why he would die; and dead, at his Funerall such out-cries were made, such clapping of hands, such
howlings, and gestures, that one would thinke their sorrowes vnrecouerable, holding the opinion
of 
Pythagoras
 for the soules departed.


(21) Their dyet in necessitie was slender, feeding vpon water-cresses, rootes, mushromes, sham∣rogh,
butter tempered with oat-meale, milke, whey, yea, and raw flesh, the bloud being crushed out:


their vse was also to let their kine bloud, which standing a while, and comming to a ielly, with but∣ter
they did eat, as a very good dish.


(22) That the Gospell of Christ should be preached in 
Ireland
 by 
Iames
 the Apostle, I will not
affirme, though 
Vincentius
 hath said it: neither will I, with the 
Scots,
 bring the Ilands conuersion from
a Christian woman, who (as their Historians doe auouch) first instructed the Queene, and the
Queene her husband, and he againe his Subiects, till all became Christians. But most true it is, that
the 
Scots
 first receiued the doctrine of Christ in this Kingdome of 
Ireland;
 for thus writeth 
Prosper:
Coelestin Pope of Rome sent his Archdeacon Palladius into Britaine to withstand the Pelagian heresie, who at
one time did driue out these enemies of grace, and ordained a Bishop among the Scots, whereby that barba∣rous
Nation embraced Christianitie.
 Yet 
Ninius
 reporteth, that 
Palladius
 did nothing in neither, being
taken away by vntimely death: but that S. 
Patricke,
 borne at 
E
burne
 in 
Cluedsdale,
 the sonne of 
Cal∣phurus,

by the sister of S. 
Martin,
 was the first Apostle for 
Ireland,
 who sowed his heauenly seede
with such plentifull increase, that the soile it selfe shortly was called 
Sanctorum Patria, the Country of
Saints:
 for whose Sepulchre after his death rose as great variance, as was for 
Homer
 amongst them
of 
Greece:
 they of 
Downe
 challenged his graue to be with them, vpon certaine Verses written on a
Tombe, which ascribes 
Patricke, Briget,
 and 
Columbe
 to be buried therein: they of 
Armagh
 lay claime
by the warrant of S. 
Bernard,
 who saith, that 
Patricke in his life time there ruled, and after death there
rested. Glascenbury
 in 
England
 by ancient records will haue his bodie interred with them; and 
Scot∣land

auoucheth his birth to be at 
Glasco,
 and bones to rest at 
Kirk-Patricke
 with them: of such reue∣rent
esteeme was this 
Irish
 Apostle.


(23) This 
Patricke
 in his youth had beene taken captiue by the 
Irish
 Pirats, and for sixe yeares
continuance serued 
Mac
uain
 as his slaue, and keeper of his swine: in which deiected condition, so
desirous he was of the Lands saluation, that in his dreames he thought the Infants vnborne cryed


vnto him for Baptisme; and redeeming himselfe thence for a peece of gold found in the field, which
a swine had turned vp, in his aged yeares came backe againe into 
Ireland,
 preached the Gospell, con∣uerted
the people, and lastly became Archbishop of 
Armagh.
 Of whose miracles and Purgatorie,
I leaue others to speake; that are more credulous in the one, and haue better leisure to relate the o∣ther,
and will shew thee 
Ireland
 as now it is, first in generall, and then in parts.













THE PROVINCE OF MOVNSTER.
CHAPTER II.


THis Prouince, called in 
Irish, Mown;
 in a more ordinary construction of speech, 
Wown;
 in

Latine, Momonia;
 and in 
English, Mounster;
 lieth open South ward to the 
Verginian Sea:

North-ward it affronteth part of 
Connaught:
 The East is neighboured by 
L
i
ster:
 and the
West is altogether washed with the West Ocean.


(2) The length thereof extended from 
Ballatimore
-Bay in her South, vnto the Bay of 
Gal∣way

in her North, are about nintie miles. Her broadest part from East to West, is from 
Waterford-Hauen

to 
Feriter Hauen,
 and containeth an hundred miles. The whole circumference, by following
the prometaries and indents, are aboue fiue hundred and fortie miles.


(3) The forme thereof is quadrant or foure-square. The 
 milde and temperate, neither too
chilling cold, not too scorching hot. The soyle in some parts is hilly, looking 
 with wooddy,
wilde, and solitary mountaines: yet the vallies below are garnished with Corne-fields. And gene∣rally,
all, both pleasant for fight, and fertile for soile.


(4) This Prouince is at this day diuided into two parts that is, the West-
Mounster,
 and the
South-
Mounster.
 The West-
Mounster
 was inhabited i
 old 
 by the 
 the 
Velabri,
 and the

Vteri
:
 the South-
Mounster
 by the 
Oudi
 or 
,
 and the 
Cori
ndi.
 The 
Velabri
 and 
 are said
(by 
Orosius)
 to haue dwelt in that part of the Country, where it lyeth outmost Westward, and pas∣sing
towards the 
Cantabrian
 Ocean, looketh a farre off to 
Gallitia
 in 
Spaine.
 The 
Luceni
 of 
Ireland

(who seeme to haue deriued their name and originall from the 
Lucen
 of 
Gall
tia,
 and of whom there
still remaine some reliques in the Barony of 
Lyxno
)
 are supposed to haue bin seated in those parts
that lie neighbouring vpon the banke of the Riuer 
Shemon.



(5) The generall Commodities of this Prouince, are Corne, Cattle, Wood, Wooll, and Fish.
The last whereof, it affords in euery place plenty & abundance of all sorts. But none so well knowne
for the store of Herrings that are taken there, as is the Promontory called 
Eraugh,
 that lies betweene

Bantre
 and 
Ballatimore
 Bay, whereunto euery yeare a great Fleet of 
Spaniards
 and 
Portugals
 resort
(euen in the middest of Winter) to fish also for Cods.


(6) The principall Citie of the Prouince is 
Limericke,
 which the 
Irish
 call 
Loumeagh,
 compassed
about with the famous Riuer 
Shennon,
 by the parting of the Channell. This is a Bishops See, and the
very Mart-Towne of 
Mounster.
 It was first wonne by 
Reymond le Grosse
 an 
Englishman,
 afterwards
burnt by 
Duncnald
 an 
Irish
 petty King of 
Thuetmond.
 Then in processe of time, 
Philip Breos
 an 
Eng∣lishman

was infeoffed in it, and King 
Iohn
 fortified it with a Castle, which he caused therein to be
built. In this Castle certaine Hostages making their abode in the yeare 1332 grew (as is reported)
so full of pride and insolency, that they flew the Constable thereof, and seized the Castle into their
owne hands. But the resolute Citizens, that could neither brooke nor beare with such barbareus
crueltie, did in reuenge then shew such manly courage and viuacitie, as they soone after recouered
the Castle againe, repaying the Hostages in such hostile manner, as that they put them all to the
sword without partialitie. The position of this Towne is by 
Mercator
 placed for Latitude 53. de∣grees
20. minutes; and for Longitude, 9. degrees and 34. minutes. Neere vnto the Riuer that 
Pto∣lemy

calleth 
Daucona,
 and 
Giraldus Cambrensis
 (by the alteration of some few letters) nameth 
Saura∣nus

and 
Sauarenus,
 which issueth out of 
Muskerey
 Mountaines, is seated the Citie 
Corke,
 graced also
with another Episcopall dignitie (and with the Bishops See of 
Clon
 annexed vnto it) which 
Giraldus

calleth 
Corragia,
 the 
Englishmen Corke,
 & the natiue Inhabitants of the Country 
Coreach.
 This Towne
is so beset on euery side with neighbouring molesters, as that they are still constrained to keepe
watch and ward, as if there lay continuall siege against it. The Citizens of this place are all linkt


together in some one or other degree of affinitie, for that they dare not match their daughters in
marriage into the Country, but make contracts of matrimony one with another among themselues.
In this place, that holy and religious man 
Briock
 is said to haue his birth and breeding, who flourished
among the 
Gaules
 in that fruitfull age of Christianitie, and from whom the Diocesse of 
Sanbr
och
 in

Britaine Armorua,
 commonly called S▪ 
Brieu,
 had the denomination.


(7) The Citie which the 
Irish
 and 
Britaines
 call 
Porthlargy,
 and the 
English, Waterford,
 though it
be last in place, yet is it not least in account, as being the second Citie of all 
Ireland,
 as well for the
conuenience and commodiousnesse of the Hauen, that affords such necessary aptitude for trade and
traffique, as also for the faithfull loyaltie which it hath alwayes shewed to the Imperiall Crowne of

England:
 for euer since it was wonne by 
Richard
 Earle of 
Pembrook
,
 it still performed the obedience
and peaceable offices of dutie and seruice vnto the 
English,
 as they continued their course in the con∣quest
of 
Ireland:
 whence it is that the Kings of 
England
 haue from time to time endowed it with
many large Franchises and Liberties, which King 
Henry
 the seauenth did both augment and con∣firme.


(8) Although since the time of S. 
Patricke,
 Christianitie was neuer extinct in this Country, yet
the gouernment being haled into contrary factions, the Nobility lawles
e, and the multitude wilfull,
it hath come to passe, that Religion hath waxed (with the temporall common sort) more cold and
feeble, being most of them very irreligious, and addicted wholly to superstitious obseruations: for in
some parts of this Prouince, some are of opinion, that certaine men are yearely turned into Wolues,
and made Wolfe-men. Though this hath beene constantly affirmed by such as thinke their censures
worthy to passe for currant and credible; yet let vs suppose that happily they be possessed with the
disease and maladie that the Physicians call Lycanthropy, which begetteth and engendreth such like
phantasies through the malicious humours of Melancholy: and so oftentimes men imagine them∣selues


to be turned and transformed into formes which they are not. Some againe embrace another
ridiculous opinion, and perswade themselues, that he who in the barbarous acclamation and outcry
of the Souldiers, which they vse with great forcing and straining of their voices, when they ioyne
battaile, doth not howte and make a noise as the rest doe, is suddenly caught from the ground, and
carried as it were flying in the ayre, out of any Country of 
Ireland,
 into some desert vallies, where he
feedeth vpon grasse, drinketh water, hath some vse of reason, but not of speech, is ignorant of the
present condition he stands in, whether good or bad: yet at length shall be brought to his own home,
being 
aught with the helpe of Hounds and Hunters. Great pitie that the foule fiend and father of
darknesse, should so grieuously seduce this people with misbeliefe, and that these errours be not cha∣sed
away with the truth of Christian Religion, whereby as they carry much grace in their counte∣nances,
they may also not be void of the inward grace of their soules and vnderstanding.


(9) This Prouince hath beene fore wasted in the rebellions of 
Desmond,
 to whose ayde Pope

Gregory
 the thirteenth, and 
Philip
 King of 
Spaine,
 sent certaine companies of 
Italians
 and 
Spaniards,

who arriued not farre from 
Dingle,
 fortified themselues, & gaue it the name of 
Fort de Ore,
 founding
loud threats against the whole Country. But 
A
ur
 
 
Grey,
 Lord Deputie of 
Ireland,
 at the
first onset decided their quarrell, by sheathing his sword in their bowels: and 
Desmond
 fearefully fly∣ing
into the woods, was by a Souldier cut shorter by the head. And againe, when the Kingdome of

Ireland
 lay bleeding, and put almost to the hazard of the last cast, 
Don Iohn D' Aquila,
 with 8. thou∣sand

Spaniards
 (vpon confidence of the excommunications of 
Pius
 the fift, 
Gregory
 the thirteenth,
& 
Clement
 the eight, 
Popes,
 all of them discharging their curses like vnto thunder bolts against Queene

Elizabeth
 of blessed memory) landed neere vnto 
Kinsale
 presuming that the rebellions of 
Tyrone
 had
turned the hearts of the 
Irish
 for 
Rome:
 Sir 
Charles Blunt
 Lord 
Montioy,
 in the depth of Winter, and
with his tired Souldiers, so d
nted their 
Spanish
 hearts, that with one victory he repressed their
bragging boldnesse, and recouered the 
Irish
 that were ready to reuolt.



(10) God hath oftentimes shewed his tender loue and affection to this people, in laying his fa∣therly
chastisements and afflictions vpon them, sometimes by windes, sometimes by famine and
dearth, and sometimes againe by opening his hand of plenty into their laps to conuert them to him∣selfe,
and to diuert their hearts from superstitions. In the yeare 1330 about the Feast of Saint 
Iohn


, there be an such a dea
th of Co
e in this Country, by the abundance of raine and the inun∣dation
of waters (which continued vntill 
Michaelmas
 following) that a Cranoc of Wheat was sold
for 
, a Cranoc of Oats for eight shillings, a Cranoc of Pease, Beanes, and Barley for
as much. 
 wind
s the same yeare were so mightie, that many were hurt, and many slaine outright
by the fall of houses that was forced by the violence of the same. The like whereof were neuer seene
in 
Ireland.
 In the yeare 1317 there was such a dearth of Corne and other victuals, that a Cranoc of
Wheat was sold for twentie three shillings. And many Housholders, that before time had sustained
and 
 a great number, were this yeare driuen to beg, and many famished. In the time of which

mine, the mercy of God so disposed, that vpon the 27. day of Iune, in the yeare 1331▪ there came
to land such a mightie multitude of great Sea-fishes (that is) 
Thursheds,
 such as in many ages past
had neuer beene seene, that the people were much comforted in this distresse, and receiued great re∣liefe
and sustenance by the same.


(11) Places of Rel
gion in this Country, were the two Abbies at 
Yoghall,
 called the 
North-Ab∣bey

and 
South-Abbey:
 The two Abbies at 
Limericke,
 S. 
Francis
 Abbey, and S 
Dominicke
 Abbey:
The two Abbies at 
Corke,
 the Abbey of the Ile, and S. 
Frances
 Abbey: and the famous Abbey (in
times past) of the holy Crosse which hath had many priuiledges and liberties granted vnto it, in ho∣nour
of a peece of 
Christs Crosse,
 that was (as they say) sometimes preserued there. Thus were Chri∣stians
perswaded in ancient times▪ And it is a wonder in what Troopes and Assemblies people doe
(euen yet) conflow thither vpon deuotion, as vnto a place of holinesse and sanct
e; so firmely are


they settled in the Religion of their Fore-fathers, which hath beene increased beyond all measure
by the negligent care of their Teachers, who should instruct their ignorance, and labour to reduce
them from the errors they perseuere in.


This Prouince is gouerned by a Lord President, who hath one assistant, twelue learned Lawyers,
and a Secretary to keepe it in dutie and obedience. It was in times past diuided into many parts,
as 
Towoun,
 that is, 
North-Mounster; Deswoun,
 that is, 
South-Mounster; Hierwoun,
 that is, 
West-Moun∣ster;
Mean-woun,
 that is, 
Middle Monaster;
 and 
Vrwoun,
 that is, the Front of 
Mounster.
 But at this
day it is distinguished into these Counties; 
Kerry, Desmond, Limericke, Tipperary, Holycrosse, Water∣ford,
and Corke:
 which County in times past had beene a Kingdome, containing with it 
Desmond

also: for so in the Grant giuen by King 
Henry
 the second vnto 
Robert Fitz-Stephen,
 and to 
Miles de
Cogan,
 it is called in these words: 
Know yee that I haue granted the whole Kingdome of Corke, excepting
the Citie and Cantred of the Oustmans, to hold for them and their heires, of me and Iohn my sonne, by the ser∣uice
of sixtie Knights.
 The County of 
Waterford,
 King 
Henry
 the sixt gaue vnto 
Iohn Talbot
 Earle of

Shrewsburie,
 with the name, stile, and title of 
Earle of Waterford,
 which was afterward againe assumed
to the Crowne. Touching the County of 
Holy-Crosse,
 as the opinion of that much frequented Ab∣bey
is much lessened, so that County is swallowed vp altogether in the County 
ipperary.
 It is for∣tified
with fiue strong Castles, traded with sixe Market-Townes, and diuided as followeth.

LEINSTER.
CHAPTER III.


THis Country, the Natiues call 
Leighnigh,
 the 
Britaines Lein;
 in 
Latine, Lagenia;
 in the anci∣ent
liues of the Saints, 
Lagen;
 and in 
English, Leinster.
 It lieth Eastward along 
Hibernicum

Sea: on 
Connaught
 side Westward it is bounded with the Riuer 
Shanon;
 the North with the
Territorie of 
Louth,
 and the South with part of the Prouince of 
Mounster.
 This Country
butteth vpon 
England,
 as 
Mounster
 and 
Connaught
 doe vpon 
Spaine.


(2) The forme thereof is triangle, and sides not much vnequall, from her South-East vnto the
West-point about 80. miles, from thence to her North-West about 70. miles, and her East Coast a∣long
the 
Irish
 Sea-shore, eightie miles: the circumference vpon two hundred and seauentie miles.


(3) The aire is cleare and gentle, mixt with a temperate disposition, yeelding neither extremitie
of heat or cold, according to the seasonable times of the yeare, and the naturall condition of the
Continent. The soile is generally fruitfull, plentifull both in fish and flesh, and in other victuals,
as butter, cheese, and mile. It is fertile in Corne, Cattle, and pasture grounds, and would be much
more, if the husbandman did but apply his industry, to which he is inuited by the commodiousnesse
of the Country. It is well watered with Riuers, and for the most part well woodded, except the
Countie of 
Diuelin,
 which complaines much of that want, being so destitute of wood, that they are
compelled to vse a clammie kinde of fat turffe for their fuell, or Sea-coale brought out of 
England.


(4) The Inhabitants of these parts in 
Ptolemies
 dayes were the 
Brigantes, Mena
, Cauci,
 and 
Bla∣in;

from which 
Blani
 may seeme to be deriued and contracted the latter and moderne names of this
Country, 
Lein, Leighnigh,
 and 
Leinster.
 The 
Mena
 (as the name doth after a sort imply) came from


the 
Menapians,
 a Nation in 
Low Germany,
 that dwelt by the Sea-Coasts. These 
Brigantes,
 ca
ed also

Birgantes, Florianus del Campo
 (a 
Spaniard)
 labours to fetch from the 
Brigants
 of his owne Country,
of whom an ancient Citie in 
Spaine
 (called 
Brigantia)
 tooke the name. But they may seeme rather
to deriue their denomination from the Riuer 
Birgus,
 about which they inhabited; for to this the ve∣ry
name is almost sufficient to perswade vs.


(5) The commodities of this Country doe chiefly consist in Cattle, Sea-fowle, and Fish. It
breeds many excellent good horses, called 
Irish Hobbies,
 which haue not the same pace that other
horses haue in their course, but a soft and round amble, setting very easily.


(6) This Country hath in it three Riuers of note, termed in old time the three sisters, 
Shour,
Neor,
 and 
Barraeo,
 which issue out of the huge Mountaine (called by 
Giraldus, Bladina Montes)
 as
out of their mothers wombe, and from their rising tops descending with a downefall into seuerall
Channels, before they emptie themselues into the Ocean, ioyne hand in hand all together in a mu∣tuall
league and combination.


(7) Places very dangerous for shipping are certaine fiats and shallowes in the Sea, that lie ouer
against Holy-point, which the Marriners call the 
Grounds.
 Also the shelues of sand that lie a great
way in length opposite to 
Newcastle,
 which ouer-looketh them into the Sea from the top of an high
hill adioyning.


(8) In this Prouince are placed many faire and wealthy Townes, as 
Kilkenny,
 which for a Bur∣rough-Towne
excels all the midland Burroughs in this Iland. 
Kildare,
 which is adorned with an E∣piscopall
See, and much graced in the first infancy of the 
Irish
 Church, by reason of Saint 
Bridgid
 a
venerable Virgin, had in great account and estimation for her virginitie and deuotion, as who was
the Disciple of S. 
Patricke
 of so great fame, renowne, and antiquite: Also 
Weisford
 (a name giuen
vnto it by these 
Germans,
 whom the 
Irish
 terme 
Oustmans)
 a Towne though inferiour to some, yet as


memorable as any, for that it became the first Colony of the 
English,
 and did first submit it selfe vnto
their protection, being assaulted by 
Fitz Stephen,
 a Captaine worthily made famous for his valour
and magnanimitie.


(9) But the Citie which fame may iustly celebrate alone, beyond all the Cities or Townes in

Ireland,
 is that which we call 
Diuelin, Ptole
ie Eblana,
 the 
Latinists Dublinium,
 and 
Dublinia;
 the 
West-Britaines,
Dinas Dulm;
 the 
English-Saxons
 in times past, 
Duplin;
 and the 
Irish, Balacleigh,
 that is, the
Towne vpon hurdles: for it is reported that the place being fennish and moorish, when it first began
to be builded, the foundation was laid vpon hurdles.


(10) That it is ancient, is perswaded by the authoritie of 
Ptol
mie.
 That it was grieuously rent
and dismembred in the tamultuous warres of the 
Danes,
 and brought afterwards vnder the sub
ecti∣on
of 
Eadgar
 King of 
England,
 (which his Charter also confirmeth, wherein he calleth it the noble
Citie of 
Ireland)
 is written by 
Saxo Grammaticus.
 That it was built by 
Harold
 of 
Norway,
 which
may seeme to be 
Harold Har
ager,
 when he had brought the greatest part of 
Ireland
 into an awfull
obedience vnto him, we reade in the life of 
Griffith ap S
an
 Prince of 
Wales.
 At length it yeelded
vnto the valour and protection of the 
English,
 at their first arriuall into 
Ireland,
 by whom it was man∣fully
defended from the fierce assaults as well of 
Auscoulph
 Prince of the 
D
blinians,
 as afterwards of

Gottard
 King of the Isles: since which time it hath still augmented her flourishing estate, and giuen
approued testimony of her faith and loyaltie to the Crowne of 
England,
 in the times of any tumul∣tuous
streights and commotions.


(11) This is the royall seat of 
Ireland,
 strong in her munition, beautifull in her buildings, and
(for the quantitie) matchable to many other Cities, frequent for trafficke and intercourse of Mer∣chants▪
In the East Suburbs, 
Henry
 the second, King of 
England
 (as 
H
ueden
 reporteth) caused a roy∣all
Pallace to be erected: and 
Henry Loundres,
 Archbishop of 
Diuelin,
 built a Store-house about the


yeare of Christ 1220. Not farre from it is the beautifull Colledge consecrated vnto the name of the
holy Trinitie, which Queene 
Elizabeth
 of famous memory dignified with the priuiledges of an V∣niuersitie.
The Church of S. 
Patricke
 being much enlarged by King 
Iohn,
 was by 
Iohn Comin
 Archbi∣shop
of 
Dublin,
 borne at 
Euesham
 in 
England,
 first ordained to be a Church of Prebends in the yeare
1191. It doth at this day maintaine a Deane, a Chanter, a Chancellor, a Treasurer, two Archdea∣cons,
and twentie two Prebendaries.


This Citie in times past, for the due administration of Ciuill Gouernment, had a Prouost for the
chiefe Magistrate. But in the yeare of mans redemption 1409 King 
Henry
 the fourth granted them
libertie to chuse euery yeare a Maior and two Bailistes, and that the Maior should haue a gilt sword
carried before him for euer. And King 
Edward
 the sixt (to heape more honour vpon this place)
changed the two Bailiffes afterwards into Sheriffes: so that there is not any thing here wanting that
may serue to make the estate of a Citie most flourishing.


(12) As the people of this County doe about the neighbouring parts of 
Diuelin
 come neerest
vnto the ciuill conditions and orderly subiection of the 
English:
 so in places farther off they are more
tumultuous, being at deadly feuds amongst themselues, committing oft times Man-slaughter one
vpon another, and working their owne mischiefes by mutuall wrongs: for so the 
Irish
 of 
Leinster
 wa∣sted

Leinster
 with many Townes in the same Prouince in the yeare 1294. And in the yeare 1301.
the men of 
Leinster
 in like manner raised a warre in the winter season, setting on fire the Towne of

Wyk
lo, Rathdon,
 and others, working their owne plague and punishment by burning vp their suste∣nance,
and losing their Castle by depredation.


(13) Matter of obseruation, and no lesse admiration among them, is the Giants dance, com∣monly
so called, and so much talked of, which 
Merlin
 is said by Art Magicke to haue translated out
of this Territorie vnto 
Salisburie
 Plaine: which how true it is, I leaue to the vaine beleeuers of mi∣racles,
and to the credulous obseruers of antiquitie.



(14) In this County haue beene erected many famous Monasteries, Abbies, and religious hou∣ses,
consecrated to deuout and holy purposes: As the Monastery of Saint 
Maries
 of 
Oustmanby,


ounded for preaching Friers, vnto which of late dayes the Iudiciall Courts of the Kingdome haue
beene translated: also the magnificent Abbey called S. 
Thomas
 Court at 
Dublin,
 builded and endow∣ed
in times past with many large priuiledges and reuenewes of King 
Henry
 the second, in expiation
of the murther of 
Thomas
 Arch-bishop of 
Canterbury.
 Likewise 
Tiutern
 Monastery, or the notable
Abbey which 
William Marshall
 Earle of 
Pembrooke
 founded, and called 
De roto,
 for that he had vowed
to God (being tossed at Sea with many a sore and dangerous tempest) to erect an Abbey where∣soeuer
he came to land, and being (after shipwracke) cast vpon land in this place, he made perfor∣mance
of his vow accordingly.


This Prouince containeth the Counties of 
Kilkenny, Caterlogh, Queenes Ceunty, Kings Countie, Kil∣dare,
East-Meath, West-Meath, Weisford,
 and 
Dublin
 (to say nothing of 
icklo
 and 
Fernes,
 which either
be already, or else are to be annexed vnto it) and subdiuided into ofreene Market-Townes. It hath
beene fortified with the strength of many Castles against the power of enemies, and is thus diui∣ded:

THE PROVINCE OF CONNAVGHT.
CHAPTER IIII.


THis Prouince named by 
Giraldus Cambrensis, Conachtia,
 and 
Conacia,
 by the 
Irish, Conaughty,

and by 
English-men, Connaught:
 is bounded East-ward, with part of the County of 
Leinster;

North-ward, with part of 
Vlster;
 West-ward, with the West-maine Ocean; and on the South,
it is confined with a part of the Prouince of 
Mounster,
 closed in with the Riuer 
Sbennon,
 and
butting against the Kingdome of 
Spaine.


(2) The forme thereof is long, and towards the North and South ends, thinne and narrow;
but as it growes towards the middle, from either part it waxeth still bigger and bigger: extending in
length from the Riuer 
Shennon
 in her South, to 
Enis Kelling
 in her North, 126. miles, and the broadest
part is from 
Tromer
 in her East, to 
Barragh-Bay
 in her West, containing about fourescore miles.
The whole in circuit and compasse is aboue foure hundred miles.


(3) The aire is not altogether so pure and cleare, as in the other Prouinces of 
Ireland,
 by reason
of certaine moist places (couered ouer with grasse) which of their softnesse are vsually termed
Boghes, both dangerous, and full of vaporous and foggie mists.


(4) This County as it is diuided into seuerall portions, so is euery portion seuerally commended
for the soile, according to the seasonable times of the yeare. 
Twomond
 or the County 
Clare,
 is said to
be a Country so conueniently situated, that either from the Sea or Soile there can be nothin wisht
for more, then what it doth naturally afford of it selfe, were but the industry of the Inhabitants an∣swerable
to the rest. 
Galway
 is a land very thankfull to the painefull husbandman, and no lesse com∣modious
and profitable to the Shepheard. 
Maio,
 in the 
Roman Prouinciall
 called 
Mageo,
 is repleni∣shed


both with pleasure and fertility, abundantly rich in Cattle, Deere, Hawkes, and plenty of Hony.

Slego
 (coasting vpon the Sea) is a plenteous Country for feeding and raising of Cattle. 
Le-Trim
 (a
place rising vp throughout with hilles) is so full of ranke grasse and forrage, that (as 
Solinus
 repor∣teth)
if Cattle were not kept sometimes from grasing, their fulnesse would endanger them. And

Rosco
en
 is a Territory, for the most part plaine and fruitfull, feeding many Heards of Cattle, and
with meane husbandry and tillage, yeelding plentie of Corne, As euery particular part is thus seue∣rally
profitable by in-bred commodities; so is it no lesse commended (in the generalitie) for the
many accomodate and fit Bayes, Creekes, and nauigable Riuers, lying vpon her Sea-coasts, that
after a sort inuite and prouoke the Inhabitants to nauigation.


(5) Such as in ancient time made their abode and habitations in this Prouince, were the GAN∣GANI,
who were also called CONCANI, AVTERI, and NAGNATAE. As the 
Luceni
 (that
were next neighbours vnto them) came from the 
Luceniji
 (in 
Spaine)
 so those 
Gangam
 and 
Coneani

may seeme also to haue fetcht their deriuation from the 
Concan
 (Nation of the selfe-same Coun∣try)
both by the affinitie of name, and vicinitie of place. In 
Strabo,
 according to the diuersitie of
reading, the same people are named 
Coniaci
 and 
Conisci:
 and 
Silius
 testifieth them at the first to haue
beene 
Scythians,
 and to haue vsed ordinarily to drinke horses bloud (a thing nothing strange among
the wilde 
Irish
 euen of late dayes.) And some may also happily suppose that the 
Irish
 name 
Conaugh∣ty,

was compounded of 
Concani
 and 
Nagnatae.
 Howsoeuer, it is sure that these were the ancient Inha∣bitants
of this Country, as is to be seene in 
Ptolemie.


(6) The principall Citie of this Prouince, and which may worthily be accounted the third in

Ireland,
 is 
Galway,
 in 
Irish, Galliue,
 built in manner much like to a Tower. It is dignified with a Bi∣shops
See, and is much frequented with Merchants, by reason whereof, and the benefit of the Road
and Hauen, it is gainfull to the Inhabitants through traffique and exchange of rich commodities,


both by Sea and Iland. Not farre from which, neere the West shoare that lies indented with small
in-lets and out lets in a row, are the Ilands called 
Arran,
 of which many a foolish fable goes, as if
they were the Ilands of the liuing, wherein none died at any time, or were subiect to moralitie;
which is as supersitious an obseruation, as that vsed in some other corners of the Country, where
the people leaue the right armes of their Infants males vnch
stned (as they terme it) to the end
that at any time afterwards, they might giue a more deadly and vngracious blow when they strike:
which things doe not onely shew how palpably they are carried away by traditious obscurities, but
doe also intimate how full their hearts be of inueterate reuenge.


(7) This 
ouince presents no matter more worthy of memory, then the battle of 
Knoe-toe

(that is) 
The 
ull of axes,
 vnder which, the greatest rabble of Rebels, that were euer seene before in

Ireland
 (raised and gathered together by the Arch-Rebels of that time, 
William Burk O Brien, Mac-Nomare,

and 
O-Carrol)
 were after a bloudy ouerthrow discomfited and put to flight by the noble
seruice of 
Girald F
z-G
rald
 Earle of 
ildare▪
 And the suppression of certaine 
Irish
 (the posteritie
of 
Mac-William)
 who vsurping a tyrannie in these parts, raged sometimes vpon themselues, with
mutuall iniuries, and oppressed the poore people a long time with extorting, pilling, and spoiling;
so as they left scarce one house in the Country vnrifled, or vnrased; but were bridled and repressed
(euen in our remebrance) by the seueritie and resolution of the Commissioner of those their
vniust doings, would be a meanes to draw the people away from the due obedience to their Prince:
such therefore as refused to obey the lawes, and sided with the tumultuous, with all care and dili∣gence
he soone scattered, forcing their Forts, and driuing them into woods and lurking holes (for
troubling the blessed estate of tranquilitie) till the Lord Deputie, who tooke pitie of them, vpon
their humble supplication, commanded by his missiues, that they should be receiued vpon tearmes


of peace. But they being a stiffenecked people, tooke armes againe, entred a-fresh into actuall re∣bellion,
draue away booties, made foule vprores, and vpon faire promises procured the aid of the

Scottish
 Ilanders, from out of the 
Hebrides:
 whereupon the Gouernour assembled an Armie, and
pursued them with such powerfull violence through the Woods and Forrests, that after sixe or sea∣uen
weekes, being grieuously hunger-bitten, they submitted themselues in all humilitie. The Auxi∣liarie
Forces also of the 
Scots,
 he by day and night affronted so neere, and followed so hardly, that
he put them to flight, after he had killed and drowned about three thousand of them in the Riuer

Moin.


(8) About the yeare 1316. there was such a great slaughter made of the 
Irish
 in this Prouince
of 
Connaught,
 through a quarrell that arose there betweene two Lords or Princes, that there were
slaine on both sides about foure thousand men; and so great a tribulation at that time came vpon
the people, that they did deuoure and eat one another, so as of 10000. there remained not aboue
200. liuing. And it is reported for truth, that the people were then so hunger-starued, that in
Church-yards they tooke the dead bodies out of their graues, and in their sculs boiled the flesh, and
fed vpon it: yea, and that women did eat their owne children. Thus appeared the ire and anger of
God, in punishing their sinnes, and seeking their conuersion.


(9) Places memorable, are, 
Inis Ceath,
 well knowne by the Monastery of 
Colman
 (a deuout Saint)
founded for 
Scots
 and 
Englishmen;
 and 
Inis Bouind,
 which 
Bede
 calleth, 
White Calse Isle.
 Also 
Ma
o,

a Monastery built (as 
Bede
 writeth) for thirtie men of the 
English
 Nation. Likewise the Barony of

Boile,
 vnder 
Carlew
 hilles, where in times past was a famous Abbey built, together with the Abbey
of 
Beatitude,
 in the yeare of grace 1152: These Abbeyes and Monasteries erected at the first for re∣ligious
seruices, and through ignorance and other obseurities diuerted since vnto superstitious vses,
are now made the ruines of time.



(10) The Prouince of 
Connaught
 is at this day strengthned with foureteene Castles, traded with
nine Market-Townes, and diuided as ensueth.

THE PROVINCE OF VLSTER.
CHAPTER V.


THis Prouince, called by our 
Welsh-Britaines Vltw,
 in 
Irish Cui Guilly,
 in 
Latine Vltonia,
 and 
V∣lidia,

in 
English V
sier;
 on the North is diuided by a narrow Sea from 
Scotland;
 South-ward
it extends it selfe to 
Connagh
 and 
Leinster;
 the East part lieth vpon the 
Irish
 Sea; and the West
part is continually beaten with the boisterous rage of the maine West Ocean. This Pro∣uince
and furthest part of 
Ireland,
 affronteth the 
Scotish Ilands,
 which are called the 
Hebrides,

and are scattered in the Seas betweene both Kingdomes; whose Inhabitants at this day is the 
Irish-Scot,

successour of the old 
Scythian.


(2) The forme thereof is round, reaching in length from 
Coldagh
-Hauen in her North, to 
Kil∣more

in her South, neere an hundred miles; and in bredth from 
Black-Abbey
 in her East, to 
Calebegh

point in her West, one hundred thirtie and odde miles: The whole in circumference, about foure
hundred and twentie miles.


(3) This Country seldome feeleth any vnseasonable extremities, the quicke and flexible windes
cooling the heat of Summer, and soft and gentle showers mollifie the hardnesse of the Winter.
Briefly, the frozen nor torrid Zone haue not here any vsurpation; the clouds in the aire very sweet
and pleasant, yea, and when they are most impure, are not vnwholesome, nor of long continuance,
the rough windes holding them in continuall agitation.


(4) This equall temperature causeth the ground to bring forth great store of seuerall Trees,
both fit for building, and bearing of fruit; plentifull of grasse for the feeding of Cattle, and is a∣bundantly
furnished with Horses, Sheepe and Oxen; the Riuers likewise pay double tribute, deepe
enough to 
arry Vessels either for pleasure or profit, and Fish great store, both for their owne vses,


and commoditie of others. 
Salmons
 in some Riuers of this County abound more in number then
in any Riuer of 
Europe.
 To speake (in generall) though in some places it be somewhat barren,
troubled with 
Loughes, Lakes,
 and thicke Woods, yet is it euery where fresh, and full of Cattle and
forrage, ready at all times to answer the husbandmans paines. But nature is there so little behol∣ding
to Art or Industry, that the various shew vpon bankes, the shady groues, the greene meadowes,
hanging hilles, and fields fit for Corne, (if they were manured) doe seeme to be angry with their
Inhabitants for suffering all to grow wild and harbarous, through their owne negligence.


(5) This Country in 
Ptolemies
 dayes was wholly possessed by the 
Volutij, Darni, Robogdji,
 and 
Er∣dini,

who branched and spred themselues into the seuerall parts that Island.


(6) The people of this Prouince were accustomed in controuersies and solemne protestations,
to sweare by S. 
Patrickes Staffe,
 which oath they feared more to breake, then if they had sworne by
the holy 
Euangelist▪
 Their ancient custome in making their King, was this: A white Cow was taken,
which the King must kill, and seeth the same in water whole, then must he bathe himselfe therein
starke naked; and sitting in the Cawdron wherein it was sod, accompanied with his people round
about him, he and they vsed to eat the flesh and drinke the broath wherein he sate, without cup, or
dish, or vse of hand. How farre these prescriptions and customes were different from the conformi∣ties
of other ciuill Monarchies, we may well perceiue by these and other like obseruations of those
grosse times, and as yet they are more barbarous then is any other part of the Island besides.


(7) Historians relating of 
Ireland,
 tell of seuerall Islands in the seuerall Prouinces: some full of
Angels, some full of Deuils; some for male onely, some for female; some where none may liue,
some where none can die; and such effects of trees, stones, and waters, that a man (but of easie con∣ceit)
may well esteeme them as heedlesse as vncertaine. So also S. 
Patrickes
 Purgatorie (a thing of
much note in the Tract of this Prouince) is a vault or narrow caue in the ground, 



(called 
Erne Liffer)
 much spoken of, by reason of (I wot not what) fearefull walking spirits and
dreadfull apparitions, (or rather some religious horrour) which (as some ridiculously dreame)
was digd by 
Vlysses
 when he went downe to parley with those in hell. This is the caue which the
Inhabitants in these dayes call 
llanu
 Frugadory,
 that is, 
The Isle of Purgatory,
 and S. 
Patricks Par∣gatory:

for some persons, lesse deuout then credulous, affirme that S. 
Patricke
 (or rather 
Patricius
Secundus
 an holy Abbot of that name) labouring the conuersion of the people of this Prouince,
and much inforcing the life to come, they replied contemptuously vnto him, that vnlesse they saw
proofes of those joyes and paines he preached, they would not lose the possession of their present
pleasures, in hope or feare of things to come, they wist not when Whereupon (as they say) he ob∣tained
at Gods hands by earnest prayer, that the punishments and torments which the godlesse are
to suffer after this life, might be there presented to the eye, that so he might more easily root out the
sinnes and Heathenish errours, that stucke so fast in the hearts of the 
Irish.
 But touching the credit
hereof (although common fame, and some records doe vtter it) I neither will vrge the beliefe,
nor regard, seeing it is no Article of our Creed.


(8) Matters memorable within this Prouince are these: first, that the Bishops of 
Ireland
 were
wont to be consecrated by the Archbishop of 
Canterbury
 in regard of the 
 which they had
in this Country; vntill such time as 
Iohn Pap
 a Cardinall was sent thither from Pop
 
Eugenius

the fourth, to reforme Ecclesiasticall discipline in this 
Iland,
 which 
 so loo
, that
there were translations, and pluralities of Bishops, according to the 
 and pleasure of the Metro∣politane▪
Also that the 
Irish-men
 were accustomed to leaue and forsake 
 wedded wiues at their
owne free willes, whereof 
Lanfrancke
 Archbishop of 
Canterbury
 complained vnto 
Theraelua
 a King
of 
Ireland.
 And had not this Nation beene corrupted with this vice, euen vnto these our dayes;
both the right of lineall succession had beene more certaine among them, and the Gentry and


Comminaltie had not in such cruelties imbrued themselues, with such effusion of their owne kin∣dreds
bloud, about their inheritances and legitimation.


(9) The principall place in this Tract is 
Armagh,
 neere vnto the Riuer 
Kalin,
 which (albeit it
maketh a poore shew) is the 
Archiepiscopall See
 and 
Metropolitane
 of the whole Island. Before Saint

Patricke
 had built there a faire Citie, for site, forme, quantitie, and compasse, modelled out (as he
saith) by the appointment and direction of Angels, this place was named 
Drumfalrch;
 the 
Irish
 tell
much that it receiued the name of Queene 
Armacha:
 but the better opinions are, that it is the same
which 
Bede
 calleth 
Dearmach,
 and out of the 
Scotish
 and 
Irish
 language interpreteth it, 
The Field of
Oakes.
 Here (as S. 
Bernard
 writeth) S. 
Patricke
 the Apostle of 
Ireland
 ruled in his life time, and
rested after death: in honor of whom it was of such venerable estimation in old time, that not one∣ly
Bishops and Priests, but Kings also and Princes were (in generall) subiect to the Metropolitane
thereof in all obedience, and to his gouernment alone. Among the Archbishops of this Prouince,
S. 
Malachy
 is famoused, who first prohibited Priests marriage in 
Ireland,
 and (as S. 
Bernard
 saith,
who wrote his life at large) borrowed no more of the natiue barbarousnesse of that Country, then

Sea-fishes
 doe saltnesse of the Seas. Also 
Richard Fitz Ralf
 (commonly called 
Armachanus)
 is of
famous memory, who turning the edge of his stile, about the yeare 1355. began to oppose his opi∣nion
against the Order of 
Mendicant Friers,
 as detesting in Christians such voluntary begging. The
chiefe Fort in this Tract is 
Enis Kelling,
 defended by the Rebels in the yeare 1593 and wonne by

Dowdall
 a most valiant Captaine: neere vnto which is a great downfall of water, termed 
The Salmon
Leape:
 of which there is a common speech currant among the Inhabitants, that it was once firme
ground very populous and well husbanded with tillage; till it was suddenly ouer flowne with wa∣ters,
and turned into a Lake, for some filthy abominable acts of the people against Nature com∣mitted
with beasts.



(10) The places of Religion, sequestred from other worldly seruices, and consecrated to holy
purposes, erected in this Prouince, were: The Abbey which sheweth it selfe at 
Donegal:
 The Mona∣stery
of 
Derie,
 where the 
Irish
 Rebell 
Shane O-N
al
 receiued such an ouerthrow (by 
Edward Randolph,

renowned for his seruice in the behalfe of his Country) that he could neuer after recouer the losse he
sustained at that time: The Monastery neere vnto the Riuer 
Laffer:
 The famous Monastery at the
Bay of 
Knockfergus,
 of the same institution, name, and order, as was that ancient Abbey in 
England,

neere vnto 
Chester,
 called 
Danchor:
 Also 
Mellifont
 Abbey, founded by 
Donald
 a King of 
Vriel,
 and
much commended by S 
Bernard:
 And lastly, the most renowned Monastery, built at 
Armagh
 in the
yeare of our Saluation 610. out of which very many Monasteries were afterwards propagate both
in 
Britaine
 and 
Ireland.
 These places were farre and neere frequented and sought vnto by great con∣fluences
of 
Pilgrims,
 till Time proued their deuotions to be erronious, and the pure light of the word
reuealed, opening the eyes of their vnderstanding, hath taught them to shake off the shame of such
Superstitions.


(11) That the people of this County might be kept within the bounds of their dutie, this Pro∣uince
hath beene secured with fiftie sixe Castles and Forts; and for trade of commerce, nine Mar∣ket-Townes
appointed, being diuided into these Counties ensuing.
