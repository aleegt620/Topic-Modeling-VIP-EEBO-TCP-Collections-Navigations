Amusements
SERIOUS
AND
COMICAL.




The PREFACE.


Amusement I.


THE Title I have confer'd up∣on
my Book, gives me Au∣thority
to make as long a
Preface as I please; for a
Long Preface is a true 
Amusement.



However I have ventured to put
one here, under the Apprehension that
it will be very necessary toward the
understanding of the Book; tho' the
Generality of Readers are of Opini∣on,
that a Preface, instead of setting
off the Work, does but expose the
Vanity of the Author.


A good General of an Army, is less
embarrass'd at the Head of his Troops,
than an ill Writer in the Front of his
Productions. He knows not in what
Figure to dress his Countenance. If
he puts on a Fierce and Haughty
look, his Readers think themselves
obliged to lower his Topsail, and
bring him under their Sterns: If he
affects an Humble Sneaking Posture,
they slight and despise him: If he
boasts the Excellency of his Subject,
they believe not a Syllable of what
he says: If he tells them there is lit∣tle
or nothing in't, they take him at
his Word; and to say nothing at all
of his Work, is an unsufferable Impo∣sition
upon an Author.


I know not what Success these Pa∣pers
will find in the World; but if any
amuse themselves in Criticizing up∣on
them, or in Reading them, my
Design is answer'd.



I have given the following
Thoughts the Name of 
Amusements;

you will find them Serious, or Comi∣cal,
according to the Humour I was
in when I wrote them; and they will
either Divert you, Instruct you, or
Tire you, after the Humour you are
in when you read them.


T'other Day one of the Imaginary
Serious Wits, who thought it a Weak∣ness
in any Man to laugh: Seeing a
Copy of this Book; at the opening
of it, fell into a Passion, and Wrink∣ling
up his Nostrils like a heated Stal∣lion
that had a Mare in the Wind, said,
The Book was unworthy of the Ti∣tle;
for Grave Subjects, should be
treated with Decorum, and 'twas to
profane Serious Matters, to blend
them with Comical Entertainments.
What a Mixture is here says he!


This Variety of Colours, said I
to my Censurer, appears very Natu∣ral
to me; for if one strictly examines
all Mens Actions and Discourses, we
shall find that Seriousness and Merri∣ment
are near Neighbours, and al∣ways
live together like Friends, if
Sullen Moody Sots do not set them at
Variance. Every Day shews us, that
Serious Maxims, and Sober Counsels,


often proceed out of the Mouths of
the Pleasantest Companions, and such
as affect to be always Grave and
Musing, are then more Comical than
they think themselves.


My Spark push'd his Remonstrance
further: Are not you ashamed, con∣tinued
he, to Print 
Amusements?

Don't you know, that Man was made
for Business, and not to sit amusing
himself like an Owl in an Ivy-Bush?
To which I answer'd after this man∣ner.


The whole Life of Man is but one
entire Amusement: Vertue only de∣serves
the Name of Business, and
none but they that practise it can be
truly said to be employed, for all the
World beside are Idle.


One Amuses himself by Ambition,
another by Interest, and another by
that Foolish Passion Love. Little Folks
Amuse themselves in Pleasures, Great
Men in the Acquisition of Glory, and
I am Amused to think that all this is
nothing but Amusement.


Once more, the whole Transa∣ctions
of our Lives, are but meer
Amusements, and Life it self is
but an Amusement in a continued Ex∣pectation
of Death.



Thus much for Serious Matters:
Let us now make haste to Pleasan∣try.


I have a great mind to be in Print;
but above all, I would fain be an Ori∣ginal,
and that is a true Comical
Thought: When all the Learned Men
in the World are but Translators, is it
not a Pleasant Jest, that you should
strive to be an Original! You should
have observed your Time, and have
come into the World with the An∣cient

Greeks
 for that purpose; for
the 
Latines
 themselves are but Co∣pies.


This Discourse has mightily dis∣couraged
me. Is it true then that
there is such an Embargo laid upon
Invention, that no Man can produce
any thing that is perfectly New, and
intirely his own? Many Authors, I
confess, have told me so: I will
enquire further about it, and if
Sir 
Roger,
 Mr. 
Dryden,
 and Mr. 
Dur∣fey

Confirm it, then I will Believe
it.


What need all this Toyl and Clut∣ter
about Original Authors and Tran∣slators?
He who Imagines Briskly,
Thinks Justly, and Writes Correctly,
is an Original in the same things that


another had thought before him. The
Natural Air, and Curious Turn he
gives his Translations, and the Ap∣plication
wherewith he graces them,
is enough to perswade any Sensible
Man, that he was able to think and
perform the same things, if they had
not been thought and done before
him, which is an advantage owing to
their Birth, rather than to the Excel∣lency
of their Parts beyond their Suc∣cessors.


Some of our Modern Writers, that
have built upon the Foundation of
the Ancients, have far excell'd in dis∣guising
their Notions, and improving
the first Essays, that they have ac∣quir'd
more Glory, and Reputation,
than ever was given to the Original
Authors: Nay, have utterly effaced
their Memories.


Those who Rob the Modern Wri∣ters,
study to hide their Thefts; those
who filch from the Ancients, account
it their Glory. But why the last
should be more Reproach'd than the
former, I cannot imagine, since there
is more Wit in disguising a Thought
of Mr. 
Lock
's, than in a lucky Tran∣slation
of a Passage from 
Horace.
 Af∣ter
all, it must be granted, that the


Genius of some Men can never be
brought to Write correctly in this
Age, till they have form'd their Wits
upon the Ancients, and their Gusts
upon the Moderns; and I know no
reason, why it should be their
Disparagement, to capaciate them∣selves
by these Helps to serve the
Publick.


Nothing will please some Men, but
Books stuff'd with Antiquity, groan∣ing
under the weight of Learned Quo∣tations
drawn from the Fountains:
And what is all this but Pilfering.
But I will neither Rob the Ancient,
nor Modern Books, but Pillage all I
give you from the Book of the
World.


The Book of the World is very
Ancient, and yet always New. In all
Times, Men, and their Passions, have
been the Subjects. These Passions
were always the same, tho' they have
been delivered to Posterity in different
Manners, according to the different
Constitution of Ages; and in all A∣ges
they are Read by every one, ac∣cording
to the Characters of their
Wit, and the Extent of their Judg∣ment.



Those who are qualified to Read
and Understand the Book of the
World, may be beneficial to the Pub∣lick,
in communicating the Fruit of
their Studies; but those that have no
other knowledge of the World, but
what they collect from Books, are
not fit to give Instructions to o∣thers.


If the World then is a Book that
ought to be read in the Original:
One may as well compare it to a

Country
 that one cannot know, nor
make known to others, without Tra∣veling
through it himself. I began
this Journey very Young: I always
loved to make Reflections upon every
thing that presented it self to my
View: I was amused in making these
Reflections: I have amused my self
in Writing them: And I wish my
Reader may Amuse himself in Read∣ing
them.


Some will think it another Amuse∣ment
to find a Book without a Dedica∣tion,
begging the Protection of a Migh∣ty
Patron, and by some fulsome kind of
Flattery, expose the Great Man, the
Author intended to praise; but that I
have avoided, by sending the Brat na∣ked
into the World to shift for it self.


It was not design'd to give any Man
Offence. Innocent Mirth, compoun∣ded
with Wholsome Advice, is the
whole Burthen it travails with; and
therefore the Author flatters himself
with the hopes of pleasing all Men:
Which is a Pitch if his Book arrives
to, will be the greatest Amusement in
the World.








Amusement II.




The Voyage of the World.


THERE is no Amusement so en∣tertaining
and advantageous, as
improving some of our Leisure Time
in Traveling. If any Man for that rea∣son
has an Inclination to divert him∣self,
and Sail with me round the Globe,
to supervise almost all the Conditions
of Humane Life, without being infe∣cted
with the Vanities, and Vices that
attend such a Whimsical Perambulati∣on;
let him follow me, who am go∣ing
to Relate it in a Stile, and Lan∣guage,
proper to the Variety of the
Subject: For as the Caprichio came
Naturally into my Pericranium, I am
resolv'd to pursue it through Thick
and Thin, to enlarge my Capacity
for a Man of Business.



Where then shall we begin? In the
Name of Mischief what Country will
first present it self to my Imagination?

He Bien!
 I have hit upon't already:
Let's Steer for the 
Court,
 for that's
the Region which will furnish us with
the finest Lessons for our Knowledge
of the World.






The COVRT.


THE Court is a Country abound∣ing
with Amusements. The
Air they breath there, is very fine
and subtile; only for about three
parts and a half of four in the Year,
'tis liable to be Infected with Gross
Vapours full of Flattery and Ly∣ing.
All the Avenues leading to it
are Gay, Smiling, Agreeable to the
Sight, and all end in one and the
same Point, Honour, and Self-Inte∣rest.


Here Fortune keeps her Residence,
and seems to expect that we make
our Addresses to her, at the bottom


of a long Walk, which lies open to all
Comers and Goers. One would be
apt to think at first sight, that he might
reach the End on't, before he could
count Twenty; but there are so ma∣ny
By-Walks and Allies to cross, so
many Turnings and Windings to find
out, that he is soon convinced of his
Mistake. 'Tis contrived into such an
Intricate Maze and obscure manner,
that the Straitest Way is not always
the Nearest. It looks Gloriously in
the Country, but when you approach
it, its Beauty diminishes.


After all the Enquiry I have made
about it, I am not able to satisfie your
Curiosity, whether the Ground it
stands upon be firm and solid. I have
seen some New Comers tread as con∣fidently
upon it, as if they had been
Born there; but quickly found they
were in a New World, where the tot∣tering
Earth made them Giddy and
Stumble: For tho' they knew Good
and Evil were equally useful to their
Advancement, yet were so confound∣ed,
to know which of the two they
ought to employ to make their For∣tunes,
that for want of understand∣ing
only that pretty knack, they
made a Journey to Court only to go


back again, and report at Home they
had the Honour of seeing it. On the
other side, I have seen some Old Sta∣gers
walk upon Court Ground, as
gingerly as upon Ice, or a Quagmire:
And with all the Precaution and Fear
imaginable, lest they should fall from
a great Fortune by the same Defects
that rais'd them: And not without
cause, for the Ground is Hard in some
Places, and Sinks in others; but all
People covet to get upon the highest
Spot, to which there is no coming
but by one Passage, and that is so nar∣row,
that no Ambitious Pretender
can keep the Way, without Justling
other People down with his Elbows:
And the further Mischief on't is, that
those that keep their Feet, will not
help up those that are fallen: For 'tis
the Genius of a true 
Courtier
 not to
lend a Hand, or part with a Farthing
to one that wants every thing; but
will give any thing to him that wants
nothing: Or rather will lay up for a
Rainy Day, because what he sees be∣fal
another to Day, may be his own
Turn to Morrow.




He a stout Heart should have, and
Steady Head,


That in a dangerous Slipery Path does
tread;


And 'tis the Court that Slipery Place
I call,


Where all Men Slip, and very few
but fall.


The Difficulties we meet with in
this Country, are very surprizing;
for he takes the longest Way about,
that keeps the old Track of Honesty
and True Merit; for where the Ad∣dress
of some, does not help to make
the Fortune of others, immediately
to Eclipse his Desert, Calumny rai∣ses
the thickest Clouds, Envy the
Blackest Vapours, and the Candidate
is lost in the Fog of Competitors,
and must hide himself behind a Fa∣vourites
Recommendation, if ever he
hopes to obtain what he seeks for: So
that Vertue is no longer Vertue, nor
Vice Vice, but every thing is con∣founded
and eaten up by particular
Interests.


A new comer, with his Pockets
well lined, is always welcome to any
Court in 
Christendom,
 and every thing


is provided for him without his own
Trouble. He neither Acts nor Speaks,
and yet they admire him as a very
Wise Man: First, because he is so
Foolish to hear them Talk Imperti∣nently,
and next because there is no
little Wisdom in his Modesty and Si∣lence;
for had he Acted or Spoke ne∣ver
so little, they wou'd soon have
found out the Coxcomb.


He that holds a Courtier by the
Hand, has a Wet Eel by the Tail. He
no sooner thinks he is sure of him,
but he has lost him. Tho' you pre∣sented
him in the Morning, he will
forget you at Night, and utterly Re∣nounce
you the Day following. A
profest Courtier, tho he never aims at
the Peace of God, is past any Man's
Understanding. He is incomparably
skill'd in Modish Postures, and Mo∣deling
his Looks to every occasion:
Profound and Impenetrable, can Dis∣semble
when he does Ill Offices, Smile
an Enemy to Death, Frown a Friend
into Banishment, put a Constraint up∣on
his Natural Temper, act against
his own Inclination, Disguise his Pas∣sions,
Rail against his own Principles,
Contradict his own Opinion, and by
a Brillant Humour, convert a Friendly


Openness and Sincerity, into a Sly
Chicanry and Falshood.


Is it not a great Amusement, that a
Man which can subsist upon his own,
should throw himself into the two
great Plagues of Mankind, Expecta∣tion
and Dependance, and spend his
Life in an Anti-chamber, a Court-Yard,
or a Stair-Case, where he finds
no Advantage or Content; but is also
hindred from finding it elsewhere.


Is it not strange, I say, to see a
great Man that lives and is respected
in his own Country like a Prince,
Haunt the Court to make himself lit∣tle
by Comparison, and bow to those
little Animals at the Palace, whose
Creeping, Cringing, and long Servi∣ces,
are all the Merits they can pre∣tend
to. Let the Courtiers value
themselves upon their refined Plea∣sures,
their Power and Interest: Their
being able to do Good by Chance,
and Evil by Inclination; yet he that
is under no Necessity of living preca∣riously,
or mending his present Cir∣cumstances,
'tis an Amusement to see
him Dance Attendance for a single Of∣fice
at Court, that has so many at his
own Disposal in the Country.



And now let's take our Leave of all
the Courts in 
Europe,
 and hoist Sail
for 
London;
 the Chiefest City in all

Christendom▪
 where we shall find Mat∣ter
enough to Amuse our selves, tho'
we should live as long as 
Mathuse∣la.










Amusement III.


LONDON.


LONDON is a World by it self.
We daily discover in it more
New Countries, and surprizing Sin∣gularities,
than in all the Universe
besides. There are among the 
Lon∣doners

so many Nations differing in
Manners, Customs, and Religions,
that the Inhabitants themselves don't
know a quarter of them. Imagine
then what an 
Indian
 wou'd think of
such a Motly Herd of People, and
what a Diverting Amusement it would
be to him, to examine with a Travel∣ler's
Eye, all the Remarkable Things
of this Mighty City. A Whimsy
now takes me in the Head, to carry
this Stranger all over the Town with
me: No doubt but his Odd and Fan∣tastical
Ideas, will furnish me with


Variety, and perhaps with Diver∣sion.


Thus I am resolv'd to take upon
me the Genius of an 
Indian,
 who
has had the Curiosity to Travel hi∣ther
among us, and who had never
seen any thing like what he sees in

London.
 We shall see how he will
be amazed at certain things, which
the Prejudice of Custome makes
to seem Reasonable and Natural to
us.


To diversifie the Stile of my Nar∣ration,
I will sometimes make my
Traveller speak, and sometimes I will
take up the Discourse my self. I will
represent to my self the abstracted
Ideas of an 
Indian,
 and I will likewise
represent ours to him. In short, ta∣king
it for granted, that we two un∣derstand
one another by half a Word,
I will set both his and my Imaginati∣on
on the Ramble. Those that won't
take the Pains to follow us, may stay
where they are, and spare themselves
the trouble of reading further in the
Book; but they that are minded to
Amuse themselves, ought to attend
the Caprice of the Author for a few
Moments.



I will therefore suppose this 
Indian

of mine, dropt perpendicularly from
the Clouds, and finds himself all on
the sudden in the midst of this Prodi∣gious
and Noisy City, where Repose
and Silence dare scarce shew their
Heads in the Darkest Night. At first
Dash the confused. Clamours near

Temple-Bar,
 Stun him, Fright him,
and make him Giddy.


He sees an infinite Number of dif∣ferenr

Machines,
 all in violent Moti∣on.
Some Riding on the Top, some
Within, others Behind, and 
Iehu
 in
the Coach-Box before, whirling some
Dignify'd Villain towards the Devil,
who has got an Estate by Cheating
the Publick. He Lolls at full Stretch
within, and half a Dozen Brawny
Bulk-begotten Footmen behind. Some
Carry, others are Carry'd: 
Make
Way there,
 says a Gouty-Leg'd Chair∣man,
that is carrying a Punk of Qua∣lity
to a Mornings Exercise: Or
a 
Bartholomen.
 Baby Beau, newly
Launch'd out of a Chocolate-House,
with his Pockets as empty as his
Brains. 
Make Room there,
 says ano∣ther
Fellow driving a Wheel-Barrow
of Nuts, that spoil the Lungs of the
City Prentices, and make them Wheeze


over their Mistresses, as bad as the
Phlegmatick Cuckolds their Masters
do, when call'd to Family Duty. One
Draws, another Drives. 
Stand ap there,
you Blind Dog,
 Says a Carman, 
Will you
have the Cart squeeze your Guts out?

One Tinker Knocks, another Bawls,

Have you Brass Pot, Iron Pot, Kettle,
Skillet, or a Frying-Pan to mend:
 Whilst
another Son of a Whore yells louder
than 
Homer
's Stentor, 
Two a Groat,
and Four for Six Pence Mackarel.
 One
draws his Mouth up to his Ears, and
Howls out, 
Buy my Flawnders,
 and is
followed by an Old Burly Drab, that
Screams out the Sale of her 
Maids
 and
her 
Sole
 at the same Instant.


Here a Sooty 
Chimney-Sweeper
 takes
the Wall of a Grave 
Alderman;
 and a

Broom-Man
 Justles the 
Parson
 of the
Parish. There a Fat Greasie 
Porter,

runs a Trunk full Butt upon you,
while another Salutes your Antlers
with a Flasket of 
Eggs
 and 
Butter.
Turn out there you Country Put,
 says a

Bully
 with a Sword two Yards long
jarring at his Heels, and throws him
into the Channel. By and by comes
a 
Christning,
 with the 
Reader
 and the

Midwife
 strutting in the Front, and
Young Original Sin as fine as Fip∣pence,


followed with the Vocal Mu∣sick
of 
Kitchen-Stuff ha' you Maids;

and a Damn'd 
Trumpeter
 calling in the
Rabble to see a 
Calf
 with Six Legs
and a Top-knot. There goes a 
Fune∣ral,

with the Men of Rosemary after
it, licking their Lips after their three
Hits of White, Sack, and Claret at
the House of Mourning, and the 
Sex∣ton

walking before, as Big and Bluff
as a 
Beef-Eater
 at a Coronation. Here's
a 
Poet
 scampers for't as fast as his Legs
will carry him, and at his Heels a
Brace of 
Bandog Bayliffs,
 with open
Mouths ready to Devour him, and
all the Nine Muses. Well, say I to
the 
Indian;
 And how do you like
this Crowd, Noise, and Perpetual
Hurry?


I admire and tremble, says the poor
Wretch to me. I admire that in so
narrow a Place, so many Machines,
and so many Animals, whose Motions
are so directly Opposite or Different,
can move so dexterously, and not fall
foul upon one another. To avoid all
this danger, shews the Ingenuity of
you 
Europeans;
 but their Rashness
makes me tremble, when I see Brute
heavy Beasts hurry through so many
Streets, and run upon slippery une∣ven


Stones, where the least faise
Step brings them within an Ace of
Death.


While I behold this Town of 
Lon∣don,

continues our Contemplative
Traveller, I fancy I behold a Prodigi∣ous
Animal. The Streets are as so ma∣ny

Veins,
 wherein the People Circu∣late.
With what Hurry and Swift∣ness
is the Circulation of 
London
 per∣form'd?
You behold, say I to him,
the Circulation that is made in the
Heart of 
London,
 but it moves more
briskly in the Blood of the 
Citizens,

they are always in Motion and Acti∣vity.
Their Actions succeed one ano∣ther
with so much Rapidity, that they
begin a Thousand Things before they
have finish'd one, and finish a thou∣sand
others before they have begun
them.


They are equally uncapable both
of Attention and Patience, and tho'
nothing is more quick, than the Ef∣fects
of Hearing and Seeing; yet they
don't allow themselves time either to
Hear or See; but like Moles, work
in the Dark, and Undermine one ano∣ther.



All their Study and Labour is either
about Profit, or Pleasure; and they
have Schools for the Education of
their Stalking-Horses, which they call

Apprentices
 in the Mystery of 
Trade.

A Term unintelligible to Foreigners,
and that none truly understand the
Meaning of, but those that practice
it.


Some call it 
Over-witting those they
deal with,
 but that's generally denied
as a Heterodox Definition; for 
Wit

was never counted a 
London
 Commo∣dity,
unless among their Wives, and
other City Sinners; and if you search
all the Warehouses and Shops, from

White-Chappel
 Bars, to St. 
Clement
's,
if it were to save a Man's Life, or a
Womans Honesty, you cannot find
one Farthing worth of 
Wit
 among
them.


Some derive this Heathenish Word

Trade
 from an 
Hebrew
 Original, and
call it 
Over-Reaching,
 but the 
Iews
 de∣ny
it, and say the Name and Thing is
wholly 
Christian;
 and for this Inter∣pretation
quote the Authority of a

London Alderman,
 who sold a 
Iew
 five


Fats of Right-handed Gloves, without
any Fellows to them, and afterwards
made him purchase the Left-handed
ones to Match them, at double the
Value.


Some call 
Trade, Honest Gain,
 and to
make it more Palatable, have lacker'd
it with the Name of 
Godliness;
 and
hence it comes to pass, that the Ge∣nerality
of 
Londoners
 are accounted
such Eminent Professors; but of all
Guessers, he comes nearest the Mark,
that said Trade was playing a Game
at 
Losing Loadum,
 or dropping 
Fools

Pence into 
Knaves
 Pockets, till the

Sellers
 were Rich, and the 
Buyers
 were
Bankrupts.


About the Middle of 
London,
 is to
be seen a Magnificent Building, for
the Accommodation of the 
Lady Trade

and her Heirs and Successors for ever,
so full of Amusements about Twelve
a Clock every Day, that one would
think all the World was converted in∣to
News-Mongers and Intellingencers,
for that's the first Salutation among
all Mankind that frequent that Place.
What News from 
Scandaroon
 and



Aleppo?
 says the 
Turkey
 Merchant.
What Price bears Currants at 
Zant?

Apes at 
Tunis?
 Religion at 
Rome?

Cutting a Throat at 
Naples?
 Whores
at 
Venice?
 And the Cure of a Clap
at 
Padua?


What News of such a Ship? says
the 
Insurer.
 Is there any hope of her
being Cast away, says the 
Adventu∣rer,

for I have Insured more by a
Thousand Pounds, than I have in her?
So have I through Mercy, says a se∣cond,
and therefore let's leave a Let∣ter
of Advice for the Master, at the
New Light-House at 
Plimouth,
 that
he does not fail to touch at the 
Good-win-Sands,

and give us Advice of it
from 
Deal,
 or 
Canterbury,
 and he shall
have another Ship for his Faithful
Service as soon as he comes to 
Lon∣don.


I have a Bill upon you, Brother,
says one 
Alderman
 to another. Go
Home, Brother, says the other, and
if Money and my Man be Absent, let
my Wife pay you out of her Privy-Purse,
as your 
Good Wife
 lately paid
a Bill at Sight for me, I thank her
Ladyship.



Hark you, Mr. 
Broker,
 I have a
Parcel of Excellent Log-Wood, Block-Tin,
Spiders Brains, Philosophers
Guts, 
Don Qnixot
's Windmills, Hens-Teeth,
Ell-Broad Pack-Thread, and
the Quintescence of the Blue of
Plumbs. Go you Puppy, you are
fit to be a Broker, and don't know
that the 
Greshamites
 buy up all these
Rarities by Wholesale all the Year,
and Retail them out to the Society e∣very
first of 
April.


Hah, Old Acquaintance! 
Touch
Flesh:
 I have have been seeking thee
all the 
Change
 over. I have a pressing
Occasion for some Seeds of Sedition,

Iacobite Rue,
 and 
Whig Herb of Grace,

Can'st furnish me? Indeed lau, No;
saith the Merchant. I have just part∣ed
with them to the several Coffee-Houses
about the Town, where the
respective Merchants meet that Trade
in those Commodities; but if you
want but a small Parcel, you may
be supplied by Mrs. 
Bald—n,
 or 
Da—y

and his Son-in-Law 
Bell and Clapper,

and most Booksellers in 
London
 and

Westminster.
 Da, da, I'll about it im∣mediately.
Stay a little Mr,—, I
have a Word in private to you. If
you know any of our 
Whig
 Friends


that have occasion for any Stanch
Votes for the Choice of Mayors or
Sheriffs, that were Calculated for the
Meridian of 
London,
 but will serve in∣differently
for any City, or Corpora∣tion
in 
Europe,
 our Friend Mr. 
Pars—l

has abundance that lie upon his Hands,
and will be glad to dispose of them
a good Pennyworth. Enough said,
They are no Winters Traffick, for tho'
Mayors and Woodcocks come in a∣bout

Michaelmas,
 they don't lay Sprin∣ges
for Sheriffs till about Midsummer,
and then we'll talk with him about
those weighty Matters.


There stalks a Sergeant and his
Mace, smelling at the Merchants
Backsides, like a Hungry Dog for a
Dinner.


There walks a Publick 
Notary
 tied
to an lnkhorn, like an Ape to a Clog,
to put off his Heathen-Greek Com∣modities,
Bills of Store, and Charter
Parties.


That Wheezing Sickly Shew with
his Breeches full of the Prices
of Male and Female Commodities,
Projects, Complaints, and all Misma∣nagements
from 
Dan
 to 
Beersheba,
 is
the 
Devil's Broker,
 and may be spo∣ken
withal every 
Sunday
 from Eleven


in the Morning, till Four in the After∣noon,
at the next 
Quakers Meeting,
 to
his Lodging, and not after; for the
rest of his time on that Day he em∣ploys
in adjusting his Accompts, and
playing at 
Back-Gammon
 with his Prin∣cipal.


There goes a Rat-catcher in state,
Brandishing his Banner like a Blacka∣more
in a Pageant on the Execution-Day
of Rost Beef, Greasie Geese, and
Custards.


And there Sneaks a Hunger-starv'd

Usurer
 in quest of a Crasie Citizen
for Use and Continuance-Money,
which the other shuns as carefully as a
Sergeant, or the Devil.


Now say I to my 
Indian,
 Is not all
this Hodge-Podge a Pleasant Confusi∣on,
and a Perfect Amusement? The
Astonish'd Traveller reply'd, Without
doubt the Indigested 
Chaos
 was but an
imperfect representation of this con∣gregated
Huddle. But that which
most Amuses my Understanding, is to
hear 'em speak all Languages, and talk
of nothing but Trucking, and Bar∣tering,
Buying and Selling, Borrow∣ing
and Lending, Paying and Recei∣ving,
and yet I see nothing they have
to dispose of unless those that have


them, fell their Gold Chains, the
Braziers their Leathern Aprons, the
Young Merchants their Swords, or
the Old Ones their Canes and Oaken-Plants,
that support their Feeble Car∣cases.
That doubt, quoth I to my in∣quisitive

Indian,
 is easily solved, for tho
their Grosser Wares are at Home in
their Store-Houses, they have many
Things of Value to Truck for, that
they always carry about them: As
Justice for Fat Capons to be delivered
before Dinner, A Reprieve from the
Whipping-Post, for a Dozen Bottles
of Claret to drink after it. Licences
to sell Ale for a Hogshead of Stout to
his Worship; and leave to keep a Cof∣fee-House,
for a Cask of 
Cold Tea
 to
his Lady. Name but what you want,
and I'll direct you to the Walks
where you shall find the Merchants
that will Furnish you. Would you
buy the Common Hunt, the Common
Cryers, the Bridge-Master's, or the
Keeper of 
Newgate
's Places? Stay
till they fall, and a Gold-Chain, and
a Great Horse will direct you to the
Proprietors. Would you buy any
Naked Truth, or Light in a Dark-Lanthorn?
Look in the 
Wet-Quakers
Walk.
 Have you occasion for Comb-Brushes,


Tweezers, Cringes, or Com∣plements,

A la mode?
 The 
French Walk

will supply you. Want you Old
Cloaks, Plain Shooes, or Formal Gra∣vity?
You may fit your self to
a Cows-Thumb among the 
Spani∣ards.


Have you any Use in your Coun∣try
for Upright Honesty, or Down∣right
Dealing? You may buy plenty
of them both among the 
Stock-Iob∣bers,

for they are dead Commodities,
and that Society are willing to quit
their Hands of them.


Would you lay out your 
Indian

Gold for a 
New Plantation?
 Enquire
for the 
Scotch Walk,
 and you buy a
Good Pennyworth in 
Darien:
 Three
of your own Kings, for as many New

Hats,
 and all their Nineteen Subjects
into the Purchase, to be delivered at
the 
Scotch East-India Office,
 by Parson

Pattison,
 or their Secretary 
Wisdom
Webster.
 If you want any Tallow,
Rapparee's Hides, or 
Popish
 Massa∣cres,
enquire in the 
Irish Walk,
 and
you cannot lose your Labour: But I
am interrupted.


Look! Yonder's a 
Iew
 treading upon
an 
Italian's
 Foot, to carry on a Sodo∣mitical
Intrigue, and Bartering their


Souls here, for Fire and Brimstone in
another World.


See, there's a Beau that has Play'd
away his Estate at a Chocolate-House,
going to Sell himself to 
Barbadoes,
 to
keep himself out of 
Newgate,
 and
from Scandalizing his Relations at

Tyburn.


There's a Poet Reading his Verses.
and squeezing his Brains into an A∣morous
Cits Pockets, in hopes of a
Tester to buy himself a Dinner.


Behind that Pillar is a 
Welch Herald

deriving a Merchant's Pedigree from

Adam
's Great Grandfather, to entitle
him to a Coat of Arms, when he
comes to be Alderman.


But now the 
Change
 began to emp∣ty
so fast, I thought 'twas time to
troop off to an Eating-House; but
my 
Indian
 pull'd me by the Sleeve to
satisfie his Curisioty, why they stain'd
such stately Pillars with so many Dir∣ty
Papers. I told him, they were
Advertisements. Why, says he, don't
they put them into the 
Post-Boy?
 Can't
the Folks in this Country read it?
Pray let me know the Contents of
some of these Serawls.



Why first here is a 
Ship
 to be sold,
with all her Tackle and Lading,
There are Vertuous Maidens that are
willing to be Transported with 
William
Penn
 into 
Merriland,
 for the Propoga∣tion
of 
Quakerism.
 In another is a

Tutor
 to be Hired, to instruct any Gen∣tleman's,
or Merchant's Children in
their own Families: And under that
an Advertisement of a 
Milc-Ass,
 to
be sold at the Night-Mans in 
White-Chappel.


In another Colume in a 
Gilded-Frame

was a Chamber-Maid that wanted
a Service; and over her an Old Batche∣lor
that wanted a House-keeper. On the
sides of these were two lesser Papers,
one containing an Advertisement of a
Red-Headed Monkey lost from a Seed-Shop
in the 
Strand,
 with two Guineas
Reward to him or her that shall bring
him Home again with his Tail and
Collar on. On the other side was a
large Folio fill'd with Wet and Dry
Nurses; and Houses to be Lett; and
Parrots, Canary-Birds, and Setting-Dogs
to be sold.


They Way to my Lodging lay
through 
Cheapside,
 but dreading the
Canibal Man-catchers at the 
Counter-Gate,

that suck the Blood, and pick


the Bones of all the Paupers that fall
into their Clutches; nay, are worse
than Dogs, for they'll Devour one a∣nother;
I Tack'd about, and made a
Trip over 
Moor-fields,
 and Visited our
Friends in 
Bedlam.


A Pleasant Piece it is, and abounds
with Amusements; the first of which
is the Building so stately a Fabrick for
Persons wholly unsensible of the Beau∣ty
and Use of it: The Outside is a
perfect Mockery to the Inside, and
admits of two Amusing Queries:
Whether the Persons that ordered the
Building it, or those that Inhabit it,
were the Maddest? And whether the
Name and Thing be not as disagreea∣ble
as Harp and Harrow? But what
need I wonder at that, since the whole
is but one Intire Amusement: Some
were Preaching, and others in full
Cry a Hunting. Some were Praying,
other Cursing and Swearing. Some
were Dancing, others Groaning. Some
Singing, others Crying, and all in
perfect Confusion. A sad Represen∣tation
of the greater Chimerical World,
only in this there's no Whoring,
Cheating, nor Sleeping, unless after
the 
Platonick
 Mode in Thought, for
want of Action. Here were 
Persons



Confined that having no Money nor
Friends, and but a small Stock of
Confidence, run Mad for want of
Preferment. A 
Poet
 that for want of
Wit and Sense, run Mad for want of
Victuals, and a Hard-favour'd 
Citi∣zens
Wife,
 that lost her Wits because
her Husband kept a Handsome Mi∣stress.


In this Apartment was a 
Common
Lawyer
 Pleading; in another a 
Civili∣an

Sighing; a third enclosed a 
Iacobite

Ranting against the Revolution; and
a fourth a Morose Melancholy 
Whig,

bemoaning his want of an Office, and
complaining against Abuses at Court,
and Mismanagements.


Missing many others, whom I
thought deserved a Lodging among
their Brethren, I made Enquiry after
them, and was told by the Keeper,
they had many other Houses of the
same Foundation in the City, where
they were disposed of till they grew

Tamer,
 and were qualified to be ad∣mitted
Members of this 
Soberer
 So∣ciety.
The Projectors, who are ge∣nerally
Broken Citizens, were coop'd
up in the 
Counters
 and 
Ludgate.
 The
Beaus, and Rakes, and Common
Mad Gilts, that labour under a 
Furor


Uterini
 in 
Bridewell,
 and Justice 
Long
's
Powdering-Tub; and the Vertuosi
were confined to 
Gresham-College.

Those, continued he, in whose Con∣stitutions
Folly has the Ascendant o∣ver
Frenzy, are permitted to Reside,
and be Smoaked in Coffee-Houses;
and those that by the Governors of
this Hospital, are thought Utterly In∣curable,
are shut up with a pair of
Foils, a Fiddle, and a Pipe, in the
Inns of Court and Chancery; and
when their Fire and Spirits are exhau∣sted,
and they begin to Dote, they
are removed by 
Habeas Corpus
 into a
certain Hospital built for that purpose
near 
Amen-Corner.


Walking from hence, I had leisure
to ask my 
Indian
 his Opinion of these
Amusements, who after the best man∣ner
his Genius would suffer him, ha∣rangued
upon Deficiency of Sence,
as the only Beneficial Quality, since
the bare pretence to 
Wit
 was attended
by such Tragical Misfortunes, as Con∣finement
to Straw, Small Drink, and
Flogging.


Hearing a Noise as we approached
near 
Cripplegate
 Church, my Curiosi∣ty
lead me into the Inside of it, where
Mr. 
Sm—ys
 was Holding-forth a∣gainst


all the Vices of the Age, but
Whoring and Midwifery; for such a
stretch of Extravagancy had lost both
his own and his Wifes Fees at 
Christen∣ings,

and Stuffing their Wembs at

Churchings:
 And you know none but
Poets and Players decry their own
way of Living. He was very Hea∣venly
upon Conjugal Duties and
Chastity, for a reason you may ima∣gine:
Press'd Filial Obedience and
Honesty, with as much Vigour, as if
his own Sons had been his Auditors:
But above all, laid out himself as pow∣erfully
in exciting his Hearers to be
Charitable to the Poor, as if himself
had been the 
Iudas
 and the Bag-bearer.
Now


I that am always more scared at
the sight of a 
Sergeant,
 or 
Bayliff,

than at the Devil and all his Works,
was mortally frighted in my Passage
through 
Barbican
 and 
Long-Lane,
 by
the Impudent 
Ragsellers,
 in those Scan∣dalous
Climates, who laid hold of my
Arm to ask me, 
What I lack'd?
 At
first it made me Tremble worse than a
Quaker in a Fit of 
Enthusiasm,
 imagin∣ing
it had been an Arrest; but their
Rudeness continuing at every Door,
relieved me from those Pannick Fears;



Uterini
 in 
Bridewell,
 and Justice 
Long
's
Powdering-Tub; and the Vertuosi
were confined to 
Gresham-College.

Those, continued he, in whose Con∣stitutions

and those that by the Governors of

with 
What ye buy, Sir, What ye lack?

I threw him from my Sleeve into the
Kennel, saying, Tho' I want nothing
out of your Shops, methinks you all
want good Manners and Civility, that
are ready to tear a New Sute from my
Back, under pretence of selling me an
Old one: Avant Vermin, your Cloaths
smell as rankly of 
Newgate
 and 
Tyburn,

as the Bedding to be sold at the 
Ditch∣side

near 
Fleet-Bridge,
 smells of a Baw∣dy-House
and Brandy.


Smithfield
 would next have afforded
us variety of Subjects to descant upon;
but it being neither 
Bartholomew-Fair

Time, nor Market-Day, I shall ad∣journ
that View to another opportu∣nity;
and now proceed to,








Amusement IV.


Westminster-Hall.


A Magnificent Building, which is
Open to all the World, and
yet in a Manner is shut up, by the
Prodigious Concourse of People, who
Crowd and Sweat to get in or out, and
happy are they that don't leave their
Lives, Estates, nor Consciences be∣hind
them.


Here we entered into a great 
Hall,

where my 
Indian
 was surprized to see,
in the same Place, Men on the one side
with Bawbles and Toys, and on the
other taken up with the Fear of Judg∣ment,
on which depends their inevi∣table
Destiny.


In this Shop are to be sold Ribbons
and Gloves, Towers and Commodes,
by Word of Mouth: In another Shop
Lands and Tenements are disposed of
by Decree.



On your Left Hand you hear a nim∣ble
Tongu'd Painted 
Sempstress,
 with
her Charming Treble, Invite you to
buy some of her Knick-Knacks: And
on your Right, a Deep-mouth'd Cry∣ar
commanding Impossibilities, 
viz.

Silence to be kept among Women and
Lawyers. What a Fantastical Jargon
does this Heap of Contrarieties a∣mount
to?


While our Traveller is making his
Observations upon this Motly Scene,
he's frighted at the Terrible Approa∣ches
of a Multitude of Men in Black
Gowns, and Round Caps, that make
between them a most Hideous and
Dreadful Monster, call'd 
Pettyfogging,

of which there is such store in 
Eng∣land,

that the People think themselves
obliged to pray for the 
Egyptian
 Lo∣custs,
and Catterpillars, in exchange
for this kind of Vermin. And this
Monster bellows out so pernicious a
Language, that one Word alone is suf∣ficient
to ruine whole Families.


At certain Hours appointed, there
appears Grave and Dauntless Men,
whose very Sight is enough to give
one a Quartan-Ague, and who says
this Monster on his Back.



Scarce a Day passes over their
Heads, but they rescue out of his
greedy Jaws some Thousand of Acres
half devoured.


This Cursed Petty-Fogging is much
more to be feared than Injustice it self.
The latter openly undoes us, and af∣fords
us at least this Comfort, That
we have a Right to bewail our selves;
but the former by its Dilatory Forma∣lities,
rob us of all we have, and tells
us for our Eternal Despair, that we
suffer by Law.


Justice, if I may so express my self,
is a Beautiful Young Virgin Disguis'd,
brought on the Stage by the 
Plea∣der,

Pursued by the 
Artorney,
 Cajol'd
by the 
Counsellor,
 and Defended by the

Iudge.


Some Pert Critick will tell me now
that I have lost my way in Digressi∣ons.
Under favour, this Critick is in
the wrong Box, for Digressions pro∣perly
belong to my Subject, since
they are all nothing but Amusements;
and this is a Truth so uncontested, that
I am resolved to continue them.


By way of Digression, I must here
inform you, that in all those Places
of my Voyage, where the 
Indian
 per∣plexes
me with his Questions, I will


drop him, as I have already done, to
pursue my own Reflexions: Upon this
Condition however, that I may be al∣lowed
to take him up again, when I
am weary of Travelling alone. I will
likewise make bold to quit the Meta∣phor
of my Voyage, whenever the
Fancy takes me; for I am so far from
confining my self like a Slave to one
particular Figure, that I will keep the
Power still in my Hands, to change if
I think fit at every Period, my Fi∣gure,
Subject, and Stile, that I may
be less tiresom to the Modern Reader;
for I know well enough, that Variety
is the Predominant Taste of the pre∣sent
Age.


Altho' nothing is durable in this
Transitory World, yet 'tis observ'd,
that this Saying proves false in 
West∣minster-Hall,

where there are things
of eternal continuance, as Thousands
have found true by Woful Experience,
I mean 
Chancery
 Suits. Certain Sons
of Parchment, call'd Sollicitors and
Barristers, make it their whole Busi∣ness
to keep the Shuttle-Cock in mo∣tion,
and when one Hand is weary of
it, they Play it into another. 'Tis
the chiefest part of their Religion to
keep up and animate the Differences


among their Clyents, as it was with
the Vestal Virgins in the Days of

Yore,
 to maintain the Sacred Fire.


'Tis a most surprizing thing that
notwithstanding all the Clamour, Squa∣ling,
and Bawling there is in the
Courts, yet you shall have a Judge
now and then take as Comfortable a
Nap upon the Bench, as if he was at
Church; and every Honest 
Christian

has reason to pray, that as often as a
Cause comes to be heard, the Judges
of Ancient Times were Awake, and
the Modern Fast Asleep.


However this must be said for them,
that they are Righteous enough in
their Hearts; but the Devil on't is,
that they can't tell which way to take
to instruct themselves in the Merits of
the Cause. The Contending Parties
are suspected by them, the Solicitor
embroils them, the Counsellor Deaf∣ens
them, the Attorney Importunes
them, and (is it not a sad thing?) the
Shee-Sollicitor Distracts them. Well!
Let what will happen on't, give me
for my Money the Female Sollici∣tor.


A certain Judge in the Days of

Yore,
 made his Boasts one Day, that
the most Charming Woman in the


World, was not able to make him
forget that he was a Judge. Very
likely, Sir, said a Gentleman to him;
but I'll lay Twenty to One on Nature's
side. The Magistrate was a 
Man
 be∣fore
he was a 
Iudge.
 The first Moti∣on
he finds is for the Shee Solicitor,
and the Second is for 
Iustice.


A very Beautiful 
Countess
 went to a
Morose Surly Judge's Chamber, to
prepossess him in Favour of a very
Unrighteous Cause, and to Sollicite
for a 
Colonel,
 against a Tradesman that
Sued him.


This Tradesman happened that ve∣ry
Moment to be in his Lordship's
Closet, who found his Cause to be
so Just, and Clear, that he could not
forbear to promise him to take care he
should carry the Day.


The Words were no sooner out of
his Mouth, but our Charming 
Coun∣tess

appear'd in the Anti-Chamber.
The 
Iudge
 immediately run as fast as
his Gouty Legs would give him leave
to meet her Ladyship. Her 
Eyes,
 her

Air,
 her 
Graceful
 Deportment, the
Sound of her 
Voice,
 so many Charms
in short, pleaded so powerfully in her
Favour, that at the first Moment he
found the 
Man
 too Powerful for the



Iudge,
 and he promised our 
Countess,

that the 
Collonel
 should gain his Cause.
Thus you see the Poor Judge engaged
on both sides. When he came back to
his Closet, he found the 
Tradesman
 re∣duc'd
to the last Despair. I saw her,
cries the Fellow as it were out of his
Wits. I saw the 
Lady
 that solicits a∣gainst
me, and Lord what a Charm∣ing
Creature she is? I am undone my
Lord, my Cause is lost and ruin'd!
Why, says the Judge, not yet recover∣ed
from his Confusion, imagine your
self in my Place, and tell me if 'tis pos∣sible
for frail Man to refuse any thing
that so Beautiful a Lady asks? As he
spoke these Words, he pull'd a 
Hun∣dred
Pistols
 out of his Pocket, which
amounted to the Sum the Tradesman
sued for, and gave them to him. By
some means or other the 
Countess
 came
to the knowledge of it; and as she
was Vertuous even to a Scruple, she
was afraid of being too much obliged
by so Generous a Judge, and immedi∣ately
sent him a Hundred Pistoles.
The 
Colonel
 full as Gallant as the 
Coun∣tess

was Scrupulous, paid her the
Sum aforesaid; and thus every one
did as he ought to do. The Judge was
afraid of being 
Unjust,
 the Countess


feared to be too much obliged, the
Collonel paid, and the Tradesman
was satisfied: Or according to our old

English
 Adage, all was well, 
Iack
 had

Ioan,
 and the Man had his Mare a∣gain.


Shall I give you my Opinion of
this Judge's Behaviour. The first Mo∣tion
he found in himself, was for the
Charming 
Sollicitrix,
 which I can∣not
Excuse him for; and the second
was for 
Iustice,
 for which I Admire
him.


While I thus amus'd my self, my
Traveller is lost in a Fog of Black-Gowns;
let us go and find him. Oh
yonder he is at the farther end of the

Hall,
 I call to him, he strives to come
to me, but his Breath fails him, the
Crowd over-presses him, he's carri∣ed
down the Stream, he Swims upon
his Elbows to get to Shoar.


At last half Spent, and dripping
from every Pore in his Body, he
comes up to me, and all the Relation
I could get from him of what he
had seen, was; Oh this Counfound∣ed
Country! Let us get out of it as
soon as possibly we can, and never see
it more.



Come, come, says I to him, let's
go and Refresh our selves after this
Fatigue; and to put the Idea of the

Hall
 out of our Heads, let's go this
Evening into the Delicious Country
of 
Opera.








Amusement V.


The Play-House.


THE 
Play-House
 is an Inchanted
Island, where nothing appears
in Reality what it is, nor what it
should be. 'Tis frequented by Per∣sons
of all Degrees and Qualities
whatsoever, that have a great deal of
Idle Time lying upon their Hands,
and can't tell how to employ it wor∣ser.
Here 
Lords
 come to Laugh, and
to be Laugh'd at for being there, and
seeing their Qualities ridicul'd by eve∣ry
Triobolary Poet. Knights come
hither to learn the Amorous Smirk,
the 
Ala mode
 Grin, the Antick Bow,
the Newest-Fashion'd Cringe, and how
to adjust his Phiz, to make himself as
Ridiculous by Art, as he is by Na∣ture.



Hither come the Country Gentle∣men
to shew their Shapes, and trou∣ble
the Pit with their Impertinence
about Hawking, Hunting, and their
Handsome Wives, and their House-wifery.


There sits a 
Beau
 like a Fool in a
Frame, that dares not stir his Head,
nor move his Body, for fear of in∣commoding
his Wig, ruffling his Cra∣vat,
or putting his Eyes, or Mouth
out of the Order his 
Maitre de Dance

had set it in, whilst a 
Bully Beau
 comes
Drunk into the Pit, Screaming out,

Dam me,
 Jack, 
'tis a Confounded Play,
let's to a
 Whore 
and spend our time bet∣ter.


Here the Ladies come to shew their
Cloaths, which are often the only
things to be admir'd in or about 'em.
Some of them having Scab'd, or Pim∣pled
Faces, wear a Thousand Patches
to hide them, and those that have
none, scandalize their Faces by a Fool∣ish
imitation. Here they shew their
Courage by being unconcerned at a

Husband
 being 
Poison'd,
 a 
Hero
 being

Kill'd,
 or a Passionate Lover being
Jilted: And discover their Modesties
by standing Buff at a Baudy Song, or


a Naked Obscene Figure. By the
Signs that both Sexes hang out, you
may know their Qualities or Occu∣pations,
and not mistake in making
your Addresses.


Men of 
Figure
 and Consideration,
are known by seldom being there,
and Men of 
Wisdom
 and Business, by
being always absent. A 
Beau
 is
known by the Decent Management of
his Sword-Knot, and Snust-Box. A

Poet
 by his Empty Pockets: A Citi∣zen
by his Horns and Gold Hatband:
A Whore by a 
Vizor-Mask:
 And a
Fool by Talking to her. A Play-House

Wit
 is distinguish'd by wanting
Understanding; and a 
Iudge
 of Wit
by Nodding and Sleeping, till the fal∣ling
of the Curtain, and Crowding to
get out awake him.


I have told you already, that the
Play-House was the Land of Enchant∣ment,
the Country of Metamorpho∣sis,
and performed it with the greatest
speed imaginable. Here in the Twin∣kling
of an Eye, you shall see Men
transform'd into Demi-Gods: And
Goddesses made as true Flesh and
Blood, as our Common Women. Here

Fools
 by Slight of Hand, are conver∣ted


into 
Wits.
 Honest Women into
Errant Whores, and which is most mi∣raculous,
Cowards into Valiant 
Hero's,

and Rank 
Coquets
 and 
Iilts
 into as
Chaste and Vertuous 
Mistresses,
 as a
Man would desire to put his Knife
into.


Let us now speak a Word or so, of
the Natives of this Country, and the
Stock of 
Wit
 and 
Manners
 by which
they Maintain themselves, and Ridi∣cule
the whole World besides. The
People are all somewhat 
Whimsical,

and Giddy-Brain'd: When they Speak,
they Sing, when they Walk, they
Dance, and very often do both when
they have no mind to it.


The 
Stage
 has now so great a share of
Atheism, Impudence, and Prophane∣ness,
that it looks like an Assembly of

Demons,
 directing the Way 
Hellward;

and the more Blasphemous the Poets
are, the more are they admired, even
from Huffing 
Dryden,
 to Sing-Song

Durfey,
 who always Stutters at Sence,
and speaks plain when he Swears 
G
—
Dam
me.
 What are all their New Plays
but Damn'd Insipid Dull 
Farces,
 con∣founded
Toothless 
Satyr,
 or Plaguy

Rhiming
 Plays, with Scurvy Heroes,


worse than the Knight of the Sun, or

Amadis de Gaul.
 They are the er∣rantest

Plagiaries
 in Nature, and like
our Common News-Writers, Steal from
one another.


When any Humour Takes in 
Lon∣don,

they Ride it to Death before they
leave it. The Primitive 
Christians

were not Persecuted with half that
Variety, as the poor Unthinking

Beaux
 are tormented with upon the
Theatre.


Character
 they supply with a 
Smutty

Song, Humour with a 
Dance,
 and Ar∣gument
with 
Lightning
 and 
Thunder,

which has often reprieved many a
Scurvy Play from Damning.


A Huge great 
Muff,
 and a 
Gaudy

Ribbon hanging at a Bully's Back∣side,
is an Excellent Jest; and New
Invented Curses, as 
Stap my Vitals,
Damn my Diaphragma, Slit my Wind-Pipe;

Rig up a New Beau, tho' in
the Main 'tis but the same everlast∣ing
Coxcomb; and there's as much
difference between their Rhimes, and
Solid Verse, as between the Royal
Psalmist, and 
Hopkins
 and 
Sternhold,

with their Collars of 
Ay
's and 
Eeke
's
about them.



'Tis a hard Matter to find such
things as Reason, Sense, or Modesty,
among them; for the Mens Heads
are so full of Musick, that you can
have nothing from them but empty
Sounds; and the Women are so 
Light,

they may easily be blown up or down
like a Feather.








Amusement VI.




The WALKS.


WE have divers sorts of Walks
about 
London,
 in some you
go to see and be seen, in others nei∣ther
to see nor to be seen, but like a
Noun Substantive to be Felt, Heard,
and Understood.


The Ladies that have an Inclination
to be Private, take Delight in the
Close Walks of 
Spring-Gardens,
 where
both Sexes meet, and mutually serve
one another as Guides to lose their
Way, and the Windings and Turn∣ings
in the little Wildernesses, are so
intricate, that the most Experienc'd
Mothers, have often lost themselves
in looking for their Daughters.


From Spring-Garden we set our Fa∣ces
towards 
Hide-Park,
 where Horses
have their Diversion as well as Men,
and Neigh and Court their Mistresses


almost in as intelligible a Dialect.
Here People Coach it to take the Air,
amidst a Cloud of 
Dust,
 able to Choak
a Foot Soldier, and hinder'd us from
seeing those that come thither on pur∣pose
to shew themselves: However we
made hard shift to get now and then
a Glance at some of them.


Here we saw much to do about no∣thing;
a World of Brave Men, Gilt-Coaches,
and Rich Liveries. Within
some of them were Upstart Courtiers,
blown up as big as Pride and Vanity
could swell them to; sitting as Up∣right
in their Chariots, as if a Stake
had been driven through them. It
would hurt their Eyes to exchange a
Glance upon any thing that's Vulgar,
and that's the Reason they are so spa∣ring
of their Looks, that they will
neither Bow nor move their Hats to
any thing under a Duke or a Dutchess;
and yet if you examine some of their
Originals; a Covetous, Soul-less Mi∣ser,
or a great Oppressor, laid the
Foundation of their Families, and in
their Retinue there are more Credi∣tors
than Servants.


See, says my 
Indian,
 what a Bevy
of Gallant Ladies are in yonder Coa∣ches;
some are Singing, others Laugh∣ing,


others Tickling one another, and
all of them Toying and devouring
Cheefe-Cakes, March-Pane, and 
Chi∣na

Oranges. See that Lady says he,
was ever any thing so black as her
Eye, and so clear as her Forehead?
One would Swear her Face had taken
its Tincture from all the Beauties in
Nature; and yet perhaps, answered
I to my Fellow Traveller, all this is
but Imposture; she might, for ought
we know, go to Bed last Night as
ugly as a 
Hagg,
 tho' she now appears
like an Angel: and if you did but see
this Puppet taken to pieces, her whole
is but Paint and Plaster. From hence
we went to take a Turn in the

Mall.


When we came into these Pleasant
Walks, my Fellow Traveller was Ra∣vish'd
at the most agreeable Sight in
Nature. There were none but Wo∣men
there that Day as it happened,
and the Walks were covered with
them.


I never, said he to me Laughing,
beheld in my Life so great a Flight of
Birds. Bless me, how Fine and Pret∣ty
they are.



Friend, reply'd I to him in the same
Metaphor, these are Birds to Amuse
one, that change their Feathers two or
three times a Day.


They are Fickle and Light by Incli∣nation,
Weak by Constitution, but
never weary of Billing and Chirp∣ing.


They never see the Day till the
Sun is just going to Set, they Hop
always upright with one Foot upon
the Ground, and touch the Clouds
with their proud Toppings. In a
word, the generality of Women are
Peacocks when they Walk; Water-Wagtails
when they are within Doors,
and Turtles when they meet Face to
Face.


This is a bold Description of them,
says my 
Indian.
 Pray tell me, Sir,
says he, is this Portrait of them after
Nature? Yes, without Question, an∣swer'd
I, but I know some Women that
are Superior to the rest of their Sex,
and perhaps to Men also. In relation
to those, I need not say much to di∣stinguish
them from the rest, for they'll
soon distinguish themselves by their
Vertuous Discourse and Deport∣ment.



Nothing is so hard to be Defined
as Women, and of all Women in the
World none are so undefinable as those
of 
London.


The 
Spanish
 Women are altogether

Spanish,
 the 
Italians
 altogether 
Itali∣ans,

the 
Germans
 altogether 
Germans,

the 
French
 Women always like them∣selves;
but among the 
London Women

we find 
Spaniards, Italians, Germans,

and 
French,
 blended together into one
individual Monopoly of all Humours
and Fashions.


Nay, how many different Nations
are there of our 
English
 Ladies. In
the first place there is the 
Politick
 Na∣tion
of your Ladies of the Town.
Next the 
Savage
 Nation of Country
Dames. Then the 
Free
 Nation of the
Coquets. The 
Invisible
 Nation of the
Faithful Wives, (the worst Peopled of
all.) The 
Good-Natur'd
 Nation of
Wives that Cuckold their Husbands,
(they are almost forced to Walk upon
one anothers Heads, their Numbers
are so prodigious.) The 
Warlike
 Na∣tion
of Intriguing Ladies. The 
Fear∣ful

Nation of—, but there are
scarce any of them left. The 
Barba∣rous

Nation of Mothers-in-Law. The

Haughty
 Nation of Citizens Wives,


that are Dignified with a Title. The

Strowling
 Nation of your regular Vi∣sitants,
and the Lord knows how ma∣ny
more: Not to reckon the 
Supersti∣tious

Nation that run after Conjurers
and Fortune-Tellers. 'Tis pitty this
latter sort are not lock'd up in a Quar∣ter
by themselves, and that the Nati∣on
of 
Cunning
 Women are not rooted
out that abuse them, and set them up∣on
doing some things, which other∣wise
they would not.


I have suffer'd my self to be carried
too far by my Subject. 'Tis a strange
thing that we cannot talk of Women
with a Just Moderation: We ei∣ther
talk too much, or too little of
them: We don't speak enough of

Vertuous
 Women, and we speak too
much of those that are not so.


Men would do Justice to 'em all, if
they could talk of them without Pas∣sion;
but they scarce speak at all of
those that are Indifferent: They are
prepossessed for them they Love, and
against them by whom they cannot
make themselves to be Beloved.


They rank the latter in the Class
of 
Irregular
 Women, because they are
Wise, and indeed Wiser than they
would have them be. The Railing of


the Men ought to be the Justification
of the Women; but it unluckily falls
out, that one half of the World take
delight to raise Scandalous Stories,
and t'other half in believing them.


Slander has been the Product of all
Times, and all Countries; it is very
near of as Ancient standing in the
World, as Vertue. Defamation ought
to be more severely punish'd than
Theft. It does more Injury to Civil
Societies, and 'tis a harder matter to
secure one's Reputation from a Slan∣derer,
than one's Money from a Rob∣ber.


All the World are agreed, that both
one and the other are Scoundrels, yet
for all that we esteem 'em when they
excel in this Art. A Nice and a Witty
Railer is the most agreeable Person in
Conversation; and he that Dexterous∣ly
picks another Man's Pocket, as
your Quacks and Attornies, draws
the Veneration even of those who
live by Cutting of Purses.


When one observes in what Reputa∣tion
both of them live, one would be
apt to say, That'tis neither Defamati∣on,
nor Robbery, that we blame in
others; but only their 
Awkardness
 and
want of Skill. They are punish'd for


not being able to arrive at the Perfecti∣on
of their Art.


Come, come, says my 
Indian,
 you
ramble from your Subject; you speak
of Back-Biting in General, whereas at
present we are only talking of that
Branch of it which belongs to Women.
I would bring you back to that Point,
which puts me in mind of certain
Laws, which was heretofore proposed
by a Legislator of my Country. One
of these Laws gave permission for one
Woman to Slander another; in the
first place, because it is 
impossible to
prevent it;
 and besides, because in
Matters of Gallantry, she that accu∣ses
her Neighbour, might her self
be accused of it in her turn, pursu∣ant
to the Ancient and Righteous
Law of returning a 
Rowland
 for an

Oliver.


But how would you have a Woman
quit Scores with a Man, who has
publish'd disadvantageous Stories of
her? Must she serve him in the same
kind? By all means: For if Men
think it a piece of Merit to Conquer
Women, and Women place theirs in
well defending themselves, she that
gets a Lover sings a Triumph; and


she that Loves, confesses her felf to
be Conquered.


If it were true, that the Ladies
were more Weak than we are, their
Fall would be more excusable; but I
think we are Weaker than our Wives,
since we expect they should pardon us
in every thing, and we will pardon
nothing in them. One would think
that when a Man had got a Woman in∣to
a Matrimonial Noose, 'twas enough
for her to be wholly his: And by the
same Reason should not the Man be
wholly hers? What a Tyranny is this
in the Men, to monopolize Infidelity
to themselves?


But if Men will be slandering Wo∣men,
let them vent their Fury against
those only that are ugly, for that is
neither Slandering nor Calumniating,
tho'it be a Crime the Ladies will ne∣ver
forgive; for the Generality of
them are more Jealous of the Reputa∣tion
of their Beaties, than of their
Honours, and she that wants a whole
Morning at least to bring her Face to
perfection, would be more con∣cern'd
to be surpriz'd at her 
Toilet,

than to be taken in the Arms of a
Gallant.



I am not at all surprized at this No∣tion,
for the chief Vertue in the La∣dies
Catechism is to please; and Beau∣ty
pleases Men more effectually than
Wisdom. One Man loves Sweetness
and Modesty in a Woman; another
loves a Jolly Damsel with Life and
Vigour; but Agreeableness and Beau∣ty
Relishes with all Humane Pal∣lats.


A Young Woman who has no other
Portion than her hopes of Pleasing, is
at a loss what Measures to take that
she may make her Fortune. Is she
Simple, we despise her: Is she Vertu∣ous
we don't like her Company. Is
she a Coquet, we avoid her: There∣fore
to succeed well in the World, 'tis
necessary that she be Vertuous, Sim∣ple,
and a Coquet all at once. Sim∣plicity
Invites us, Coquetry Amuses,
and Vertue Retains us.


'Tis a hard matter for a Woman to
escape the Censures of the Men. 'Tis
much more so to guard themselves
from the Womens Tongues. A La∣dy
that sets up for Vertue, makes
her self envied; she that pretends
to Gallantry, makes her self despi∣sed;
but she that pretends to no∣thing,
escapes Contempt and Envy,


and saves her self between two Re∣putations.


This Management surpasses the Ca∣pacity
of a Young Woman: Those
that are Young and Handsome, are
exposed to two Temptations: To pre∣serve
themselves from them they want
the Assistance of Reason; and 'tis
their Misfortune that Reason comes
not in to their Relief, till their Youth
and Beauty, and the Danger is gone
together. Tell us why should not
Reason come as soon as Beauty, since
one was made to defend the other?


It does not depend upon a Woman
to be Handsome; the only Beauty
that all of them might have, and some
of them, to speak Modestly, think
fit to part with, is 
Chastity;
 but of all
Beauties whatsoever, 'tis the easiest
to lose.


She that never was yet in Love, is
so asham'd of her first Weakness, that
she would by all means conceal it from
her self: As for the second, she desires
to conceal it from others; but she does
not think it worth the while to conceal
the third from any Body.


When 
Chastity
 is once gone, 'tis no
more to be retriev'd than Youth.



Those that have lost their Chastities,
assumes an affected one, which is
much sooner provoked than that which
is real: Of which we had an Experi∣ment
in the Close Walk at the Head
of 
Rosamond
's 
Pond,
 where for one
poor Equivocal World, a Brisk She
was ready to tear a Gentleman's Cra∣vat
off; who after a further Parley,
discover'd her self to be sensible of
some things which she ought to have
been ignorant of, to have maintained
her affected Modesty.


A Lady of this Character was sit∣ting
on the side of this 
Pond
 upon the

Grass
 with her Younger Sister newly
come out of the Country, to whom a
Spark sitting by, entertain'd her with
a Relation of an Amorous Adventure
between my Lord—, and my La∣dy

Love it;
 but expressing himself in
such Obscene Ambiguous Terms, that
a Woman that did not know 
What
 was

What,
 could as soon fly with a Hun∣dred
Weight of Lead at her Heels, as
tell what to make of it: The more
obscurely the Gentleman told his Sto∣ry,
the more attentively did our
Young Creature listen to it, and dis∣cover'd
her Curiosity by some simple
harmless Questions. The Elder of


the two Sisters desirous to let the
Gentleman, and others that sate by
them, understand that she had more
Modesty than her Younger Sister,
cryed out, Oh fie, Sister, fie; Can
you hear such a wicked Story as this
without Blushing?


Alas, Sister, says the Young Inno∣cency,
I don't yet know what it is to
Blush, or what it is you mean by
it!


The Gentleman soon took the
Hint, and whispering the Elder Sister
in the Ear, she immediately sends
Home the Young Ignorant Creature
by her Footman, and Trig'd away
Hand in Hand with the Gentleman.
Her cunning Management, shew'd her
an Experienc'd 
Coquet,
 who observ'd a
sort of 
Decorum,
 to Usher in a greater
Liberty.


Every thing is managed in good
Order, by a Woman that knows her
Company, and understands her Busi∣ness.
He that loses his Money out of
Complaisance, yields place to him
who lends the Lady his Coach to take
the Air in. The Young 
Heir
 begins
where the Ruin'd 
Cully
 ended. He
that pays for the Collation, is suc∣ceeded
by another that Eats it; and


when my 
Lord
 comes in at the Gate,
poor Sir 
Iohn
 must Scamper out at the
Window.


The Green Walk afforded us varie∣ty
of Discourses from Persons of both
Sexes. Here walk'd a Beau 
Bare∣headed

by a Company of the Com∣mon
Profession in Dishabilie, and
Night-Dresses; either for want of Day
Cloths, or to shew they were ready
for Business.


Here walk'd a 
French
 Fop with both
his Hands in his Pockets, carrying all
his Pleated Coat before, to shew his
Silk Breeches.


There were a Cluster of Senators
talking of State Affairs, and the Price
of Corn, and Cattle, and were di∣sturb'd
with the Noisy 
Milk Folks,

crying, 
A Can of Milk, Ladies; a
Can of Red Cows Milk, Sir.


Here were a Beavy of Bucksom
Lasses complaining of the Decay of
Trade, and Monopilies; and there
Vertuous Women, Railing against
Whores, their Husbands, and Coquet∣try.


And now being weary of Walking
so long, we reposed our selves upon
one of the Benches, and digesting se∣veral
Dialogues between the Modest


Ladies and Coquets, made this Ob∣servation.


That tho' the 
Coquets
 were despised
by the generality of 
Ladies,
 yet they
immitate them to a Hairs Breadth in
their whole Conduct. They learn of
them the 
Winning
 Air, the 
Bewitching

Glance, the 
Amorous
 Smirk, and the

Sullen
 Pout. They 
Talk,
 and 
Dress,

and 
Patch
 like them: They must
needs go down with the Stream. It
is the Coquets that Invent the New
Modes and Expressions; every thing
is done for them, and by them; tho'
with all these Advantages, there is a
vast difference between the one and
the other. The Reputation of Ver∣tuous
Women is more solid; that of
Coquets is more extended. But


I am sensible I have made too long
a stay in this part of my Voyage. A
Man always Amuses himself longer
with the 
Women,
 than he is willing.
Well, since we are here, let's shew
our 
Indian
 the Horse-Guards, the
Country of Gallantry.


In our Way thither, was nothing
worth our Observation, unless 'twas
the Bird-Cage, inhabited by Wild-Fowl;
the Ducks begging Charity,
the Black-Guard Boys robbing their


own Bellies to relieve them, and an

English Dog-Kennel
 Translated into a

French Eating-House.






GALLANTRY.


LET'S enter into this Brave Coun∣try,
and see—: But what is
there to be seen here? Gallantry and
Bravery which was formerly so well
Cultivated, so Flourishing and Fre∣quented
by many Persons of Honour,
is at present Desolate, Unmanur'd,
and Abandoned! What a Desert 'tis
become! Alass, I can see nothing in
it but a Disbanned Soldier mounted
upon a Pedestal, standing Centinel o∣ver
the Ducks and Wild-Geese, and
to prevent an Invasion by O—'s

Spanish Pilgrims,
 or 
Webster
's 
Darci∣nus.


Why, says my 
Indian,
 is that a
Soldier? He has ne'er a Sword, and
is Naked.


I suppose, reply'd I to the 
Indian,

since the Peace he has Pawn'd his
Sword to buy him Food; and for his


being Naked, who regards it? What
signifies a 
Soldier
 in Time of 
Peace?

Pish, a Soldier Naked, is that such a
Wonder? What are they good for
else but Hanging, or Starving, when
we have no occasion for them; as has
been learnedly determined by the
Author of that Original Amuse∣ment,

Arguments against a Standing
Army.


Our God, and Soldier, we alike A∣dore,


Iust at the Brink of Danger, not be∣fore;


After Deliverance, they are alike re∣quited,


Our God's Forgotten, and our Soldi∣er's
Slighted.


Come, this is a Melancholy Coun∣try,
let's leave Amusing our selves
about Gallantry and Bravery, and
all at once, like Men that have no∣thing
to Do, nor nothing to Have,
take a Trip into the Land of Marri∣age,
and see Who and Who are toge∣ther:
But first, What are those Sol∣diers
doing? They look like Brave
Fellows.



They are, (says I) drawn up to
Prayers; and would be brave Men
indeed, if they were half as good at
Praying, and Fighting, as they are at
Cursing and Swearing.










Amusement VII.


MARRIAGE.


TIS a difficult Task to speak so
of Marriage, as to please all
People. Those who are not Noos'd
in the Snare, will thank me for gi∣ving
a Comical Description of it. The
Grand Pox eat this Buffoon, says the
Serious Wary Husband; if he was in
my Place, he wou'd have no more
Temptation to 
Laugh,
 than to Break
his Neck. If I Moralize gravely up∣on
the Inconveniences of Matrimony,
those that have a Longing to enter in∣to
that Honourable State, will com∣plain
that I disswade them from so
Charming a Condition. How then
shall I order my Discourse? For I am
in a great Perplexity about it.


A certain Painter made a Picture of

Hymen
 for a young Lover. I wou'd
have him drawn, says this Passionate


Gentleman, with all the Graces your
utmost Skill can bestow upon him:
Above all, remember that 
Hymen

ought to be more Beautiful than 
Ado∣nis:

You must put into his Hands a
Flambeau more Brillant than that of

Love.
 In short, give him all the
Charms that your Imagination and
Colours can bestow. I will pay you
for your Picture, according as I find
you use my Friend 
Hymen.
 The
Painter who was well acquainted with
his Generous Temper, was not want∣ing,
you may be sure, to answer his
Expectations, and brought him Home
the Piece the Evening before he was
Married. Our young Lover was not
at all satisfied with it. This Figure,
says he, wants a certain 
Gay Air,
 it
has none of those 
Charms
 and 
Agree∣ments.

As you have Painted him, he
makes but a very indifferent Appear∣ance,
and therefore you shall but be
indifferently paid.


The Painter who had as much Pre∣sence
of Mind, as Skill in his Profes∣sion,
took a Resolution what to do
that very Moment. You are in the
right on't, Sir, said he, to find fault
with my Picture, it is not yet dry:
This Face is 
Soak'd,
 and to deal freely


with you, the Colours I use in Paint∣ing,
don't appear worth a Farthing at
first. I will bring you this 
Table

some Months hence, and then you
shall pay me, as you find it pleases
you: I am confident it will appear
quite another thing then. 
Sir, your
Humble Servant, I have no occasion for
Money.


The Painter carried his Piece Home;
our young Lover was 
Married
 the
next Day, and some Months went o∣ver
his Head before the Painter ap∣pear'd.
At last he brings the Picture
with him, and our young Husband
was surpriz'd when he saw it. You
promis'd, says he, that time wou'd
mend your Picture, and you are as
good as your Word. Lord, what a
difference there is? I swear I scarce
know it now I see it again. I admire
to see what a strange effect a few
Months have had upon your Colours;
but I admire your Ingenuity much
more. However, Sir, I must take
the freedom to tell you, That in my
Opinion his Looks are somewhat of
the 
Gayest,
 these 
Eyes
 are too Brisk
and Lively: Then to deal plainly
with you, the 
Fires
 of 
Hymen
 ought
not to be altogether so bright as those


of 
Love;
 for his is a Solid but Hea∣vy
Fire. Besides, the Disposition of
your Figure, is somewhat to 
Free,
 and

Chearful,
 and you have given him a
certain Air of Wantonness, which let
me tell you, Sir, does not at all sit
well upon. .… In short, this is
none of 
Hymen.


Very well, Sir, said the Painter;
what I foresaw is now come to pass.

Hymen
 at present is not so beautiful in
your Idea, as in my Picture. The
Case is mightily alter'd from what it
was three Months ago. 'Tis not my
Picture, but your Imagination that is
changed: You were a Lover then, but
now a Husband.


I understand you very well, says
the Husband interrupting him, 
Let us
drop that Matter.
 Your Picture now
pleases, and here is more Money for
it than you could reasonably have ex∣pected.
By no means says the Pain∣ter,
you must excuse me there; but I
will give you another Picture, where∣in
by certain 
Optick Rules
 and Perspe∣ctives,
it shall be so contrived, as it
shall please both the 
Lovers
 and the

Husbands,
 and perform'd it according∣ly,
placing it at the end of a Long-Gallery,
upon a kind of an Alcove;


and to come to this Alcove, one must
first pass over a very Slippery Step.
On this side of it was the Critical
Place where the Piece look'd so Love∣ly
and Delicious; but as soon as you
were gone beyond it, it made a most
lamentable Figure.


If you understand how difficult a
thing it is to paint 
Matrimony
 to the
Gust of all People, pray suspend your
Censure here, I am going to Present
my Picture, chuse what Light you
please to view it in.


To come back to my Travelling
Stile, I must tell you at first Dash that

Marriage
 is a Country that Peoples all
others: The 
Commonalty
 are more
fruitful there than the 
Nobility,
 the
reason of which perhaps is, That the
Nobility take more delight to Ram∣ble
Abroad, than stay at Home. Mar∣riage
has this peculiar Property an∣next
to it, that it can alter the Hu∣mours
of those that are setled in it.
It frequently transforms a Jolly Fel∣low
into a Meer 
Sot,
 it often melts
down a 
Beau
 into an errant 
Sloven;

and on the other Hand it so happens
sometimes, that a 
Witty
 Vertuous
Woman will improve a 
Dull
 Heavy


Country 
Booby,
 into a Man of Sence
and Gallantry.


People Marry for different Mo∣tives:
Some are lead by Portion, and
others by Reason; the former with∣out
knowing what they are going to
do, and the latter knowing no more,
but that the thing must be done.


There are Men in the World so
weary of Quiet and Indolence, that
they Marry only to divert themselves.
In the first place the 
Choice
 of a Wo∣man
employs them for some time:
Then Visits and Interviews, Feasts
and Ceremonies; but after the last
Ceremony is over, they are more Ti∣red
and Weary than ever.


How many Hundred Married Cou∣ples
do we see, who from the second
Year of their coming together, have
nothing more in Common than their
Names, their Quality, their Ill Hu∣mour
and their Misery.


I don't wonder there are so many
Unhappy Matches, since Folks Masry
rather wholly of their own Heads, or
wholly by those of others. A Man
that Marries of his own Head, not
seeing that in his 
Spouse,
 which all the
World sees in her, is in danger of see∣ing


much more in her, than others e∣ver
did.


Another that has not Courage e∣nough
to trust his own Judgment,
fairly applies himself to the next

Match-Maker
 in the Neighbourhood,
who knows to a Tittle the exact Rates
of the Market, and the Current Price
of Young Women that are fit to Mar∣ry.
These Marriage 
Hucksters,
 or

Wife-Brokers,
 have an admirable Ta∣lent
to sort Conditions, Families,
Trades, and Estates: In short, every
thing together, except Humours and
Inclinations, about which they never
trouble themselves.


By the Procurement of these expe∣rienc'd
Matrons, a Marriage is struck
up like a 
Smithfield
 Bargain: There is
much Higling and Wrangling for t' o∣ther
Ten Pound. One side endeavours
to raise, and the other to beat down
the Market Price. At last, after a
World of Words spent to fine purpose,
they come to a Conclusion.


Others that have not time to Truck
and Bargain so, go immediately to a
Scrivener's to find out a 
Rich Widow,

as they go to the Office of Intelli∣gence
to hearken out a Service.



It is not altogether the Match-ma∣kers
Fault, if you are deceived in
your Woman. She gives you an ac∣count
of her 
Portion
 to a Farthing▪
You examine nothing but the Arti∣cles
relating to the 
Family
 and the 
For∣tune;

the Woman is left in the Mar∣gin
of the Inventory, and you find
her too much at long run.


After all that I have said, I am not
afraid to advance this Proposition; that

'tis possible for those that Marry to be
Happy.
 But you must call it Truck∣ing
or Bartering, and not Marrying, to
take a Woman meerly for her Fortune,
and reckon her Perfections by the
Number of 
Pounds
 she is like to bring
with her. Not is it to Marry but to
Please one's self, to choose a Wife as
we do a 
Tulip,
 meerly for her Beau∣ty.
It is not to Marry, but to 
Doat

at a certain Age, to take a 
Young
Woman
 only for the sake of her Com∣pany.


What is it then to be Marry'd?
Why, 'tis to choose with Circumspe∣ction,
and Deliberation, by Inclinati∣on,
and not by Interest, such a Wo∣man
as will chuse you after the same
manner.



Besides other things in common
with all the World, the Country of

Marriage
 has this Particular to it self;
That Strangers have a desire to Settle
there, and the Natural Inhabitants
wou'd be Banish'd out of it with all
their Hearts.


A Man may be Banish'd out of this
Country by certain things call'd 
Sepa∣ration;

but the true way of getting
out of it is by Widdow-hood, and is
much to be preferred before Separati∣on;
for the Separated are 
Savage
 Ani∣mals,
uncapable of the prettiest Ties
of Society. The usual Causes of Se∣paration
is assign'd as the Fault of the
Wife, but often the Husband is the
occasion that the Wife is in the
Fault; and he himself is a Fool to pro∣claim
to the World that his Wife has
made a false Step.


It will be expected now, that I speak
a few Words of Widdowhood. 'Tis
a Copious and Fertile Subject that's
certain; but a Man may burn his Fin∣gers
by medling with it. For if I de∣scribe
them but as little concern'd for
the Death of their Husbands, I shall
offend the Rules of Decency and good
Manners, and if I exaggerate their
Afflictions, I shall offend the Truth.



Whatever our Railers pretend to
the contrary, I say there's no Wid∣dowhood
without a sprinkling of Sor∣row
in it. Is it not a very Sorrowful
Condition to be obliged to Counter∣feit
a perpetual Sorrow? A very
Doleful Part this, that a Widdow
must plhy, who would not give the
World occasion to Talk of her.


There are some Widdows in the
World so mightily befriended by Pro∣vidence,
that their Sighs and Tears
cost them nothing I know one of a
contrary Temper to this, who did ho∣nestly
all that in her lay to afflict her
self; but Nature it seems had denied
her the Gift of Tears. She desir'd
to raise the Compassion of her Hus∣band's
Relations, for her All depend∣ed
on them.


One Day her Brother-in-Law, who
lamented exceedingly, reproach'd her
for not having shed one Tear. Alass,
reply'd the Widow to him, my Poor
Heart is so over-whelm'd with this
unexpected Calamity, that I am, as
it were become insensible by it. Great
Sotrows are not felt at first; but I
am sure mine will Kill me in the
End.



I know very well, said her Brother-in-Law
to her, that Griefs too great
don't make themselves at first to be
perceived; and I know as well, that
Violent Griefs don't continue long.
Thus, Madam, you will be strangely
surprized, that the Grief of your
Widdowhood will be past before you
are aware.


Another Widow was reduced to the
last pitch of Despair, nor was it without
a very Sorrowful Occasion. She had
lost upon the same Day the 
Best Hus∣band,

and the prettiest little 
Lap-Dog

in 
London.
 This double Widdowhood
had brought her to so low a Conditi∣on,
that her Friends were afraid of her
Life. They durst not speak to her of
Eating and Drinking; nay, they durst
not so much as offer to Comfort her.
'Tis a dangerous Matter, you know,
to combat a Woman's Grief. The
best way is to let Time and their Natu∣ral
Inconstancy work it off. Howe∣ver
to accustom our Widdow by little
and little to support the Idea of her
Two Losses, a Good Friend spoke to
her first of her 
Little Dog.
 At the
bare Name of 
Dony,
 there was such a
Howling and Crying, such Tearing of
Hair, and Beating of Breasts; in


short, such a Noise, and such a Pother,
that one would have thought Heaven
and Earth had been coming together▪
At last she fainted away. Well, says
this Prudent Friend of hers, God be
prais'd I was so happy as not to men∣tion
her 
Husband
 to her, for then
she had certainly Died upon the
Spot.


The next Day the Name of 
Dony

set her Tears a running in so great
plenty, that it was hoped the Spring
would stop of it self, and the above-mentioned
Zealous Friend, thought
she might now venture to administer
some Consolation to her.


Alass, says she, if the bare Name
of 
Dony
 gives you so much Affliction,
what might we not fear from you,
should we talk to you of your 
Dear
Husband?
 But God forbid I should do
that. 
Ah Poor Dony!
 To be Mow'd
down thus in the Flower of Youth
and Beauty! Well, 
Madam,
 you'll
never have such another pretty Crea∣ture
again. But 'tis happy for the

Dog
 that he's Dead, for you cou'd ne∣ver
have Lov'd him longer that's cer∣tain!
Is it possible for a Woman to
love any thing after she has lost her
Husband?



After this manner it was that this

Discreet
 Gentlewoman very dexterous∣ly
mingled the Idea of the 
Husband

with that of 
Dony,
 well knowing that
as two Shoulders of Mutton drive
down one another, so two powerful
Griefs destroy one another by making
a Diversion. She observed that at the
Name of 
Dony,
 her Tears redoubled,
which stopt short at the Name of 
Hus∣band:

It was without question, a sort
of a 
Qualm.
 Every Body knows that
Tears are a Tribute we owe, and on∣ly
pay to ordinary Griefs. However
it was, our poor Afflicted Widow pas∣sed
several Days and Nights in this
sad Alternative of Weeping for her

Dog,
 and Lamenting her 
Husband.


At last her Good Friend enquired
all over the Town for a 
Pretty Dog;

and it was her good Luck to light up∣on
one much Finer and Prettier than

Dony of Happy Memory,
 and presented
it to our Widdow, who burst into a
fresh Stream of Tears as she accepted
it. This Beautiful New-comer, so
strangely insinuated himself into her
Good Affections, that within Eight
Days he had got the Ascendant of her
Heart, and 
Dony
 was no more thought
of, then if he had never had a Being


there. Observe now what a Conse∣quence
our Widows Friend drew from
it.


If a New 
Dog
 has put a stop to her

Tears,
 perhaps a New 
Husband
 will
have the same Operation upon her

Qualms.
 But Alass, the one was not
to be so easily effected as the other.
The New 
Dog
 so play'd his Cards,
that he effaced the Memory of his
Predecessors in Eight Days; but it
was above 
Three
 Long Tedious
Months, before our Widow could be
brought to take a New 
Husband
 into
her Bed.


Now tho' I left my self full power
to drop my 
Indian
 Traveller as often
as I saw convenient, yet I have no in∣tention
to lose him out of my Sight;
for I have occasion for him to autho∣rize
certain Odd Fances that come into
my Head, concerning 
Philosophy
 and

Physick,
 which are the next Countries
I design to visit.








Amusement VIII.


The Philosophical, or Vir∣tuosi
Country.


IN this Country every thing is ob∣scure,
their Habitations, their
Looks, their Language, and their
Learining. 'Tis a long time ago since
they undertook to cultivate the Coun∣try
of 
Science;
 but the only Thing
they have made clear and undeniable,
is, that One and One makes Two:
And the Reason why this is so 
clear,
 is
because it was known by all Men be∣fore
they made a 
Science
 of it.


Their 
Geometricians
 work upon so
solid a Foundation, that as soon as e∣ver
they have well laid the first Stone,
they carry on their Buildings without
the least fear, so high as the 
Atmo∣sphere;

but their 
Philosophers
 build
those haughty Edifices they call Sy∣stems,
upon a quite different Bottom.



They lay their Foundation in the
Air, and when they think they are
come to solid Ground, the Building
disappears, and the Architects tum∣ble
down from the Clouds.


This Country of 
Experimental Phi∣losophy,

is very Amusing, and their
Collections of 
Rarities
 exceeds that
of 
Iohn Tradusken,
 for here are the
Galls of Doves, the Eye-Teeth of
Flying Toads, the Eggs of Ants, and
the Eyes of Oysters. Here they weigh
the 
Air,
 measure 
Heat, Cold, Dryness,

and 
Humidity,
 great Discoveries for
the publick advantage of Mankind.
Without giving our selves the trouble
to make use of our Senses, we need
but only cast our Eyes upon a Wea∣ther-Glass,
to know if 'tis Hot or
Cold, if it Rains, or is Fair Wea∣ther.


Tempted by these Noble Curiosi∣ties,
I desired the favour of seeing
some of the Gentlemen they called
Improvers of Nature, and immediate∣ly
they shewed me an Old Bard cut∣ting
Asp Leaves into Tongues, which
were to be fastened in the Mouths of
Flowers, Fruits, Herbs, and Seeds,
with design to make the whole Crea∣tion
Vocal. Another was Dissecting


Atomes, and Mites in Cheese, for the
improvement of the Anatomical Sci∣ence,
and a third was transfusing the
Blood of an 
Ass
 into an 
Astrological
Quack;
 of a 
Sheep
 into a 
Bully;
 and
of a 
Fish
 into an 
Exchange-Woman,

which had all the desired Effects; the

Quack
 prov'd a 
Sot,
 the 
Bully
 a 
Cow∣ard,

and the 
Tongue-Pad
 was 
Silent.

All Prodigies in Nature, and none
miscarried in the Operation.


In another Apartment were a curi∣ous
Collection of 
Contemplative
 Gen∣tlemen,
that had their Employments
severally assign'd them. One was
Chewing the Cud upon Dr. 
Burnet
's

New System of the World,
 and making
Notes upon it in Consutation of 
Moses

and all the Antidiluvian 
Historians.

Another was Reconciling the Diffe∣rences
among 
Learned Men,
 as between

Aristotle
 and 
Des Cartes, Cardan
 and

Copernicus, William Penn
 and 
Christia∣nity,

Mr. 
Edwards
 and 
Arabick:
 De∣termining
the Controversy between
the 
Acidists
 and 
Alkalists,
 and putting
a Period to the Abstruse Debates be∣tween
the 
Engineers
 and 
Mouse-Trap
Makers.



If any one ask me, which of these
Disputants has Reason of his side, I
will say that some of them have the

Reason of Antiquity,
 the other 
the Rea∣son
of Novelty;
 and in Matters of O∣pinion,
these two Reasons have a
greater influence upon the Learned,
than Reason it self.


Those that set up for finding the
North-West Passage into the Land of

Philosophy,
 would with all their Hearts,
if it were possible, follow these two
Guides all at once, but they are afraid
to travel in a Road where they talk of
nothing but 
Accidents
 and 
Privation,
Hecceities
 and 
Entelechias.
 Then they
find themselves all on the sudden sei∣zed
with Hot and Cold, Dry and
Moist, penetrated by a subtile Mat∣ter,
encompassed with 
Vortexes,
 and
so daunted by the fear of a 
Vacuum,

that it drives them back, instead of
encouraging them to go forward.


A Man need not lay it much to
Heart that he never Travel'd through
this Country; for those that have
not so much as beheld it at a distance,
know as much of it almost, as these
that have spent a great deal of Mo∣ney
and Time there; but one of their
Arts I admire above all the rest, and


that is, when they have Consumed
their Estates in trifling Experiments, to
perswade themselves they are now
as Rich, and Eat and Drink as Luxu∣riously
as ever; they view a single
Shilling in a Multiplying Glass, which
makes it appear a Thousand, and
view their Commons in a Magnifying
Glass, which makes a Lark look as
big as a Turkey-Cock, and a Three-penny
Chop as large as a Chine of
Mutton.


Before I let my Traveller pass from
this place to 
Physick,
 'twill not be a∣miss
to make him remark, That in the
Country of 
Science
 and the 
Court,
 we
lose our selves; that we don't search
for our selves in 
Marriage;
 that in the

Walks
 and among 
Women
 we find our
selves again; but seldom or never
come back from the Kingdom of 
Phy∣sick.








Amusement IX.


PHYSICK.


THE first thing remarkable in the
Country of 
Physick,
 is, that it
is situate upon the 
Narrow
 Passage
from this World to the other. 'Tis a
Clymaterick Country, where they
make us Breath a Refreshing Air, but
such a one as is a great Enemy to the
Natural Heat, and those that Travel
far in this 
Climate,
 throw away a
World of Money in Drugs, and at
last Die of Hunger.


The Language that is spoken here,
is very Learned; but the People that
speak it are very Ignorant.


In other Countries we learn Lan∣guages
to be able to express what we
know in clear and intelligible Terms;
but it looks as if 
Physicians
 learnt their
Gibberish for no other purpose, than


to embroil what they do not under∣stand.


How I pitty a Patient of good
Sence that falls into their Hands? He
is obliged at once to Combat the Ar∣guments
of the Doctor, the Disease it
self, the Remedies, and Emptiness.
One of my Friends, whom all this to∣gether
had thrown into a 
Dilyrium,
 had
a Vision in his Fever which sav'd him
his Life. He fancied he saw a Feaver
under the Shape of a Burning Mon∣ster,
that press'd hard upon a Sick
Man, and every Minute got Ground
of him, till a Man who look'd like a

Guide,
 came and took him by the 
Wrist

to help him over a River of Blood.
The poor Patient had not Strength e∣nough
to cross the Stream and so was
Drown'd. The 
Guide
 used means to
get himself paid for his Pains, and
immediately run after another Sick
Man, who was carried down a Stream
of 
Carduus
 Posset-Drink, Barly-Broth,
and Water-Gruel. My Friend advi∣sed
by this Vision, discarded his 
Do∣ctor,

and 'twas this that did his Busi∣ness;
for when he was by himself,
there was no Body to hinder him from
recovering. The Absence of Physi∣cians,
is a Soveraign Remedy to


him that has not Recourse to a
Quack.


These Gentlemen of the 
Faculty,

are Pensioners to 
Death,
 and Travel
Day and Night to enlarge that Mo∣narch's
Empire; for you must know,
notwithstanding Distemper'd Humours
make a Man Sick, 'tis the 
Physician

that has the Honour of Killing him,
and expects to be well paid for the
Job, by his Relations that lay in wait
for his Life to share his Fortune: So
that when a Man is ask'd how such a
one Died, he is not presently to an∣swer
according to Corrupt Custome,
that he Died of a Feaver or Pleurisy;
but that he Died of the 
Doctor.


See a Consult of them marching in
State to a Patient, attended by a Di∣minitive

Apothecary,
 that's just Arse
high, and fit to give a Clyster. How
Majesterially they look, and talk of
the Patient's Recovery, when they
themselves are but 
Death
 in a Disguise,
and bring the Patient's 
Hour
 along
with them. While the Patient breaths
and Money comes, they are still Pre∣scribing;
but when they have sent
the Patient hence, like a 
Rat
 with a
Straw in's Arse; they'll say his Body
was as Rotten as a Pear, and 'twas im∣possible


to Save him. 
Cruel
 People,
that are not contented to take away a
Man's Life, and like the 
Hangman,

be Paid when they have done; but
must Persecute him in the Grave too;
and Blast his Honour, to excuse their
Ignorance.


It were to be wish'd that every
Physician might be obliged to Mar∣ry;
for its highly reasonable, that
those Men should beget Children to
the State, who every Day rob the
King of so many of his Subjects.


In this Land of 
Physick
 they have
erected themselves a 
College,
 for the
Improvement of the Mystery of

Man-Slaughter;
 which may be call'd
their 
Armory;
 for here are their Wea∣pons
and Utensils forged, and a Com∣pany
of Men attending to Kill Poor
Folks out of meer Charity.


In one part of their Convent, is a

Chymical Elabaratory,
 where some
were Calcining Calves-Brains, to sup∣ply
those of the 
Society
 that wanted.
Some fixing Volatile Wits, and others
Rarifying Dull ones. Some were
playing Tricks with 
Mercury,
 promi∣sing
themselves vast Advantages from
the Process; but after they had Re∣solv'd
the 
Viscous
 Matter, and brought


the 
Materia Prima
 into the 
Coppel,
 all
went away in a Fume, and the Ope∣rator
had his Labour for his Tra∣vel.


In another place were 
Apothecaries

preparing 
Medicines.
 The Outsides
of their Pots were Gilded, with the
Titles of Preservatives, Cordials, and
Panpharmacons; but in the Inside
were Poysons, or more Nauseous Pre∣parations.
However of all our late
pretended Aschimists, commend me
to the Apothecaries, as the Noblest

Operators
 and 
Chimists;
 for out of
Toads, Vipers, and a 
Sir Reverence
it self,
 they will fetch ye Gold ready
Minted, which is more than ever 
Pa∣racelsus

himself pretended to.


Here were also Chirurgeons in great
Numbers, talking hard Words to their
Patients, as Solution of Continuity,
Dislocations, Fractures, Amputation,
Phlebotomy, and spoke 
Greek
 Words,
without understanding the 
English
 of
them. One of the Gravest among
them, propounded this Question to
the rest. Suppose a Man falls from
the 
Main-Yard,
 and lies all Bruised up∣on
the 
Deck;
 Pray what is the 
First
Intention
 in that Case? A Brisk Fel∣low
answers: You must give him



Irish
 Slate 
quantum sufficit,
 and Embro∣cate
the Parts affected 
Secundum Ar∣tem.

At which I seeming to Smile,
another Reprimands me, saying, 
What
do you Laugh at, Sir, the Man's i'th
right on't.
 To whom I reply'd, With
Reverence to your Age and Under∣standing,
Sir, I think he's in the 
wrong;

for if a Man falls from the Main-Yard,
the first Intention is, 
To take
him up again.


Among all these People every thing
is made a Mystery, to detain their
Patients in Ignorance, and keep up
the Market of Physick; but were not
the very Terms of Art, and Names
of their Medicines sufficient to fright
away any Distempers, 'tis to be fear∣ed
their 
Remedies
 would prove worse
than the 
Disease.


That nothing might be wanting in
this Famous College, there were others
that like Porters and Plaisterers stood
ready to be Hired, as 
Corn-Cutters,

and 
Tooth-Drawers.
 The One of
which will make you Halt before the
best Friend you have; and if you do
but 
Yawn,
 the other Knaves will be
examining your 
Grinders;
 Depopu∣late
your Mouths, and make you Old
before your time, and take as much


for Drawing out an Old Tooth, as
would buy a Sett of New ones.


An Ill Accident happened while we
were viewing the Curiosities of this
College. A 
Boy
 had swallowed a
Knife, and the Members of the Col∣lege
being sitting, he was brought a∣mong
them, if it were possible to be
Cured. The 
Chirurgeons
 claim'd the
Patient as belonging to their Fraterni∣ty,
and one of them would have been
poking a Cranes Bill down his Throat
to pluck it up again, but the Doctors
would not suffer him.


After a long Consultation, one of
the two Remedies was agreed on,

viz.
 That the Patient should swallow
as much 
Aqua fortis,
 as would dissolve
the Knife into Minute Particles, and
bring it away by Seige; but the other
Remedy was more Philosophical, and
therefore better approv'd, and that
was to apply a 
Loadstone
 to his Arse,
and so draw it out by a 
Magnetick

Attraction; but which of the two was
put in practice I know not, for I did
not stay to see the Noble Experiment,
tho' my particular Friend Dr. 
W—d

was the first that proposed that Reme∣dy,
and he is no Quack I assure
you.



Not but that there are some Quacks
as Honest Fellows as you would de∣sire
to Piss upon. This Foreigner
here for instance, is a Man of Consci∣ence,
that will take you but Half a
Crown a Bottle for as good 
Lambs-Conduit

Water as ever was in the
World. He pretends it has an Oc∣cult
Quality that Cures all Distem∣pers.
He Swears it, and Swears like

T. O.
 on the right side of the Hedge,
since this very Individual Water has
Cured him of Poverty, which com∣prehends
all Diseases.


'Tis with Physicians in 
London,
 as
with Almanacks, the Newest are the
most Consulted; but then their Reign
like that of an Almanack, concludes
with the Year.


When a Sick Man leaves all for

Nature
 to do, he hazards much. When
he leaves all for the Doctor to do,
he hazards more: And since there
is a Hazard both ways, I would
much sooner chuse to rely upon 
Na∣ture;

for this, at least, we may be
sure of, That she acts as Honest∣ly
as she can, and that she does not
find her Account in prolonging the
Disease.



I pardon those that are brought to
the Extremity of their Lives, to Re∣sign
themselves to the Doctors, as I
pardon those that are at the Extremi∣ty
of their Fortune to abandon them∣selves
to 
Poetry,
 or 
Gaming,








Amusement X.




Gaming-Houses.


GAMING is an Estate to which
all the World has a Pretence,
tho' few espouse it that are willing to
keep either their Estates, or Reputa∣tions.
I knew two 
Middlesex Sharp∣ers

not long ago, which Inherited a
West-Country Gentlemen's Estate;
who, I believe, wou'd have never
made them his Heirs in his last Will
and Testament.


Lantrillou
 is a kind of a Republick
very ill ordered, where all the World
are Hail Fellow well met; no distin∣ction
of Ranks, no Subordination ob∣served.
The greatest Scoundrel of the
Town with Money in his Pockets,
shall take his Turn before the best
Duke or Peer in the Land, if the
Cards are on his side.



From these Priviledg'd-Places, not
only all Respect and Inferiority is Ba∣nish'd;
but every thing that looks
like Good Manners, Compassion, or
Humanity: Their Hearts are so Hard
and Obdurate, that what occasions
the Grief of one Man, gives Joy
and Satisfaction to his next Neigh∣bour.


The 
Gracians
 met together in for∣mer
Times, to see their Gladiators
shew their Valour; that is, to Slash
and Kill one another; and this they
called Sport? What a Cursed Barbari∣ty
was this? But are we a Jot Inferi∣our
to them in this respect, who Chri∣sten
all the Disorders of 
Lansquenet
 by
the Name of Gaming, or to use the
Gamesters own Expression, where a
Parcel of 
Sharks
 meet, 
To Bite one a∣nothers
Heads off.


It happened one Day, that my
Traveller dropt into a Chocolate-House
in 
Covent-Garden,
 where they
were at this Noble Recreation. He
was wonderfully surprized at the Od∣ness
of the Sight. Set your self now
in the room of a Superstitious 
Indian,

who knows nothing of our Customs
at Play, and you will agree that his
Notions, as Abstracted and Visionary


as they may seem, have some Foundati∣ons
in Truth. I present you here with
his own Expressions as I found them
set down in a Letter which he sent in∣to
his own Country.






The Fragments of an Indian
Letter.


THE 
English
 pretend that they
they Worship but one God, but
for my Part, I don't believe what
they say: For besides several Living
Divinities, to which we may see them
daily offer their Vows, they have se∣veral
other Inanimate ones to whom
they pay Sacrifices, as I have obser∣ved
at one of their Publick Meetings,
where I happened once to be.


In this Place there is a great Altar
to be seen, built round and covered
with a Green Whachum, lighted in
the midst, and encompassed by seve∣ral
Persons in a sitting Posture, as we
do at our Domestick Sacrifices.



At the very Moment I came into
the Room, one of those, who I sup∣posed
was the 
Priest,
 spread upon the
Altar certain Leaves which he took out
of a little Book that he held in his
Hand. Upon these Leaves were re∣presented
certain Figures very aw∣kardly
Painted; however they must
needs be the Images of some Divini∣ties;
for in proportion as they were
distributed round, each one of the
Assistants made an Offering to it,
greater or less, according to his De∣votion.
I observed that these Offer∣ing
were more considerable than
those they make in their other Tem∣ples.


After the aforesaid Ceremony is o∣ver,
the Priest lays his Hand in a
trembling manner, as it were, upon
the rest of the Book, and continues
some time in this posture seized with
Fear, and without any Action at all:
All the rest of the Company, atten∣tive
to what he does, are in Suspence
all the while, and unmovable, like
himself. At last every Leaf which
he returns to them, these unmovable
Assistants are all of them in their
Turn possest by different Agitations,
according to the 
Spirit
 which happens


to seize them: One joyns his Hands
together, and 
Blesses Heaven,
 another
very earnestly looking upon his I∣mage,

Grinds his Teeth;
 a third 
Bites
his Fingers and stamps upon the Ground
with his Feet.
 Every one of them, in
short, make such extraordinary Po∣stures
and Contortions, that they
seem to be no longer Rational Crea∣tures.
But scarce has the Priest re∣turned
a certain Leaf, but he is like∣wise
seised by the same Fury with the
rest. 
He tears the Book, and devours
it in his Rage, throws down the Altar,
and Curses the Sacrifice.
 Nothing now
is to be heard but 
Complaints
 and

Groans, Cries
 and 
Imprecations.
 See∣ing
them so Transported, and so Fu∣rious,
I judge that the God they Wor∣ship
is a Jealous Deity, who to Punish
them for what they Sacrifice to others,
sends to each of them an Evil 
Demon

to Possess him.


I have thus shewed you what Judg∣ment
an 
Indian
 would be apt to pass
upon the Transports he finds in our
Gamesters. What wou'd he not
have thought then, if he had seen a∣ny
of our 
Gaming Ladies
 there.



'Tis certain that Love it self as ex∣travagant
as it is, never occasion'd so
many Disorders among the Women,
as the unaccountable Madness of 
Ga∣ming.

How come they to abandon
themselves thus to a Passion that dis∣composes
their Minds, their Healths,
their Beauty, that Ruines—What
was I going to say? But this Picture
does not shew them to Advantage,
let us draw a Curtain over it.


In some Places they call Gaming-Houses

Academies;
 but I know not
why they should inherit that Honou∣rable
Name, since there's nothing to
be learn'd there, unless it be 
Slight of
Hand,
 which is sometimes at the Ex∣pence
of all our Money, to get that
of other Mens by Fraud and Cun∣ning.


The Persons that meet are general∣ly
Men of an 
Infamous
 Character, and
are in various Shapes, Habits, and
Employments. Sometimes they are
Squires of the 
Pad
 and now and then
borrow a little Money upon the 
King's
High-Way,
 to recruit their Losses at
the 
Gaming-House,
 and when a Hue
and Cry is out, to apprehend them,
they are as safe in one of these Hou∣ses,
as a 
Thief in a Mill,
 and practise


the old Trade of 
Cross-biting Cullies,

assisting the Frail 
square Dye
 with
high and low 
Fullums,
 and other 
Nap∣ping

Tricks, in comparison of whom
the common Bulkers, and Pick-Pock∣ets,
are a very honest Society.


How unaccountable is this way to

Beggary,
 that when a Man has but a
little Money, and knows not where
in the World to compass any more,
unless by hazarding his 
Neck
 for't,
will try an Experiment to leave him∣self
none at all: Or, he that has
Money of his own, should play the
Fool, and try whether it shall not be
another Man's. Was ever any thing
so Nonsensically Pleasant?


One idle day I ventur'd into one
of these 
Gaming
-Houses, where I
found an 
Oglio of Rakes
 of several
Humours, and Conditions met toge∣ther.
Some that had lost were Swear∣ing,
and Damning themselves, and
the 
Devil's Bones,
 that had left them
never a Penny to bless their Heads
with. One that had play'd away
even his Shirt and Cravat, and all
his Clothes but his Breeches, stood
shivering in a Corner of the Room,
and another comforting him, and
saying, 
Damme
 Jack, who ever thought


to see thee in a State of Innocency:
Cheer up, Nakedness is the best Re∣ceipt
in the World against a Fevor,
and then fell a Ranting, as if Hell
had broke loose that very Moment.


What the Devil have we here to
do, says my 
Indian,
 do's it Rain
Oaths and Curses in this Country?
I see Gamesters are Shipwrackt be∣fore
they come to understand their
Danger, and loose their 
Clothes
 be∣fore
they have paid their 
Taylors.

They should go to School in my
Country to learn Sobriety and Ver∣tue.
I told him, instead of 
Acade∣mies,

these Places should be call'd

Cheating-Houses:
 Whereupon a Bully
of the 
Blade
 came strutting up to my
very Nose, in such a Fury, that I
would willingly have given half the
Teeth in my Head for a Composition,
crying out, Split my Wind-pipe, Sir,
you are a Fool, and don't understand

Trap,
 the whole World's a Cheat.


The 
Play-House
 cheats you of your
time, and the 
Tradesmen
 of your Mo∣ney,
without giving you either Sense
or Reason for't. The 
Attorney
 picks
your Pocket, and gives you 
Law
 for't;
the 
Whore
 picks your Purse, and gives
you the 
Pox
 for't it; and the 
Poet



picks your Pocket, and gives you
nothing for it. 
Lovers
 couzen you
with their 
Eyes, Orators
 with their

Tongues,
 the 
Valiant
 with their 
Arms,
Fidlers
 with their 
Fingers, Surgeons

with 
Wooden Legs,
 and 
Courtiers
 and

Songsters,
 empty your Pockets, and
give you 
Breath
 and 
Air
 for it: And
why should not we Recruit by the
same Methods that have Ruin'd us.


Our Friends, continued he, gives
us good Advice, and would fain draw
us off from the Course we are in,
but all to no purpose: We ask them
what they would have us do? Mo∣ney
we have none, and without it
there is no Living: Should we stay
till it were brought, or come alone?
How would you have a poor 
Indivi∣duum
Vagum
 live? that has neither
Estate, Office, Master, nor Friend to
maintain him: And is quite out of
his Element, unless he be either in a

Tavern,
 a 
Bawdy-House,
 or a 
Gaming
Ordinary.
 No, we are the Men,
says he, that Providence has appoin∣ted
to live by our Wits, and will not
want while there is Money above
Ground. 
Happy Man catch a Mackeril.

Let the Worst come to'th Worst, a
Wry Mouth on the Tripple Tree, puts


an end to all Discourse about us.


From the Gaming-House we took
our Walk through the Streets, and
the first Amusements we Encountred,
were the Variety and contradictory
Language of the 
Signes,
 enough to
perswade a Man there were no Rules
of Concord among the Citizens. Here
we saw 
Ioseph
's Dream, the 
Bull
 and

Mouth,
 the 
Hen
 and 
Razor,
 the 
Ax

and 
Bottle,
 the 
Whale
 and 
Crow,
 the

Shovel
 and 
Boot,
 the 
Leg
 and 
Star,

the 
Bible
 and 
Swan,
 the 
Frying-Pan

and 
Drum,
 the 
Lute
 and 
Tun,
 the

Hog
 in 
Armour,
 and a thousand others
that the wise Men that put them there
can give no Reason for.


Here walk'd a Fellow with a long
white Rod on his Shoulder, that's a∣sham'd
to cry his Trade, though he
gets his Living by it; another bawl∣ing
out 
TODD
's Four Volumes in
Print, which a Man in Reading of,
wou'd wonder that so much 
Venom

should not tear him to pieces, but
that some of the ancient Moralists
have observed, that the Rankest 
Poy∣son

may be kept in an 
Asses
 Hoof, or
a 
Fool's
 Bosom. Some say, the first
Word he spoke was 
Rascal,
 and that
if he lives to have Chldren, they


will all speak the same Dialect, and
have a Natural Antipathy to 
Eggs,

because their Father was palted with
hundreds of them, when he was dig∣nified
on the Pillory.


Other Amusements presented them∣selves
as thick as Hops, as 
Moses
 Pi∣ctur'd
with 
Horns
 on his Head, to
keep 
Cheapside
 in Countenance. Bi∣shop

Overal
's 
Convocation Book
 Carved
over the Dean of St. 
P—l
's Stall in
that Cathedral. Here sate a Fellow
selling 
little Balls
 to take the Stains
out of the Citizens Wives Petticoats,
that should have been as big as 
Foot-Balls,

if applied to that purpose. Un∣der
that Bulk was a 
Prejector
 clicking
off his 
Swimming Girdles,
 to keep up
Merchants Credits from sinking. A
pretty 
Engine
 to preserve Bankers and
Ensurers from Breaking, and prevent
publishing it in the 
Gazette,
 when
they are Broke; that they will pay
all their Debts as far as it may stand
with their Convenience.


In that Shop was an indebted Lord
talking of his 
Honour,
 and a Trades∣man
of his 
Honesty,
 things that every
Man has, and every thing is, in some
Disguise or other, but duly consider'd,
there are scarce any such things in the


World, unless among Pawn-Brokers,
Stock-Jobbers, and Horse-Coursers;
so that the 
Lord
 and 
Tradesman
 were
discoursing about nothing; and sig∣nified
no more, than the Parson's
Preaching against 
Covetousness
 to the
Maim'd, Blind, and superannuated
Soldiers in 
Chelsey-College,
 nor Dr. 
Sal∣mon
's
prescribing 
Cow Heels
 to a Mar∣ried
Couple, as a conglutinating A∣liment.
But there the 
Weaver
 had
the Afcendant of the 
Doctor.


As we pass'd along, I could not
forbear looking into some of the
Shops, to see how the Owners im∣ployed
themselves in the Absence of
Customers, and in a Barber's Shop I
saw a 
Beau
 so overladen with Wig▪
that there was no difference between
his Head, and the Wooden one that
stood in the Window. The Fop it
seems, was newly come to his Estate,
though not to the years of Discretion,
and was singing the Song. 
Happy is
the Child whose Father is gone to the
Devil, and the Barber all the while
keeping time on his Cittern;
 for you
know a Cittern and a Barber is as
natural as Milk to a Calf, or the Beares
to be attended by a Bag-piper.



In the Scrivener's Shop I saw a
company of Sparks that were selling
their Wives and their Portions, and
Purchasing Annuities; and Old Ten-in-the-Hundred-Fathers,
Damning
themselves to raise their Posterities.
In the Tobacconist's Shops Men were
sneezing and spawling, as if they
were all Clapt, and under a Saliva∣tion
for the cure on't. They that
smoak'd it, were persecuting others
to follow their Example, and they
that snuff'd it up in Powder, were
drawing upon themselves the Incom∣modies
of all Age, in the perpetual
Annoyance of Rheum and Drivel.


Pursuing my Voyage through the
City, and casting a Leere into the
Shops of the Rich 
Drapers, Mercers,

and 
Lacemen,
 I saw them haunted by
many People in Want, especially
young 
Heirs
 newly at Age, and

Spendthrifts,
 that came to borrow
Money of them. Alas, said the
Traders, Times are Dead, and
little Money stirring. All we can
do, is to furnish you with what
the Shop affords; and if a Hundred
Pound or two in 
Commodities
 will do
you any good, they are at your Ser∣vice.
These the 
Gallants
 take up at


an excessive Rate, to sell immediate∣ly
for what they can get▪ and the

Trader
 has his Friend to take them
off Underhand at a third part of the
Value, 
by way of helping Men in Di∣stress.

These are they that inveagle
unthinking Animals, into all sorts of
extravagant Expences, and ruin them
Insensibly under colour of 
Kindness

and 
Credit:
 For they set every thing
at double the Value; and if you
keep not touch at your Day, your
Persons are imprisoned, your Goods
seized, and your Estates extended.
And they that help'd to make you 
Prin∣ces

before, are now the forwardest to
put you into the Condition of 
Beg∣gars.


Among other Amusements, let us
speak a Word or two of 
Lombard-street,

where 
Luxury
 seems to carry us
to 
Peru,
 where you behold their Ma∣gazines,
Ingots of Gold and Silver
as big as Pigs of Lead; and your

Ladies
 after they have travell'd thi∣ther
with some liberal Interloper, car∣ry
home with them more than their
Husbands are worth, and drag at
their long Tails the whole Substance
of a Herd of Creditors. Here are
Jewels and Pearls, Rubies and Dia∣monds,


Broad Pieces, Guineas, 
Lewis
d'Or
's, Crown Pieces, and Dollars
without Number: Nay, in some of
their Shops is nothing to be seen, or
Sold, but great heaps of Money; that
would tempt a Man to think, the
whole 
Indies
 were emptied into one
single Shop 'tis so full of Gold and
Silver; and yet it often happens,
that he that is possest of all this vast
Treasure, is not worth a brass Far∣thing.
To Day his Counters bend un∣der
the weight of 
Cash,
 and to Mor∣row
the Shop is shut up, and you
hear no more of our Goldsmith, till
you find him in a 
Gazette,
 torn to
pieces by a Statute of Bankrupt:
And he and his Creditors made a 
Prey

by a parcel of devouring Vermin,
call'd Commissioners.


The Neighbouring Country is

Stocks-Market,
 where you see a large
Garden, Paved with 
Pibble Stones
 in
all the Beds and Allies; indifferently
open to all Comers and Goers, and
yet bears as good Herbs, Fruits, and
Flowers, as any in the World. Here
is 
Winter
 dress'd in the Livery of 
Sum∣mer.

Every day a Crop is gather'd,
and every Night are stockt up in Ba∣skets,
till the next days Sun does o∣pen
them.



About this Garden great Numbers
of Nymphs reside, who each of them
live in their respective Tubs: They
have not only that in common with

Diogenes,
 but like that Philosopher
also, they speak out freely to the first
Comer whatever comes uppermost.
A further Description I would give
you of their 
Parts,
 and Persons, but
that I cannot endure the smell of the

Serjeants
 at the 
Counter-Gate,
 who
stink worse than old Ling, or 
Assa
faetida,
 and would poyson the Coun∣try,
if this pleasant Garden was not
an Antidote against their Infection.
And therefore I'll go back again into
the Country of






Coffee-Houses.


WHere being arriv'd I am in a

Wood,
 there are so many of
them I know not which to enter.
Stay, let me see! Where the Sign is
Painted with a 
Woman's Hand in't,

'tis a Bawdy-House. Where 
a Man's,

it has another Qualification; but
where it has 
a Star
 in the Sign, 'tis


Calculated for every Leud purpose.


Every Coffee-House is 
Illuminated

both without and within Doors;
without by a fine Glass-Lanthorn,
and within by a Woman so 
Light
 and

Splendid,
 you may see through her
without the help of a Perspective. At
the 
Bar
 the good Man always places
a charming 
Phillis
 or two, who in∣vite
you by their Amorous Glances
into their smoaky Territories, to the
loss of your Sight.


This is the Place where several

Knights Errant
 come to seat themselves
at the same Table, without knowing
one another, and yet talk as familiar∣ly
together, as if they had been of
many years Acquaintance. They
have scarce look'd about them, when
a certain Liquor as 
Black as Soot,
 is
handed to them, which being 
Foppish∣ly

fumed into their Noses, Eyes, and
Ears, has the Vertue to make them
Talk and Prattle together of every
thing but what they should do. Now
they tell their several Adventures by
Sea, and Land. How they Con∣quer'd
the 
Geand,
 were overcome by
the 
Lady,
 and bought a pair of wax'd
Boots at 
Northampton,
 to go a Wooing
in. One was commending his Wife,


another his Horse, and the third said
he had the best smoak'd Beef in 
Chri∣stendom.

Some were discoursing of
all sorts of Government, Monarchi∣cal,
Aristocratical, and Democratical.
Some about the choice of Mayors,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen, and others
of the Transcendent Vertues of Vi∣negar,
Pepper, and Mustard. In short,
I thought the whole 
Room
 was a per∣fect
Resemblance of 
Dover
-Court,
where all Speak, but no body heard
nor answer'd.


To the Charms of 
Coffee,
 the wi∣ser
sort joyn'd 
Spirit
 of 
Clary, Us∣quebaugh,

and 
Brandy,
 which com∣pleatly
Enchants the Knights: By the
force of these Soporiferous Enchant∣ments,
you shall find one Snoar∣ing
heartily on a 
Bench,
 another
makes Love to beautiful 
Phillis
 at
the Bar; and the third as valiant as

Orlando Furioso,
 goes to signalize his
Valour in scouring the Streets.


I should never have done, if I
should attempt to run through all the
several Countries within the Walls of

London;
 as the long Robe, the Sword,
the Treasury. Every State, in brief,
is like a separate Country by its self,
and has its particular Manners and
Gibberish.



Here you may view the Fruitful
Country of 
Trade,
 that has turn'd
Leather Breeches into Gold Chains,
blue Aprons into Fur Gowns, a Kit∣chinstuff
Tub into a gilded Chariot,
a Dray-man into a Knight, and Noble∣men's
Palaces into Shops and Ware-Houses.


Here is also the 
Barren
 Country
of the 
Philosopher's-Stone,
 inhabited
by none but Cheats in the Operation,
Beggars in the Conclusion, and now
is become almost Desolate, till ano∣ther
Age of Fools and Knaves do
People it. To this may be added
the 
Cold Country
 of the 
News-Mongors,

that Report more than they hear,
affirm more than they know, and
swear more than they believe, that
Rob one another, and lye in 
Sheets

for want of a 
Coverlid.
 The 
Hot
Country
 of the Disputers, that quarrel
and raise a Dust about nothing. The

Level Country
 of Bad 
Poets,
 and Pres∣byterian

Parsens:
 One of which is
maintain'd by a good stock of Con∣fidence,
and by the other Flattery and
Canting. The 
Desert uninhabited
Country
 of 
Vertuous
 Women. The

Conquer'd
 Country of 
Coquets,
 and an
infinite Number of others; not to


reckon the 
Lost
 Country inhabited by

Strowlers,
 who aim at nothing but to
lead others out of their way. They
are of easie access, but 'tis dangerous
to Traffick with them. Some of them
have the Art to please without Ma∣nagement,
and to love without Lo∣ving.


But how have I forgot my own

Dear Country,
 that is consecrated to

Bacchus;
 that abounds with 
Nectar,

the Wonder working Liquor of the
World; that makes a 
Poet
 a 
Prince

in's own Conceit; a Coward Vali∣ant,
and a 
Beggar
 as Rich as an 
Al∣derman.

Here I live at Ease, and in
Plenty, Swagger and Carouze, Quar∣rel
with the Master, Fight the Drawer,
and never trouble my self about paying
the 
Reckoning,
 for one Fool or other
pays it for me. A 
Poet
 that has Wit
in his Head, never carries Money in
his Breeches, for fear of creating a
New 
Amusement.


In 
Leicester-Fields,
 I saw a 
Mounte-bank

on the Stage, with a Congre∣gation
of Fools about him, who like
a Master in the Faculty of 
Lying,

gave them a History of his Cures, be∣yond
all the Plays and Farces in the
World. He told them of Fifteen


Persons that were Run clear through
the Body, and glad for a matter of
three Days together, to carry their

Puddings
 in their Hands; but in Four
and twenty Hours he made 'em as whole
as Fishes, and not so much as a 
Scar

for a Remembrance of the Orifice.
If a Man had been so bold as to ask
him when, and where? his Answer
would have been ready without Stu∣dying;
that it was some Twelve hun∣dred
Leagues off in 
Terra Incognito,

by the Token, that at the same time
he was Physician in Ordinary to a
great Prince, that dy'd about Five
and twenty years ago, and yet the

Quack
 was not Forty.


All these Subjects, though very
Amusing, were not equally Edifying,
and therefore in my Voyage towards
the City, I call'd in at a 
Quaker's
Meeting,
 where a Fellow was talking
Nonsence as confidently, as if he had
had a Patent for it, and confirm'd the

Popish
 Maxim, 
That Ignorance is the
Mother of Devotion.
 The Women
were the Oddest Creatures in the
World, neither Flesh nor Fish; but
like 
Frogs,
 only their lower Parts
were Man's Meat.



From thence I sailed into a 
Presby∣terian
Meeting
 near 
Covent-Garden,

where the Vociferous Holder-forth
was as bold and Saucy, as if the Dei∣ty
and all Mankind had owed him
Money. He was shewing the way

to be Rich when Taxes rise, and Trading
falls,
 and Descanting upon all Hu∣mours
and Manners. He (says the
Tubster) that would be Rich accord∣ing
to the Practice of this wicked
Age, must play the 
Thief
 or the 
Cheat;

he that would Rise in the World,
must turn 
Parasite,
 or 
Projector.
 He
that Marries, ventures for the 
Horn,

either before, or afterwards. There
is no Valour without Swearing, Quar∣relling,
or Hectoring. If you are
Poor, no body owns you. If Rich,
you'll know no body. If you dye

young,
 what pity 'twas they'l say,
that he should be cut off in his Prime.
If 
Old,
 he was e'en past his best;
there's no great Miss of him. If
you are Religious, and frequent
Meetings, the World will say you
are a 
Hypocrite:
 And if you go to
Church, and don't make a liberal
Contribution to us, we say you are
a Papist. To which I make bold to
add, If you are 
Gay
 and Pleasant,


you pass for a Buffoon; and if 
Pen∣sive

and Reserv'd, you are taken to
be 
Sour
 and Censorious. 
Courtesy
 is
call'd Colloguing and Currying of Fa∣vour:
Downright Honesty and Plain-Dealing,
is interpreted to be Pride and
Ill Manners: And so I took my leave
of Dr.—


And Peep'd into a 
Fine Church
 in
my Way to 
Fleet-street,
 where a huge
double Belly'd Doctor, was so full of
his 
Doubtlesses,
 that he left no room
for one 
Grain
 of 
Scepticism,
 and made
me so perfect a 
Dogmatist,
 that I made
these Innocent Reflections. The Do∣ctor
is very Fat, 
Doubtless
 he is Rich.
He looks very 
Grum
 and 
Surly, Doubt∣less

he is not the best Humour'd Man
in the World; but I soon gave over
these Remarks; for being a Stranger
to his 
Worship, Doubtless
 I might have
been sometimes in the Right, and

Doubtless
 I should sometimes have been
in the Wrong; and therefore I remo∣ved
my Corps to 
another Church
 in
my Road to 
London.


Here a very Genteel 
Reader,
 to
shew himself 
Frenchify'd,
 instead of
reading 
Porage,
 after our Old Ho∣nest

English
 Custom, gave it an 
A la
Mode
 Turn, and pronounc'd it 
Pot∣taugsh;



whereas to have been more
Modish in his 
Tongue,
 as well as his
othr Parts, he might have called it a

Dish of Soop.


Before Sermon began, the Clark in
a 
Slit Stick
 (contrived for that pur∣pose
at a Serious Consult by the Fa∣mous

Architects
 and 
Engineers,
 Sir 
C. W,

and Col. 
Pickpeper
) handed up to the
Pulpit a Number of 
Prayer-Bills,
 con∣taing
the Humble Petitions of divers

Devoto's,
 for a supply of what they
wanted, and the removal of their Af∣flictions.


One was a Bill from a 
Courtier,
 that
having a good 
Post,
 desired he might
keep it for his Life, without being
call'd to an Account for 
Neglect,
 or

Mismanagement;
 and that he might
continue without controul, God's Ser∣vant
in Ordinary, and the King's Spe∣cial
Favourite.


A Young 
Virgin,
 apprehensive of
her Wants, and Weaknesses, being a∣bout
to enter into the Holy State of

Matrimony,
 prayed for proportionable
Gifts and Graces, 
to enable her for
such an Under-Taking.


Some Pray'd for Good Matches for
their 
Daughters,
 and good Offices for
their 
Sons;
 others beg'd 
Children
 for


themselves: And sure the 
Husband

that allows his Wife to ask Children
Abroad, will be so Civil as to take
them Home when they are given
him.


Now came abundance of 
Bills
 from
such as were going Voyages to Sea,
and others that were taking long
Journeys by Land; both Praying for
the Gift of Chastity for their 
Wives,

and 
Fidelity
 for their 
Prentices,
 till
they should return again. Then the
Bills of Complaint coming in thick and
threefold, 
Humbly shewing
 that many
Citizens Wives, had hard Hearts,
Undutiful Husbands, and Disobedi∣ent
Children, which they heartily
Pray'd to be quit of; I discharg'd my
Ears from their Attendance on so Me∣lancholy
a Subject, and employed my
Eyes on the variety of 
Diverting Fa∣ces

in the Gallery.


Where you might see in one 
Pew,
 a
Covey of Handsome, Bucksome, 
Bona
Roba
's, with High-Heads, and all the

Mundus Muliebris
 of Ornament and
Dress about them, as Merry as 
Hawks

in a Mew, as 
Airy
 as their 
Fans,
 and
as Light as a 
Beaux
 Head, or his 
Fea∣ther.



In another 
Pew
 was a Nest of such
Hard-favour'd 
She's,
 that you would
have blest your self. Some with their
Faces so Pounced and Speckled, as if
they had been 
Scarified,
 and newly
pass'd the 
Cupping-Glass;
 with a World
of little Plasters, 
Large, Round, Square,

and briefly cut out into such variety,
that it would have posed a good 
Ma∣thematician

to have found out another
Figure. They employ'd themselves
while the 
Bills
 were reading, about
—Hush, hush.


The 
Wou'd be Bishop
 is beginning,
and 'tis a sign of a 
Clown,
 as well as
an 
Atheist, Ludere cum Sanct is;
 for tho'
I expose the Foppery of Persons, I
have a great Veneration for Holy Of∣fices.
Our 
Doctor,
 I 
Grant
 it, has
some of the Qualifications of an 
All-Souls

Candidate, 
Bene Vestiti & Me∣diocriter
Docti;
 and in good earnest
fills a Pulpit very well; but that he so
often hauls in his 
Common-Place Book

by Neck and Shoulders, that he cloys
his Auditors with that unpalatable 
Ra∣goust,

called in 
Latin Cramben Biscoctum,

and in plain 
English, Twice-boil'd Cab∣bage;

for having in every Harangue,
let the Subject be what it will, Mar∣shal'd
his Discourse by the help of the



Warlike
 Josephus, 
and by the Assistance
of the Learned
 Grotius, 
and Pious
Dr.
 Hammond 
our own Countryman, puz∣zled

Aquinas, 
Confuted
 Bellarmin, 
and
Baffled
 Origen, 
pass we on
 (says he) 
to
the next thing as considerable.


The 
Clark
 is such an Affected C. C.
C—, that he Sings out of Tune,
says out of Order, and does nothing
as he should do: For instead of say∣ing,

Amen,
 he Screams out 
A Main,

which had like to put me into a Con∣founded
Fit of Laughter; for a Spark
who had been Over-night at 7 or 11,
falling Asleep in the Church, and be∣ing
waked by the Noise of 
A Main,

he starts up, and cries out aloud, 
I'll
Set you Half a Crown


Crowding to get out to breath my
Spleen at this Adventure, I put the

Bilk
 upon a 
Pick-Pocket;
 who measu∣ring
my Estate by the Length and Bul∣kiness
of my 
New Wig, which (God
knows) is not paid for,
 he made a Dive
into my Pocket, but encountring a
Disappointment, Rub'd off, Cursing
the 
Vacuum;
 and I as heartily laugh∣ing
at his 
Folly,
 that could think a

Poet
 ever went to Church, when he
had Money to go to a Tavern. Poets
are better Principled than to hoard up



Trash;
 and could they as well secure
themselves from the 
Flesh
 and the 
De∣vil,

as they do from the 
World,
 there
would not be a Hairs breadth 'twixt
them and Heaven.


Now I cross'd the way to a 
Book∣sellers,

in hopes to get a Dinner and
a Bottle; but the Stingy Curr pop't
me off with a Dish of 
Coffee,
 and the
old Talk that Trading was Dead, that
they suffer'd for other Mens Works as
well as their own; and in short, find∣ing
not a 
Penny
 to be screw'd out of
the 
Prig,
 I pursued my Voyage to the
City; but it happening to Rain, to
shelter my self from it, I run my Face
into






A Heralds Office.


HERE was a Confounded Noise
of Descents, Pedigrees, Ge∣nealogies,
Coat Armour, Bearings,
Additions, Abatements, and a deal
of that insignificant Jargon. While I
was listening to this 
Gibberish,
 in
comes a Fellow with a Role of Parch∣ment


in his Hand, to be made a 
Gen∣tleman,

and to have a Coat of Arms
finely Painted to hang up in his 
Din∣ing-Room

till his Wife Died, and then
to be transported on the Outside and
Front of the House, to Invite a Rich
Widdow to Marty him.


My 
Father,
 says he, has bore Arms
for His Majesty, in many Honourable
Occasions of 
Watching
 and 
Warding;

and has made many a 
Tall Fellow
 speak
to the Constable at all Hours of the
Night. My 
Uncle
 was the first Man
that ever was of the Honourable 
Order

of the 
Black-Guard:
 And we have had
five Brave Commanders of our Fami∣ly,
by my Father's side, that have
served the 
State
 in the Quality of

Marshal's Men,
 and 
Thief Takers,
 and
gave His Majesty a fair Account of all
the 
Prisoners
 that were taken by them:
And by my 
Mothers side,
 it will not
be denied, but that I am Honourably
Descended; for my 
Grandmother
 was
never without a Dozen Chamber-Maids
and Nurses in Family. Her
Husband wore a Sword by his Place,
for he was 
Deputy-Marshal;
 and to
prove my self a Man of 
Honour,
 I
have here a Testimonial in my Hand,
in Black and White; and in my Poc∣ket


brave 
Yellow-Boys,
 to pay for a
Coat of Arms: Which being produ∣ced
and Finger'd by the Herald, he
immediately assign'd him a 
Coat, viz.

A 
Gibbet
 Erect, with a Wing Volant.
A Ladder Ascendant. A Rope Pen∣dant,
and a 
Marshal's Man
 Swinging
at the end on't.


I am Sandalized, says my 
Indian,

at your Custome in 
London,
 in ma∣king
every Saucy 
Iack,
 a Gentle∣man.


And why are you not as well of∣fended,
reply'd I to my 
Indian,
 to
hear almost every 
Gentleman
 call one
another 
Iack,
 and 
Tom,
 and 
Harry

They first dropt the Distinction, Pro∣per
to Men of 
Quality,
 and Scoun∣drels
took it up and bestowed it upon
themselves; and hence it is, that a

Gentleman
 is sunk into plain 
Iack,
 and

Iack
 is rais'd into 
Gentleman.


In Days of 
Yore,
 a Man of 
Honour

was more Distinguishable by his 
Ge∣nerosity

and Affability, than by his

Lac'd Liveries;
 but too many of them
having degenerated into the Vices of
the Vulgar Fry, Honour is grown
Contemptible, the Respect that is
due to their 
Births,
 is lost in a 
Savage



Management, and is now assumed by
every Scoundrel.


The Cobler is Affronted, if you
don't call him Mr. 
Translator.
 The
Groom Names himself 
Gentleman of
the Horse,
 and the Fellow that carries

Guts
 to the 
Bears,
 writes himself 
one of
His Majesty's Officers.
 The Page calls
himself 
a Child of Honour,
 and the
Foot-Boy stiles himself my 
Ladies
Page.
 Every Little 
Nasty Whore
 takes
upon her the Title of 
Lady,
 and eve∣ry

Impudent Broken-Mouth'd Manteau-Maker,

must be call'd 
Madam Theodosia
Br—.
 Every Dunce of a 
Quack,
 is call'd
a 
Physician.
 Every Gown-Man, a 
Coun∣seller.

Every Silly Huff, a 
Captain.
 Eve∣ry

Gay
 thing, a Chevalier. Every Parish
Reader, a 
Doctor:
 And every 
Writing
Clerk
 in the Office, Mr. 
Secretary:

Which is all but Hypocrisie and Kna∣very
in Disguise; for nothing is now
called by its right Name.


The Heralds I see have but little to
do, Honour and Arms which used to
employ all Men of Birth and Parts,
is now almost dwindled into an Airy
Nothing: Let us then go and see how
the World wags in the City Circle.










Amusement XI.




The City Visiting-Day.


I Have given my Traveller Walk∣ing
enough from Country to Coun∣try,
let us save him the trouble now
of Beating the Hoof, and shew him
the rest of the World as he sits in his
Chair.


To be acquainted with all the Dif∣ferent
Characters of it, it will be suf∣ficient
for him to frequent certain
Numerous Assemblies, a sort of 
City
Circle,
 they are set up in imitation of
the Circle at Court.


The Circle in Foreign Courts is a
Grave Assembly, but ill seated upon
Low Stools set in a Round. Here all
Women Talk, and none of them Li∣sten.
Here they make a Pother about
nothing. Here they Decide all things,
and their most diversified Conversati∣ons


ons are a sort of Roundeaus that end
either in Artificial Slanders, or gross
Flattery, but this being in no wise ap∣plicable
to the 
English
 Court, I shall
wave a further Description of it, and
come to






The City Circle.


WHICH is a Familiar Assembly,
or a General Council of the
Fair and Charming-Sex, where all the
Important Affairs of their Neighbors
are largely discuss'd, but Judged in an
Arbitrary Manner, without hearing
the Parties speak for themselves. No∣thing
comes amiss to these Tribunals.
Matters of High, and no Consequence,
as Religion, and Cuckoldom, Com∣modes
and Sermons, Polliticks and
Gallantry, Receipts of Cookery and
Scandal, Coquettry and Preserving,
Jilting and Laundry; in short every
thing is subject to the Jurisdiction of
this Court, and no Appeal lies from
it.



A Venerable Old Gentlewoman,
call'd Madam 
Whimsey,
 whose Relati∣ons
are dispersed into all Corners of
the Earth, is President of this Board.
She is Lineally Descended from the

Maggots
 of the 
South,
 an Illustrious
and Ancient Family, that were a Branch
of the 
Wag-Tails
 of the 
East,
 who
boast themselves Descended in a Right
Line from Madam 
Eve.
 Here are to
be found as many Different Opinions
as there are Heads in the Room. The
same Judge is sometimes Severe, and
sometimes Indulgent, sometimes Grave
and sometimes Trifling, and they
Talk exactly there, as I do in my 
A∣musements.


They pass in a Moment from the
most Serious, to the most Comical
Strain; from the greatest things to the
smallest; from a Duke, to a Chim∣ney-Sweeper;
from a Council of War
to a Christning, and sometimes a sud∣den
Reflexion upon a Womans 
Head-Dress,

hinders the Decision of a Case
of Conscience under Examination.


In this Country Twenty several
Sentences are pronounced all at once.
The Men Vote when they can, the
Women as often as they please. They
have two Votes for one. The great


Liberty that is allowed in the City
Circle, invites all sorts of Persons to
come thither to see and to be seen.
Every one talks according to his De∣signs,
his Inclination, and his Genius.
The Young Folks talk of what they
are now a doing; the Old Fellows
Talk of what they have done in the
Days of Queen 
Dick;
 and your Sots
and Coxcombs of what they have a
design to do, tho' they never go a∣bout
it.


The Ambitious Rail at the Slug∣gards
as a Company of Idle Fellows
that take up a room in the World, and
do nothing? The Sluggards return
back the Compliment to the Ambiti∣ous,
that they trouble all the World
with their Plots to advance themselves
and ruine others. The Tradesman
Curses War from the bottom of his
Heart, as that which spoils Commerce,
Depopulates Countries, and destroys
Mankind; and the Soldier wishes
those that had a Hand in making the
Peace, were at the Devil.


The Vertuoso despises the Rich for
making such a bustle about so Foolish
and Pale-faced a Mettal as Gold. The
Rich laugh at Learning, and Learned
Men, and cry, A fig for 
Aristotle



and 
Des Cartes.
 Your Men of Gravi∣ty
and Wisdom forsooth, rail at Love
as the most Foolish and Impertinent Tri∣fling
thing in the World; and the Lover
fattens himself with his own Fancies,
and laughs at Wisdom as a Sower and
Severe thing that is not worth the Pur∣suit.
Those that are Unmarried fall
foul upon the Jealous-Pated Hus∣bands,
as Men that create their own
Troubles. And those that are Marri∣ed
justify their own Prudent Conduct
in endeavouring to prevent their own
Dishonour.


A Young forward Puppy full of
Vigour and Health, seem'd to inti∣mate
by his Discourse, that he thought
himself Immortal. Well, says he, I
have drank my Gallon of Claret eve∣ry
Night this Seven Years, and yet
the Devil of a Feaver or any other Di∣sease
dares Attack me, tho' I always
keep two or three Sins going at once.
Before 
George
 I think our Family's
made of Iron. There's that Old Prig
my Father (a Plague on him) turn'd of
Seventy, and yet he's as sound as a
Roach still. He'll ride you Forty Mile
out-right at a Fox-Chase. Small-Beer
be my Portion here and hereafter, if I
believe he'll ever have the Good Man∣ners
to troop off.



A Grave Old Gentleman offended
at this Rude and Frothy Discourse
gave his Whiskers a Twirl, and thus
repremanded our Saucy Whipper-Snapper.
Know Boy, cries he to him
in an Angry Tone: Know, Sirrah,
that every Age stands upon the same
Level as to the Duration of Life. A
Man of Fourscore is Young enough
to Live, and an Infant but of Four
Days Birth, is Old enough to Die.


I apprehend your Meaning, Old
Gentleman, says our Young Prig to
him, well enough. You are Young
enough to Live to Day, and Old e∣nough
to Die to Morrow.


Those whom you have hitherto
heard, talk'd only to let the Compa∣ny
see what they were: The rest both
in their Conversation and Manners,
appear'd directly contrary to what
they were.


You admire the Gay Noisy Im∣pertinence
of that Country Wit yon∣der,
that tells of many Pleasant Sto∣ries,
and sets all the Company a
Laughing. Don't be mistaken in him,
he's the Dullest Rogue alive, if you
strip him of what he has Plunder'd
from others.



All his Jests and Repartees he Pur∣loin'd
from his 
Fathers Chaplain;
 they
are the effect of his Memory, and not
of his Invention.


That other Spark there sets up for
a 
Wit,
 and has some Sence to't. Pray
mind that Worshipful 
Lump
 of Clay,
that Inanimate Figure that lolls in the
Elbow-Chair; he takes no manner of
Notice of what is said in the Compa∣ny.
By his Plodding Starch'd Solemn
Looks, you would conclude that Busi∣ness
of Importance, and Affairs of
State, took up all his Thoughts, and
that his Head was brim full of Dis∣patches,
Negotiations, Decrees, Or∣ders
of Council, and the Lord knows
what. I'll tell you what; he's the
Emptiest, Dullest, Shallowest Mon∣ster,
within the Bills of Mortality.
He's equally incapable of Business and
Pleasure: He'll take you a Nap over
a Game at 
Cards,
 and Yawn and
Stretch at the most diverting 
Comedy:

Nay, under the 
Pulpit
 when the Par∣son
has Preach'd all the Dogs out o'th'
Church. He Dreams as he Walks,
and the Sot when he's a Sleep, differs
from the Sot when Waking, as a

Nine-Pin
 when it is up, differs from a

Nine-Pin
 when its down. He has a


Considerable Post in the Government,
and a Pretty Wife, and minds them
both alike? 'Tis pity he has not a

Deputy
 to officiate for him.


That 
Young Creature
 there by the
Window, at the bare mention of the
Word 
Love,
 Starts, and Trembles, as
if a 
Demi-Culvirin
 were shot off at her
Ear. Her Vertuous Mother has told
her such terrible Stories about it, that
the 
Poor Fool
 believes she hates it.
And do you think, Sir, she'll hate it
to the end of the Chapter? That's not
so certain, I dare not engage for it. A
Woman that hates Love before she
knows 
what it is,
 is not in danger to
hate it very long.


Perhaps I explain things after a

Freer
 manner than I ought, and 
Un∣mask

too many Faces in my Circle;
but if I were never so much inclined
to spare them, and they themselves
had Address enough to conceal their
own Defects: I see a 
Lady
 of great
Penetration coming into the Room,
who will decipher them more 
Unmerci∣fully

than I can.


Now she has Seated her self. Ob∣serve
what a 
Modest
 Air she has? How
Critically she draws off her Gloves?
How 
Artfully
 she manages her Fan?


And if she lift up her Eyes, 'tis only
to see whether other Women are as
Handsome and as Modest as her self.
She has so much Vertue the World
says, that she can't endure any that
have a less share on't than her self.
What is harder still, those that have
more Vertue than she, do equally dis∣please
her. 'Tis for this reason she
spares no Body.


I ask'd a Lady of the same Chara∣cter
t'other Day, how it came to pass
that her Exhortations were half 
God∣liness,

and half 
Slander?
 Bless me,
crys she, 
Slander!
 What mean you
by the Word? 'Tis enough to give
one the Spleen, or an 
Augue Fit.
 The
Truth on't is, I am sometimes obli∣ged
to accommodate my self to the

Taste
 of the World, to 
Season
 my Re∣monstrances
with a little 
Satyr,
 for
the World expects we should make
every thing agreeable, even Conne∣ction
it self. We must sometimes give
a little 
Slip
 from Morality, to bring
in a few 
Strokes
 of Satyr. Speak
more Honestly, 
Madam,
 says I to her,
and confess that you bring in one
stroke of Morality, to countenance
the making of a Thousand Scandalous
Reflexions.



Very well, replies the 
Indian
 to me,
I find the 
Londoners
 are as Comical in
their Garbs, as affected in their Discour∣ses.
They would think themselves 
disho∣nour'd

to appear in a Suit they wore last
Year. According to the Rule of 
Fashions,

this Furious Beau the next Year must
make but a 
Scurvy Figure;
 but I par∣don
them for following the Custom of
their Country. I put so ill a Constru∣ction
upon their Curiosity, I will not
hereafter Judge of the Hearts of Wo∣men
by the Steps I see them make.


As for that 
Beau
 yonder, I have a
great Curiosity to know whither his
Inside answers his Outside. Not a
Word has drop'd from him as yet;
but surely the 
Oracle
 will open Anon.
The Ladies that encompass him, said
I to my Curious Traveller, are as im∣patient
to hear him Talk, as you can
be. Therefore let us listen.


They all Compliment, and address
their Discourses to him. What An∣swers
does he make them? Sometimes

Yes,
 and sometimes 
No,
 and some∣times

Nothing
 at all. He speaks to
one with his 
Eyes,
 to another with
his 
Head,
 and 
Laughs
 at a third with
so 
Mysterious
 an Air, that 'tis believed
there is something extraordinary meant


by it. All the Company are of Opi∣nion
that he has 
Wit
 in abundance.
His Physiognomy 
Talks,
 his Air 
Per∣swades,

but all his Eloquence lies in
the Fine 
Outside
 he makes; and as soon
as the Spark has shew'd himself, 
he
has concluded his speech.
 'Tis a thou∣sand
pitties that Nature had not time
enough to finish her Workmanship▪
Had she bestowed never so little 
Wit

upon an 
Outside
 so Prepossessing us in
his Favour, the Idlest Tales from his
Mouth wou'd have pass'd for the most
Ingenious Story in the World.


But our Ladies now begin to be
weary of holding a longer Discourse
with their Idol, All of 'em resolv'd, if
they must speak, to speak with some
Body that would answer them again,
and not with a 
Statue.
 Our Beau re∣tires
into the next Chamber, intent
upon nothing but how to display his
Charms to the best advantage. He is
at first view enamour'd with a Pretty
Lady whom he saw in the Room. He
Besieges her with his 
Eyes,
 he 
Ogles

at her, he 
Prims
 and 
Plumes
 himself,
and at last he Boards her.


This 
Lady
 is very Reserved, and
tho' our Gentleman appear very
Charming to her, yet she is not sur∣prized


at the first sight of him. 'Tis
nothing but her Curiosity which makes
her hazard meeting him in the Field.
With this Intention she listens to what
our Adventurer has to say to her. In
short, this was the success of his Af∣fair
with her.


He found himself mightily at a loss
how to 
Cope
 with this Lady. She had
an inexhaustible Source of 
Wit,
 and
would not be paid with 
Gracious Nods
and Smiles,
 but as we see there are a
Hundred Witty Women in the World,
that are not displeas'd with a fair Out∣side;
our Confident Spark flatter'd
himself, that if he cou'd but once per∣swade
the Lady that he was in Love
with her, the Garrison wou'd imme∣diately
surrender. To effect this he
employ'd the 
Finest Turns
 of Elo∣quence,
and the most touching Ex∣pressions
of the 
Mute Language;
 but
this Fair Lady made as if she did not
understand him. What should he now
do to explain himself more clearly to
her. He had a 
Diamond-Ring
 of a
considerable Value upon his Finger,
and found himself put to't to contrive
a Piece of Gallantry 
A la Mode,
 to
present it to her. Thus 
Playing
 with
his Hand, and holding it so that he


might shew his 
Diamond
 more advan∣tageously
to the Eyes of the Fair In∣different,
he plays with it: She turns
her Head, first on one side, then on
the other side. This Unconcernedness
mortified him extreamly; yet still he
kept on his 
Shew,
 which is always the
last Refuge of a Coxcomb. He is A∣stonish'd
to find a Woman insensible to
such a 
Beau
 as himself, and to such a

Diamond
 as his was; but this made no
Impression on the 
Lady,
 who still con∣tinued
Inexorable and Cruel.


At the very Moment he despair'd
of his Enterprize, this Cruel, this
Insensible seiz'd him hastily by the
Hand, to look nearer at the 
Diamond,

from which she first turn'd her Eyes:
What a 
Blessed turn
 of the Scene was
this to a Dejected Lover! He reas∣sumes
his Courage, and to make a De∣claration
of his Passion for once and
all, he takes the 
Ring
 from his Finger,
and after a Thousand 
Cringes
 and 
Gri∣maces,

Presents her with it. The 
Lady

takes it in her Hand, and holds it close
to her Eyes, to view it more careful∣ly:
He redoubles his Hope and Assu∣rance,
and thought he had a Right to
Kiss that Hand, that had received his

Diamond.
 The Lady was so taken up


in looking at it, that she was not at
leisure to think of being angry at this
Freedom; but on the contrary smiled,
and without any more Ceremony put
the 
Ring
 upon her Finger.


Now it is that our Lover thinks
himself secure of 
Victory,
 and tran∣sported
with Joy, proposes the 
Hour

and 
Place
 of Meeting. Sir, says this
Lady coldly to him, I am Charm'd
with this 
Diamond;
 and the reason
why I have accepted it without Scru∣ple,
is because it belongs to me. 
Yes,
Sir,
 this Diamond is mine; my Hus∣band
took it from off my 
Toilet
 some
Three Months ago, and made me af∣terwards
believe he had lost it. That
cannot be, replys our 
Fop,
 it was a

Marchioness
 that exchang'd it with me
for something that shall be Name∣less.


Right, right,
 continues the Woman,

my Husband was acquainted with this

Marchioness, 
he
 Truck'd 
with her for my

Diamond, 
the Marchioness
 Truck'd 
with
you for it, and I take it for nothing; tho
if I were of a
 Revengeful 
Nature, my
Husband very well
 deserves, 
that I
should give the same Price for it, as he
received from the Marchioness.
 At this
unexpected Blow, our Fine Thing


stood Confounded and Astonish'd; but
I can now forgive his 
being Mute
 up∣on
so Odd an Occasion. A Man of
Wit and Sence could hardly avoid
it.


That Great 
Lord
 yonder, was Bred
and Born a 
Lord:
 His 
Soul
 is full as
Noble as his 
Blood,
 his Thoughts as
high as his Extraction. I Esteem, but
don't Admire his 
Lordship;
 but the
Man, who by his 
Merits
 and 
Vertues

raises himself above his Birth and E∣ducation,
I both 
Esteem
 and 
Admire.


Why then should you, whose Vir∣tues
equal your Fortune, conceal the

Meanness
 of your Original, which
raises the Lustre of your Merit? And
as for you that have no other Merit
to boast of, but that of advancing
your Fortune; never be ashamed to
own the Meanness of your former
Life: We shall better esteem the Merit
of your Elevation.


Look, yonder goes a Man, says
one, that takes upon him so much of
the 
Lord,
 that one would think he
had never been any thing else. It of∣ten
happens, that by our Over-acting
of Matters, the World discovers we
were not always the Men we ap∣pear.



While I made my Reflections, my

Indian
 was likewise busie in making
his. He did not so much wonder at
the Man in the Embroidered Coat,
who did not know himself, as at the
Assembly, who likewise seem'd not
to know him. He was treated with
the Respect due to a Prince; these
are not Civilities, but downright A∣dorations.
What cannot you be con∣tent,
says our 
Indian,
 cannot you be
content to Idolize 
Riches
 that are use∣ful
to you? Must you likewise Ido∣lize
the 
Rich,
 who will never do you
a Farthings-worth of Kindness?


I confess, continued he, that I can∣not
recover out of this Astonishment.
I see another Man of a very good
Look come into the 
Circle,
 and no
body takes the least Notice of him.
He has seated himself and Talks,
and very much to the purpose too,
and yet no one will vouchsafe him a
Hearing. I observe, the Company
Files off from him by degrees, to a∣nother
part of the Room, and now
he is lest alone by himself. Where∣fore
say I to my self, Do they shun
him thus? Is his 
Breath
 Contagious,
or has he a 
Plague-Sore
 running upon
him?



At the same time I took Notice,
That these Deserters had flock'd a∣bout
the 
Gay Coxcomb
 in the laced
Suite, whom they worshipp'd like a
little God. By this I came to un∣derstand,
that the Contagious Di∣stemper
the other Man was troubled
with was his Poverty.


Oh Heavens!
 says the 
Indian,
 fal∣ling
all on the sudden into an Enthu∣siastick
Fit, like that wherein you
saw him in his Letter; 
Oh Heavens!

Remove me quickly out of a Coun∣try,
where they shut their Ears to
the wholsom Advice, and sage In∣structions
of a 
Poor
 Man, to lissen
to the Nonsensical 
Chat
 of a Sot in

Gawdy
 Cloathes. They seem to re∣fuse
this 
Philosopher
 a Place among
Men, because his Apparel is but in∣different,
while they Rank that Weal∣thy
Coxcomb in the Number of the
Gods. When I behold this Abomi∣nable
Sight, I cou'd almost pardon
those that grow Haughty and Inso∣lent
upon Prosperity. This latter
Spark a little while ago was less than
a 
Man
 among you, at present you
make a sort of a 
Deity
 of him. If
the Head of their new Idol should
grow Giddy, he may e'en thank those


who Incense him at this abominable
Rate.


There are among us in my Coun∣try,
continues he, a sort of People
who Adore a certain Bird, for the
Beauty and Richness of its 
Feathers.

To justifie the Folly wherein their
Eyes have engaged them, they are
perswaded that this proud Animal has
a Divine Spirit that Animates him.
Their Error is infinitely more excu∣sable
than yours; for in short, this
Creature is 
Mute,
 but if he could
Talk, like your Brute there in the
Rich Embroidery, they would soon
find him out to be a Beast, and per∣haps
would forbear to Adore him.


This sudden Transport, carry'd
our well-meaning Traveller a little
too far. To oblige him to drop his
Discourse, I desir'd him to cast his
Eyes upon a certain Gentleman in
the 
Circle,
 who deserved to have his

Veil
 taken off with which he covered
himself, to procure the Confidence of
Fools. Examine well this serious Ex∣travagant.
The 
Fool's Bawble
 he makes
such a pother with, is his 
Probity,

an amiable thing indeed, if his Heart
were affected by it; but 'tis only the
Notion of it that has Fly-blown his


Head. Because, forsooth, it has not
yet appear'd in his Story, that he is
a Notorious Cheat and Falsifier, up∣on
the Merit of this Reputation, the

Insect
 thinks himself the most Virtu∣ous
Man in the World. He demands
an Implicite Faith to all he says. You
must not question any thing he is
pleas'd to affirm, but must pay the
same Deference to his Words, as to
the Sacred Oracles of Truth it self.
If he thinks fit to assert that 
Romulus

and 
Remus
 were Grand Children to

Iohn of Gaunt,
 'tis a Breach of Good
Manners to enquire into their Pedi∣grees.


If any Difference happens, he pre∣tends
his Word is a Decree, from
which you cannot Appeal without
Injustice. He takes it for a high Af∣front,
if you do but ask him to give
you the common Security. All the
Universe must understand that his
Verbal Promise is worth a thousand
Pounds. He would fain have per∣swaded
his 
Wifes Relations
 to have
given him her in Marriage upon his
bare Word, without making a Settle∣ment.
He affects to be exactly Nice
to a Tittle in all his Expressions, and
if you think it impossible to find a



Model
 of this impracticable Exactness,
he tells you that you may find it in
him, all his Words you ought to be∣lieve
to a Hairs breadth: Nothing
less, and nothing beyond it. If ever
he gives you liberty to 
Stretch
 a little,
it must be in his Commendation.
Let the Conversation turn upon what
Subject it pleases, be it of 
War,
 or
of 
Religion, Morality,
 or 
Politicks,
 he
will perpetually thrust his 
Nose
 into
it, though he is sure to be laughed
at for his Pains, and all to make a
fine 
Parade
 of his own good Quali∣ties
and Vertues.


A certain 
Lady
 for Instance, after
she had effectually proved that all
Gallantry, and Sincerity, was extinct
among the young Fellows of this
Age, corrected her self pleasantly in
this manner. I am in the 
wrong
 Gentle∣men,
says she, I am in the 
wrong,
 I
own it. There is such a thing as
Sincerity still among the Men: 
They
speak all that they think of us
Women.


Upon the bare Mention of the
Word 
Sincerity,
 our Gentleman
thought he had a fair opportunity to
enlarge upon his own. Every Man,


says he, has his particular Faults
My Fault is to be too Sincere.


Soon after this, the Discourse fell
upon other Matters, as want of Com∣passion
and Charity in the Rich.
What an excess of Barbarity crys
our Man of Honour, is this? For
my part, I always fall into the op∣posite
Extream. I 
melt
 at every
thing, I am 
too Good
 in my Temper,
but 'tis a Fault I shall never Correct
in my self. To make short, another
who towards the Conclusion of his
Story, happen'd accidentally to let
the Word Avarice drop from him,
found himself interrupted by our

Modest
 Gentleman, who made no dif∣ficulty
to own that 
Liberality
 was his
Vice. 
Ah Sir,
 replied the Man cold∣ly,
who was interrupted, you have
three great Vices, Sincerity, Good∣ness,
and Liberality. This excess of
Modesty in you, which makes you
own these Vices, give me to under∣stand
Sir, that you are Masters of all
the 
contrary Vertues.


In my Opinion now, this was
plucking off the Vizor of our Sir

Formal.
 This was discharging a 
Pi∣stol

at his Breast: One would have


thought it wou'd have went to the
very Heart of him. In the mean
time he did not so much as feel the
Blow; the 
Callus
 of his Vanity had
made him invulnerable, he takes
every thing you say to him in good
part. Call him in an Ironical man∣ner,
the 
Great Heroe of Probity,
 he
takes you in the Litteral Sense. Tell
him in the plain Language of 
T. O.

that he's 
a confounded Rascal,
 Oh Sir,
says he, your humble Servant, you
are disposed to be merry I find: thus
he takes it for Raillery.


These 
Raillers
 have a fine time
on't you see, to 
Iest
 upon a Man of
so 
Oily
 a Temper. What a Vexation
is it to your Gentlemen that speak
sharp and witty Things, to level
them at so 
supple
 a Slave. All the
Pleasure wou'd be to touch him to
the Quick, to confound his Vanity.
Wit does but hazard it self by At∣tacking
him in the Face, there's no∣thing
to be got by it: 
Vanity is a
Wall of Brass.


But I find nothing will be lost.
There sits a Gentleman in the corner
of a quite different Temper, who
takes every thing upon himself, that


was meant to another. He 
Blushes,

he grows 
Pale,
 he's out of Counte∣nance;
at last quits the Room, and
as he goes out, threatens all the Com∣pany
with his Eyes. What does the
World think of this holding up the

Buckler,
 they put but a bad Constru∣ction
upon it, and say that his Con∣science
is 
Ulcerated,
 that you cannot
touch any String, but it will answer
to some painful place. 
Touch a Gall'd
Horse and He'll Wince.
 In a word,
he's wounded all over, because he's
all over Sensible of Pain.


These are two Characters that
seem to be directly opposite; how∣ever,
it were easie to prove that these
two are the same at Bottom. What's
this Bottom? Divine it if you can:
One Word wou'd not be sufficient to
explain it clearly to you, and I am
not at leisure to give you any more.
I perceive a Man coming into the
Room whom I am acquainted with,
he will interrupt me without Re∣morse.
I had better be beforehand
with him, and hold my Tongue.


Silence
 Gentlemen, 
Silence,
 and
see you shew due Respect. You
will immediately see one of those



Noble Lords
 who believe that all is
due to them, and that they owe no∣thing
to any Body. When my 
Lord

enter'd, every one put on a demure
Look, and he himself came in with
a 
Smiling
 look, like a true Polititian.
Immediately he makes a thousand
Protestations of Friendship to every
one; but at the same time that he
promises you his Service, he looks
as Pale as a 
Scotchman,
 when he of∣fers
you his Purse.


He is scarce sate down in his Chair,
but he embroiles the Conversati∣on.
He talks to four several Persons
about four several Affairs at once:
He puts a 
Question
 to one Man, with∣out
waiting for an 
Answer
 of ano∣ther:
He proposes a 
Doubt,
 Treats
it, and resolves it all by himself. He's
not weary of 
Talking,
 though all the
Company be of 
hearing
 him. They
steal off by degrees, and so the Circle
ended.


The 
Publick
 is a great Spectacle
always New, which presents it self
to the Eyes of private Men, and 
A∣muses

them. These private Men are
so many diversified Spectacles, that
offer themselves to the Publick View,


and 
Divert
 it. I have already as it
were in 
Minature,
 shew'd some few
of these small inconsiderable private
Spectacles. My Fellow Traveller not
content with this, still demands of
me, that I should speak a few Words
more of the 
Publick.










Amusement XII.


The PVBLICK.


THE 
Publick
 is a 
Prince
 of which
all those Hold, that aim at Ho∣nour,
Reputation and Profit. Those
Sordid Mean-Spirited 
Souls,
 that don't
take any Pains to merit its Approba∣tion,
are at least afraid of its Hatred,
and Contempt. The Right we as∣sume
to our selves to Judge of every
thing, has produc'd abundance of
Vertues, and stifled abundance of
Crimes.


The 
Publick
 has a Just, a Solid, and
Penetrating Discernment: In the mean
time, as 'tis wholly composed of
Men; so there's a great deal of the

Man
 very often in its Judgments. It
suffers it self to be Prepossessed as well
as a Private Person, and afterwards
prepossesseth us by the Ascendant it
hath had over us for many Ages.



The 
Publick
 is a true 
Misanthrope,
 it
is neither guilty of 
Complaisance,
 nor

Flattery;
 nor does it seek to be Flat∣ter'd.
It runs in Crowds to Assem∣bles,
where it hears Truths of it self,
and each of the Particulars that com∣pose
the whole Body, love rather to
see themselves 
Ieer
'd, than to deprive
themselves of the Pleasure of seeing
others 
Ieer'd.


The 
Publick
 is the Nicest and most
Severe 
Critick
 in the World; yet a
Dull Execrable 
Ballad,
 is enough to

Amuse
 it for a whole Year. It is both
Constant and Inconstant. One may
truly affirm, that since the Creation,
the Publick 
Genius
 has never changed.
This shews its 
Constancy;
 but it is fond
of Novelties, it daily changes all its
Fashions of acting, its Language and
its Modes. A 
Weather-Cock
 is not
more 
Inconstant.
 It is so 
Grave
 it strikes
a Terror upon those that Talk to it,
and yet so 
Trifling
 that a 
Band,
 or a

Cravat
 put the wrong way, sets the
whole Auditory a Laughing.


The 
Publick
 is served by the greatest

Noblemen:
 What Grandeur is there?
And yet it depends upon those that
serve it: How 
Little
 it is?



The 
Publick
 is, if I may allow my
self the Expression, always at Man's
Estate, for the Solidity of its Judg∣ment,
and yet an 
Infant,
 whom the
errantest Scoundrel of a 
Iack-Pudding,

or a 
Merry-Andrew,
 shall lead from
one end of the Town to the other.
'Tis an 
Old Man,
 who shews his Dot∣age
by Murmuring without knowing
what he would have, and whose
Mouth we cannot stop, when he has
once began to Talk.


I should never have done, were I
minded to set down all the Contrarie∣ties
that are to be found in the 
Pub∣lick,

since it possesses all the 
Vertues,

and all the 
Vices,
 all the 
Forces,
 and
all the 
Infirmities
 of Mankind.


Let us reassume our Gravity to con∣sider
the Real 
Grandeur
 of the 
Publick.

'Tis out of it we see every thing pro∣ceeds,
which is of any Consideration
in the World: 
Governors
 to Rule Pro∣vinces,

Iudges
 to Regulate them,

Warriers
 to Fight, and 
Heroes
 to Con∣quer.
After these Governors, these
Judges, these Warriers, and these He∣roes,
have Gloriously signaliz'd them∣selves
in all Parts, they all come to
meet again at Court; where Interpi∣dity
it self 
Trembles,
 Fierceness is



Softned;
 Gravity 
Rectified,
 and Power

Disappears.


There those that are distinguish'd in
other Places, like so many Sovereigns;
among the Crowd of Courtiers, be∣come
Courtiers themselves; and after
they have drawn the Eyes of so ma∣ny
Thousands after them, think it
their Glory to be look'd upon by 
One

from whom those Illustrious 
Stars
 de∣rive
their Splendour, and are never so
near their 
Meridian,
 as when the

Monarch,
 that Spring of Glory, shines
upon them, and Communicates
some Beams of his Magnificence to
them.


As his very 
Looks
 raise the Merit of
the greatest Actions, every one is Jea∣lous
of him who endeavours to at∣tract
them to himself; but for all that,
they are so Complaisant, that they
don't neglect to 
Caress
 the Man of
whom they are Jealous.


However, there are some 
Elevated
Souls
 that have infinitely rais'd them∣selves
about those 
Court Infirmities.

Real 
Heroes
 and 
Brave
 Men indeed!
Who are no more grieved at the 
Glory

of others, than to share the Light of
the 
Sun
 in Common with them.



I own indeed, says my 
Indian,
 in
taking his leave of me, that 
England

produces some of these perfect 
En∣glishmen,

whose Reputations have
reached our Parts of the World; but
it was to see something Greater than
this, that I undertook this Voyage;
and consider how I reason'd with my
self as I pass'd the Ocean. 
England

abounds with 
Illustrious Men,
 and tho'
there may be Animosities among
them; yet they all unanimously now
agree to Reverence and Respect 
the
King alone:
 And must not he be an
Extraordinary Man?


FINIS.
