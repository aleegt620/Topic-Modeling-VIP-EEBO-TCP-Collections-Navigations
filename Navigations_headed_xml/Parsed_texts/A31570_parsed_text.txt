Angliae Notitia,

OR
THE PRESENT
STATE
OF
England:
Together with
DIVERS REFLECTIONS
UPON
The Antient State thereof.


In Magnis voluisse sat est—


In the 
SAVOY,

Printed by 
T. N.
 for 
John Martyn,
 and
are to be sold at the Sign of the 
Bell

without 
Temple-Bar,
 1669.
























To the Reader.


IN this small Treatise the 
Reader

may not reasonably expect to
have his 
Fancy
 much delighted,

(Ornari res ipsa negat, contenta
doceri
)

but only to have his 
Understanding

informed; and therefore the Author
hath industriously avoided all curious

Flowers of Rhetorick,
 and made it his
whole business to feed his Reader with
abundant variety of 
Excellent Fruits.


Here are interspersed some Obser∣vations,
which though already known
to many English men, yet may be un∣known
to most 
Strangers
 and 
Forreign∣ers,

for the information of whom


this Book is 
secondarily
 intended; and
for that end will shortly be translated
into the 
French Tongue;
 whereby
may be extinguisht in some measure
the Thirst which Forreigners general∣ly
have to know the 
Present State of

this 
Considerable Monarchy.


Although the main aim is to inform
all men of the 
Present State
 of this
Kingdom, yet divers 
Reflections
 are
made upon the 
past State
 thereof,
that so by comparing that with the
present, some men may thereby not
only be moved to endeavour the 
Re∣stauration

of what was heretofore
better, and the 
abolition
 of what is
now worse; but also in some measure
may 
fore-see
 without consulting our

Astrologers
 and 
Apocalytick
 men, what
will be the 
future
 state of this Na∣tion:
according to that Excellent Say∣ing,

Qui respicit praeterita & inspicit
praesentia, prospicit etiam & futura.


A good Historian by running back to
Ages past, and by standing still and
viewing the present times, and com∣paring
the one with the other, may then
run forward, and give a Verdict of the
State almost Prophetick.


In the many Reflections upon the
Antient State of 
England,
 frequent
use is made of divers grave Authors,
as of 
Horn
 in his 
Mirror of Justice,

of 
Glanvile, Bracton, Britton, For∣tescue,
Linwood, Stamford, Smith,
Cosens, Camden, Cook, Spelman,
Selden, &c.
 And for the 
present
State,
 Consultation was had with
several eminently learned Persona∣ges
yet living, to the end that the
Reader might receive at least some
satisfaction in every particular, with∣out
the trouble and charges of a
great 
Library.
 And as the Author
doth sometimes use both the 
Words

of the 
Living
 and the 
Writings▪
 of the



Dead,
 without quoting any, to a∣void
Ostentation; so he hopes that
this ingenuous Confession being
made at first, no man will be offend∣ed
though he give no notice when the
Observation is theirs, and when it is
his own; having taken special care
that both in theirs and in his own,
there should be nothing but the

truth:
 so that although the Reader
not perceiving every where by what
Authority divers things are averred,
may be apt to suspect that some things
are 
gratis dicta,
 yet if it shall please him
to make search, he will find that ge∣nerally
they are 
vere & cum authorita∣te
dicta.


However in a Subject so 
multiform

as this, where so many Marks are
aimed at, no wonder if in some the
Author hath not hit the 
White;
 but
wheresoever it was missed, it is not
perhaps much wide there-from; and


if in any thing by 
mis-information
 or

mis-observation
 there be any palpa∣ble
mistake (as 
humanum est errare)

it shall in the next Impression be du∣ly
corrected, if any Reader will be so
cou
teous as to advertise either the
Author, the Printer, or Publisher, by
Letter or otherwise.


Brevity
 and a 
Laconique Stile
 is
aimed at all along, that so there
might be 
Magnum in Parvo,
 that it
might be 
mole minimus,
 though 
Re
magnus;
 that the whole State of

England
 might be seen at once,

, or as in a Map; that
as it will be a necessary Book for all
Englishmen at all times: so every one
might without trouble alwayes carry
it about with him as a 
Companion
 to
consult upon all occasions.

OF
ENGLAND.


ENgland
 the better part of
the best 
Iland
 in the
whole World antiently
with 
Scotland,
 called 
Britain,

and sometimes 
Albion;
 was a∣bout
800 years after the 
Incar∣nation
of Christ
 (by special E∣dict
of King 
Egbert
 descend∣ed
from the 
Angles
 a people of
the 
Lower Saxony)
 named 
An∣gle

or 
Englelond,
 thence by the

French
 called 
Angleterre,
 by
the Germans 
Engeland,
 and by
the 
Inhabitants England.



It is situated between the
Degrees 16 and 21 
Longi∣tude,


 equal with 
Normandy

and 
Britany
 in 
France,
 and be∣tween
50 and 57 Northern 
La∣titude,

equal with 
Flanders,
Zeland, Holland, Lower Saxo∣ny,

and 
Denmark.


The longest day in the most
Northern part is 16 hours 44
minutes, and the shortest 7
hours 16 minutes.


It is in 
length
 386 miles,
 in

breadth
 279, in 
compass
 (by rea∣son
of the many 
Bayes
 and 
Pro∣montories)

about 1300 miles;
in 
shape
 triangular, contains by
computation about 30 
Millions
of Acres,
 about the 
thousandth

part of the 
Globe,
 and 333d part
of the habitable earth, almost


ten times as big as the 
United
Neatherlands,
 five times as big
as the 
Spanish Neatherlands;
 less
than all 
Italy
 by almost one
half, and in comparison of

France
 is as 30 to 82.


The 
Aire
 is far more mild
and temperate (if not more
healthy) than any part of the

Continent
 under the same 
Cli∣mat.


By reason of the warm va∣pours
of the Sea on every side,
and the very often Winds
from the huge Western Sea,
the 
Cold
 in 
Winter
 is less sharp
than in some parts of 
France

and 
Italy,
 though more Sou∣thern.


By reason of the continual
blasts from Sea, the 
Heat
 in

Summer
 is less scorching than


in some parts of the 
Conti∣nent,

that lies more Northern.


As in 
Summer
 the gentle

Winds
 and frequent 
Showres

qualifie all violent 
Heats
 and

Droughts,
 so in 
Winter
 the

Frosts
 do only meliorate the
cultivated Soyle, and the 
Snow

keep warm the tender Plants.


It is blessed with a very fer∣tile
wholsome 
Soyle,
 watered
abundantly with 
Springs
 and

Streams,
 and in divers parts
with great 
Navigable Rivers;

few barren 
Mountains
 or craggy

Rocks,
 but generally gentle
pleasant 
Hills
 and fruitful 
Val∣leys

apt for 
Grain, Corn,
 or

Wood.
 The excellency of the
English 
Soyle
 may be learnt (as

Varro
 advised of 
old)
 from the

Complection
 of the 
Inhabitants▪



who therein excell all other
Nations: or else from the high
value put upon it by the 
Ro∣mans

and the 
Saxons,
 who

ookt upon it as such a precious

pot of ground, that they
thought it worthy to be 
fenced


n like a 
Garden Plot
 with a
mighty 
Wall
 of fourscore miles

n length, 
viz.
 from 
Tinmo
th

on the 
German
 Sea▪ to 
Solwey
Frith
 on the 
Irish
 Sea (whereby
the 
Caledonian Bores
 might be
excluded) and with a monstrous

Dike
 of fourscore and ten miles,

viz.
 from the Mouth of the
River 
Wy
 to that of the River

Dee
 (whereby the 
Cambrobritan
Foxes
 might be kept out; last∣ly,)
the excellency of her 
Soyle

may also be learnt from those
transcendent 
Elogies
 bestowed
on her by Antient and Modern


Writers, calling 
England
 the

Granary of the Western World,

the 
Seat of Ceres, &c.
 That
her 
Valleys
 are like 
Eden,
 her

Hills
 like 
Lebanon,
 her 
Springs

as 
Pisgah,
 and her 
Rivers
 as

Jordan.
 That she is a 
Para∣dise

of 
Pleasure,
 and the 
Gar∣den

of 
God. O fortunata &
omnibus terris beatior Britannia,
te omnibus coeli ac soli ditavit
Natura, tibi nihil inest quod
vitae offendat, tibi nihil deest
quod vita desiderat; ita ut alter
orbis extra orbem poni ad delicias
humani generis videaris.
 O
happy and blessed 
Britanie,
 a∣bove
all other Countries in the
World, 
Nature
 hath enricht
thee with all the blessings of

Heaven
 and 
Earth.
 Nothing
in thee is hurtful to Mankind,
nothing wanting in thee that is


desirable, in so much that thou
seemest another World placed
besides, or without the great
World, meerly for the delight
and pleasure of Mankind.


As it is 
divided
 from the rest
of the World,
 so by reason of
its great abundance of all
things necessary for the life of
Man, it may 
without
 the con∣tribution
of any other part of
the World, more easily subsist
than any of its Neighbouring
Countries.


Terra suis contenta bonis, non
indiga mercis.


First, for
 Food, 
what plenty
every where of
 Sheep, Oxen,
Swine, Fallow Deer, 
and
 Coneys,

what plenty of
 Hens, Ducks,
Geese, Turkeys, Swans, Pea∣cocks,


Phesants, Partridges,
Woodcocks, Snipes, Plovers,
Quailes, Herons, Bustards,
Heath Cocks, 
or
 Grouse Thrushes,

or
 Throstles, Black-birds, Vel∣devers,
Nightingales, Pigeons,

and
 Larks. 
What plenty of

Salmon, Trouts, Carps, Tench,
Lampreys, Pikes, Perches,
Eeles, Crevish, Flounders,
Plaice, Shads, Mullets. 
What
great abundance of
 Herrings,
Pilchards, Oysters, Lobsters,
Crabs, Mackerel, Whitings,
Soles, Smelts, Sprats, Prawnes,
Ruffes, &c. 
What great plen∣ty
of
 Apples, Pears, Plums,

and
 Cherries. 
How doth
 Eng∣land

abound with
 Wheat, Barly,
Pulse, Beans, 
and
 Oates, 
with
excellent
 Butter 
and
 Cheese,

with most sorts of
 Edible Roots

and
 Herbs. 
It wants not
 Red


Deer, Hare, Goats, &c. 
It
wants not
 Wild-Ducks, Wild-Geese,
Puffins, Snipes, God-wits,

and many other kind of
Sea-fowl. It wants not
 Apri∣cocks,
Peaches, Nectarins,
Grapes, Figgs, Melons, Quin∣ces,
&c. Walnuts 
and
 Hasel∣nuts.

Lastly, for
 Drinks, Eng∣land

abounds with
 Beer, Ale,
Sider, Perry, 
and in some pla∣ces
with
 Metheglin.


Now of all these things
there is such a constant conti∣nuance,
by reason of the 
Cle∣mency

of the 
Climat,
 that scarce
the least 
Famine
 which fre∣quenteth
other Countries, hath
been felt in 
England
 these 300
years.


Then for 
Rayment, England

produceth generally not onely
very 
Fine Wooll,
 which makes


our Cloth more 
lasting
 than o∣ther
Countrey Cloth, and better

conditioned
 against 
Wind
 & 
Wea∣ther;

but also such great 
abun∣dance

of Wooll, that not onely
all sorts from the highest to the
lowest are clothed therewith▪
but so much hath been hereto∣fore
transported beyond the
Seas, that in honour of the

English Wooll,
 that brough

heretofore such plenty of Gol

into the Territories of 
Charle

the puissant and bold Duke of
Burgundy
 (where the Staple for
English Wooll was then kept

he instituted that famous 
Milita∣ry
Order
 of the 
Golden Fleece,
 a

this day in highest esteem with
the whole 
House
 of 
Austria▪

This abundance and cheapness
of Wooll in 
England
 proceeds
not onely from the 
goodness
 of


the 
Soyle,
 but also from the

freedom
 from 
Wolves
 and tem∣perateness
of 
Heat
 and 
Cold,

which in other Countries cre∣ates
a great charge of a constant
guarding their Sheep, and hou∣sing
them by Night, and some∣times
by Day. Also for ad∣vancing
the Manufacture of
Cloth, that necessary Earth
called 
Fullers Earth,
 is no
where else produced in that a∣bundance
and excellency as in

England.
 Beside, there is in

England
 great plenty of excel∣lent

Leather
 for all sorts of uses,
nor wants it 
Hemp
 and 
Flax,
 at
least not ground fit to produce
them.


For
 Building 
it wants not

Timber 
nor
 Iron, Stone 
nor

Slate, Brick 
nor
 Tiles, Marble

nor
 Alablaster, Mortar 
nor
 Lime,
&c. Lead 
nor
 Glass.



For 
Firing,
 either 
Wood,
Sea-Coal,
 or 
Pit-Coal,
 almost e∣very
where to be had at reason∣able
rates.


For 
Shipping,
 no where bet∣ter

Oak,
 no where such 
Knee
Timber,
 as they call it or 
Iron

to make serviceable and durable

Guns.


For 
War,
 for 
Coach,
 for

Highway,
 and 
Hunting,
 no
where such plenty of 
Horses;

also for 
Plow, Cart,
 and 
Carri∣ages:

insomuch as 
Mules
 and

Asses
 so generally made use
of in 
France, Italy,
 and 
Spain,

are utterly despised in 
Eng∣land.


Moreover, 
England
 produ∣ceth
besides a mighty quantity
of 
Tinne, Lead,
 and 
Iron,
 some

Brass, Copperas, Allome, Salt, Saf∣fron,

and divers other beneficial


Commodities; it wants not

Mines
 of 
Silver,
 yielding more
in their small quantities of 
Ore,

and so richer than those of 
Po∣
osi

in the 
West Indies,
 whence
the 
King
 of 
Spain
 hath most of
his 
Silver;
 those yielding usu∣ally
but one 
Ounce
 and a half of
Silver in one hundred 
Ounces
 of

Ore:
 whereas these in 
Wales,
Cornwall, Lancashire,
 and the

Bishoprick
 of 
Durham,
 yield or∣dinarily
6 or 8 
Ounces per Cent.


ut these lying deep, are hard

o come unto, and Workmen

ear, which is otherwise in 
Po∣
osi.


Vineyards
 have been hereto∣
ore
common in most of the

outhern and Middle Parts of

England,
 and 
Silks
 might be

ere produced, as it was once

esigned by King 
James;
 but


a great part of the Natives
prone to 
Navigation,
 supply∣ing

England
 at a very cheap
rate with all sorts of 
Wine,
Silks,
 and all other Forreign
Commodities, it hath been
found far better 
Husbandry
 to
employ English Ground rather
for producing 
Wooll, Corn,
 and

Cattle,
 for which it is most pro∣per.
In a word, though some
Countries excel 
England
 in some
things, yet in general there is
no one Countrey under Hea∣ven
whose 
Aire
 is better stored
with 
Birds
 and 
Fowls, Seas

and 
Rivers
 with 
Fishes, Fields

with all sorts of 
orn,
 the 
Pa∣stures

with 
Cattel,
 the 
Forests,
Parks,
 and 
Woods
 with 
Wild
Beasts,
 onely for Recreation
and Food; the 
Mines
 with

Metals, Coals,
 and other 
Mi∣nerals;



where are fewer 
rave∣nous

and 
hurtful Beasts,
 fewer

venemous Serpents
 or 
noisome
Flies;
 fewer 
Droughts, Inun∣dations,

or 
Dearths;
 fewer 
Un∣wholsom
Serenes, Pestilential
Aires, Tempestuous Hurricanes,

or 
Destructive Earthquakes;
 last∣ly,
where there is a greater a∣bundance
of all things necessa∣ry
for mans life, and more espe∣cially
for all kind of Food; in∣somuch
that it hath been judg∣ed
that there is yearly as much

Flesh
 and 
Beer
 consumed in

England
 by over plentiful Ta∣bles,
as would well serve three
times the number of People.
Add to all this, that being en∣compassed
with the Sea and
well furnisht with Ships and a∣bundance
of Commodious and
excellent Havens and Ports, it


excels for 
safety
 and 
security

(which is no small praise) all
the Neighbouring Countries,
if not all the Countries in the
World.


It hath been possest by 
five

several Nations,
 and coveted
by many more, and no wonder
so 
fair
 and 
rich
 a 
Lady
 should
have many 
Lovers,
 it being a
Countrey (as was said of the
Tree in the midst of 
Paradise)
good for food, pleasant to the
eyes, and to be desired;
 where∣as

Scotland, Wales, Biscay,
Switzerland,
 and other like
Countries, continue still in the
possession of their 
Aborigines,

of the first that laid claim unto
them, none since judging it
worth their pains to dispossesse
them.



The first Inhabitants of

England
 are believed to be the

Britains,
 descended from the

auls,
 subdued afterward by

he 
Romans;
 who by reason of

eir troubles nearer home,

ere constrained to abandon this
Countrey about 400 years af∣
er

Christ:
 whereupon the 
Picts


ahabitants of 
Scotland,
 inva∣
ng
the 
Britains,
 they call to

eir aid the 
Saxons;
 who cha∣
ng
away the 
Picts,
 soon made
themselves Masters of the 
Bri∣tains:

but these not able to en∣
ure
the heavy yoke of the

axons,
 after many Battels and
Attempts to recover their lost
Liberties and Countrey, retired

r were driven most of them

nto the two utmost 
Western

arren,
 and 
mountainous
 parts
of this Countrey, called af∣terwards


by the 
Saxons Wa∣lishland,

instead of 
Gaulishland,

as the 
Germans
 still call 
Italy
Walishland,
 because inhabited
by the 
Cisalpine Gauls;
 and the
French call our Countrey of

Britains, Le Pais de Gales.


The 
Saxons
 solely possest of
all the best part of this 
Isle▪

were for a long time infested,
and for some time almost sub∣dued
by the 
Danes,
 and after∣wards
wholly by the 
Normans,

who drave not out the 
Saxons,

but mixed with them; so that
the 
English blood
 at this day is
a 
mixture
 chiefly of 
Norma

and 
Saxon,
 not without 


tincture
 of 
Danish, Romish,
 and

Britain
 Blood.


The 
English Tongue
 being a

present much refined,
 exceed∣ingly


copious, expressive, and
significant (by reason of a liber∣ty
taken by the Natives of
borrowing out of all other Lan∣guages,
whatever might con∣duce
thereunto) is (as their
blood) a 
mixture
 chiefly of the
Old 
Saxon
 (a 
Dialect
 of the

Teutonick)
 and the Old 
Norman

(a 
Dialect
 of the 
French)
 not
without some savour of the

Britains, Romans,
 and 
Danes
Languages.


The 
Romans
 possessing 
Eng∣land,

caused their Tongue the

Latine
 once to be generally u∣sed
in this Countrey.


The 
Saxons
 succeeding, in∣troduced
their 
Language
 where∣soever
they seated themselves.


The 
Normans
 afterwards
getting possession of 
England,

caused the Norman or French


Tongue to be learnt at School
by the 
Saxons,
 and for a
long time had all 
Lawes,
Pleadings, Sermons, &c.
 in

French.


The 
Latine
 Tongue at pre∣sent
is made use of in 
Court
Rolls, Processes of Courts,
 in

Charters, Commissions, Patents,
Writs, Bonds, &c.


The Names of all 
Shires,
Cities, Towns,
 and 
Villages, Pla∣ces

and 
Men,
 in 
England,
 are
generally 
Saxon,
 and so are
most 
Nouns Appellative,
 and a
great part of the 
Verbs.


In 
French,
 or rather 
Norman,

are still written the 
Common
Laws,
 and learnt by young
Students thereof. Also some

Pleadings,
 and all 
Mootes
 and

Law Exercises,
 are wholly

French.
 In 
Parliaments
 the


King doth in French signifie his
assent or dissent to all Bills.


The 
Natives
 of 
England
 (by
reason of the 
Temperate Climat,


Mild Aire,
 not rendred unequal
by high 
Mountains,
 nor un∣healthy
by many 
Marshes,
 plen∣ty
of wholsome food, and the
use of Beer rather than Wine)

pour la belle taille & le beau
teinct au visage,
 as the French
say, for a just handsome large

proportion
 of body, for clear

complexions
 and pleasing 
fea∣tures,

do surpasse all the Nati∣ons
of the World.


The English are generally
great 
Flesh-eaters,
 although
by the nearness of the 
Sea
 and
abundance of 
Rivers
 and 
Fish-ponds,

there is no want of Fish.


In former times their Table was
in many places covered four
times a day, they had 
Break∣fasts,
Dinners, Beverages,
 and

Suppers,
 and every where 
set
Dinners
 and 
Suppers:
 until in
the late troubles, wherein ma∣ny
eminent families were much
impoverisht, a Custom was ta∣ken
up by some of the Nobility
and Gentry, of eating a more
plentiful 
Dinner,
 but little or no

Supper;
 as on the contrary the

Romans
 and 
Jews
 anciently,
and the 
hotter Climats,
 at this
day have little or no 
Dinners,

but 
set Suppers.


The English are not now so
much addicted to 
Gluttony
 and
Drunkenness as heretofore,
nor unto 
Tobacco,
 which per∣haps
within a few years may be
expelled by 
Coffee.




Feasting
 also is not now so

ommon and profuse as anti∣
ntly,
for although the 
Feasts


t 
Coronations,
 at the 
Installa∣tions

of 
Knights
 of the 
Garter,

onsecrations
 of 
Bishops, En∣tertainments

of 
Ambassadors,


he Feasts of the 
Lord Mayor
 of

London,
 the 
Sergeants at Law,


nd 
Readers Feasts
 in the 
Innes
of Court,
 are all very 
sumptuous


nd 
magnificent
 in these times;

et compared to the Feasts of

ur 
Ancestors,
 seem to be but

iggardly and sparing: for 
Ri∣chard
Earl of Cornwall,
 Brother

o 
Henry
 3, had at his Marri∣
ge
Feast, as is recorded, Thir∣
y
thousand Dishes of Meat;

nd King 
Richard
 the 2d. at a

Christmass
 spent daily 26 Oxen,

oo Sheep, besides Fowl and

ll other Provision proportion∣ably;


so antiently at a 
Call 

Sergeants,
 each 
Sergeant
 (sait


Fortescue)
 spent sixteen hun∣dred
Crowns, which in thos

dayes was more than 1600

now.


The English that feed not o∣ver
liberally (whereto the gre

plenty and variety of Vian

entice them) nor drink muc


Wine,
 but content themselv

with Small 
Ale
 or 
Sider
 (b

especially the later) are obser∣ved
to be much more 
health

and far 
longer lived
 than any 

our Neighbour Nations.


For 
Apparel
 or 
Clothing
 the

French Mode
 hath been gen
∣rally
used in 
England
 of la

years.
 In the time of Queen

Elizabeth
 sometimes the 
Hi

Dutch,
 sometimes the 
Spanis



and sometimes the 
Turkish
 and

Morisco Habits,
 were by the

English
 worn in 
England
 when
the Women wore 
Doublets

with 
Pendant Codpieces
 on the
Breast full of 
Tags
 and 
Cuts;

moreover 
Gallygascons, Far∣dingales,

and 
Stockings
 of 
di∣vers
Colours:
 but since the
Restauration of the King now
raigning, 
England
 never saw,
for matter of wearing 
Apparel,

less prodigality and more mo∣desty
in Clothes, more plain∣ness
and comeliness than a∣mongst
her Nobility, Gentry,
and Superiour Clergy; onely

he Citizens, the Countrey
People, and the Servants, ap∣pear
clothed for the most part
above and beyond their Quali∣ties,
Estates, or Conditions.
Since our late breach with



France,
 the English Men
(though not the Women)
have quitted the French Mode,
and taken a grave Wear, much
according with the Oriental
Nations.


Churches
 thorowout all 
Eng∣land

and all 
Publick Edifices,

are generally of 
Solid Stone,

covered with 
Lead, Cathedral

and 
Collegiate Churches
 every
where ample and magnificent;
and the Churches in Market
Towns and Opulent Villages
spatious and solid enough▪
Houses in Cities that were
heretofore usually of 
Wood▪

are now built of good 
Stone
 o


Brick,
 and covered with 
Slat

or 
Tile;
 the Rooms within
formerly 
wainscotted,
 are now

hung with Tapistry
 or other con∣venient


Stuffe, and all 
cieled

with 
Plaister,
 excellent against
the rage of Fire, against the
Cold and Sluttishness.


The Modern Buildings have
been far more slight and of less
continuance than the Antient.


The Houses of the Nobles
and Rich, are abundantly fur∣nisht
with 
Pewter, Brass, Fine
Linnen,
 and 
Plate.
 The mean
Mechanicks and ordinary Hus∣bandmen,
want not 
Silver

poons,
 or some 
Silver Plate,
 in

heir Houses.


The 
Windowes
 every where

lased,
 not made of 
Paper
 or

Wood,
 as is usual in 
Italy
 and

pain.


Chimnies
 in most places, no

toves,
 although the far more

outhern parts of 
Germany
 can

ardly subsist in the Winter

ithout them.




England
 contains 9725 Pa∣rishes,

 now allowing to each
Parish one with another 80
Families, there will be 778000
Families, and to each Family
7 persons, there will be found
in all Five Millions four hun∣dred
forty six thousand souls,
and amongst them about one
Million of Fighting Men.


As some years before the late
Troubles no people of any
Kingdom in the World enjoy∣ed
more freedom from 
Slavery

and 
Taxes,
 so generally none
were freer from evil tempers
and humours: none more 
de∣voutly
religious, willingly obedi∣ent
to the Laws, truly loyal to
the King, lovingly hospitable to
Neighbours, ambitiosly civil to


Strangers,
 or more 
liberally cha∣ritable
to the Needy.


No Kingdom could shew a
more 
knowing prudent Nobility,

a more 
valiant Gentry,
 a more

learned
 and 
pious Clergy,
 or
a more 
contented loyal Commo∣nalty.


The
 Men 
were generall ho∣nest,
the
 Wives 
and
 Women

chast and modest,
 Parents lo∣ving,
Children obedient, Hus∣bands
kind, Masters gentle, 
and

Servants faithful.


In a word, the 
English
 were
then according to their 
Native
Temper,
 the best 
Neighbors,

best 
Friends,
 best 
Subjects,

and the best 
Christians
 in the
World.


Amongst these excellent

Tempers,
 amongst this goodly

Wheat,
 whilst men slept, the


Enemy came and sowed 
Tares,

there sprang up of later years a
sort of people 
sowre, reserved,
narrow-hearted, close-fisted,
self-conceited, ignorant, stiff-necked,
Children of Belial
 (ac∣cording
to the genuine signifi∣cation
of the 
word)
 ever prone
to 
despise Dominion,
 to 
speak
evil of Dignities,
 to 
gain-say
Order, Rule,
 and 
Authority;

who have accounted it their
honour to contend with 
Kings

and 
Governours,
 and to 
disquiet

the Peace of 
Kingdoms;
 whom
no 
deserts
 nor 
clemency
 could
ever oblige, neither 
Oaths
 or

Promises
 bind, breathing no∣thing
but 
sedition
 and 
calum∣nies

against the Establisht Go∣vernment,

aspiring
 without
measure, 
railing
 without rea∣son,
and making their own 
wild


fancies
 the square & rule of their

consciences;
 hating, despising, or
disrespecting the 
Nobility, Gen∣try,

and 
Superiour Clergy, &c.


These lurking in all quarters
of 
England,
 have at length
with their pestilential breath in∣fected
some of the 
worse natu∣red

and 
worse nurtured Gentry,

divers of the 
inferiour Clergy,

most of the 
Tradesmen
 and ve∣ry
many of the 
Peasantry,
 and
prevailed so far, as not onely to
spoil the best governed State,
and ruine the purest and most
flourishing Church in 
Christen∣dome,

but also to corrupt the

minds,
 the 
humours,
 and very

natures
 of so many English;
insomuch that notwithstanding
the late happy restauration of
the 
King
 and 
Bishops,
 the inces∣sant
joynt endeavours and stu∣dies


of all our Governours to
reduce this people to their 
pri∣stine

happiness, yet no man
now living can reasonably hope
to see in his time the like bles∣sed
dayes again; without a
transplantation of all those sons
of 
Belial
 (as King 
James
 in his
grave Testament to his Son did
intimate) without an utter ex∣tirpation
of those Tares, which
yet the Clemency and Meek∣ness
of the Protestant Religion
seems to forbid.


The 
Nobility
 and chief 
Gentry

of 
England
 have been even by
Strangers compared to the 
finest
Flowre,
 but the lower sort of
common People to the 
coursest
bran;
 the innate good nature,
joyned with the liberal educati∣on
and converse with Strangers
in forreign Countries, render


those exceeding civil; whereas

he wealth, insolence, and pride

f these, and the rare converse

ith strangers, have rendred

hem so distastful, not onely to

he few strangers who frequent

England,
 but even to their own
Gentry, that they could some∣times
wish that either the
Countrey were less plentiful, or

hat the Impositions were hea∣
ier,
for by reason of the great
abundance of 
Flesh
 and 
Fish,
Corn, Leather, Wooll, &c.
 which
the Soil of its own bounty,
with little labour doth produce.
The 
Yeomanry
 at their ease and
almost forgetting labour, grow
rich, and thereby so proud, in∣solent,
and careless, that they
neither give that humble re∣spect
and awful reverence which
in other Kingdomes is usually


given to 
Nobility, Gentry,
 and

Clergy,
 nor are they so 
in∣dustrious

or so 
skillful
 in 
Manu∣factures

as some of our Neigh∣bour
Nations; so that in 
Eng∣land

it is no 
Paradox
 to affirm▪
that as too much 
indigency
 in
the inferiour sort of people
doth 
depress
 the spirits and 
dul

the minds of them, so too

plentiful
 and 
wanton
 a fortune,
causeth in them a 
lazyness▪
 and

less industry,
 that state com∣monly
enjoying most 
peace

and 
order
 and 
happiness,
 where
either the 
moderate barrenness

of the Countrey, or 
want
 of

ground,
 or 
multitude
 of 
Im∣posts

(as in 
Holland)
 do ne∣cessitate
the common people to
be industrious in their Callings,
and so to mind their own, as
not to disturb the State and
Church Affairs.



Moreover, of the 
English

especially it hath been observ∣ed,
that then it is 
happiest
 with
them, when they are some∣what

pressed,
 and in a 
complain∣ing

condition, according to
that old Riming Verse,

Anglica gens est optima flens
& pessima gaudens.


The 
English
 Nation ancient∣ly
were and at this day are very
apt to hearken to 
Prophesies,

and to create 
Prodigies;
 and
then interpret them according
to their own extravagant con∣ceits;
to invent and then main∣tain
any the most prodigious
Opinions and Tenents in Phi∣losopy
of Divinity; some of
the inferiour sort of late holding
abominable opinions, unworthy


even of men, and such as in no
Age were ever broacht before.


The 
English National Vices

were antiently 
Gluttony
 and the
effects thereof 
Lasciviousness,

(when they made four Meals in
a day and most excessive 
Feast∣ing,

with great plenty of 
French
Wine)
 when Women of 
pro∣fessed
Incontinency
 were permit∣ted
to proffer their Bodies to all
Comers, in certain places called

Stews
 or 
Stoves,
 or 
Bathing
places;
 because men were wont
to 
bath
 themselves there (as
still in other Countries) before
they addrest themselves to 
ve∣nereous
acts.
 Moreover 
Pride
in Apparel,
 wherein they were
anciently so extravagant and
foolish, that divers 
Statutes
 and

Homilies
 have been made a∣gainst
that Excess, and an


English Man was wont to be pi∣ctured
naked with a pair of 
Tay∣lors
Sheers
 in his hand, and a
piece of Cloth under his arme,
with Verses annext, intimating
that he knew not what fashion
of Clothes to have.


Excess of drinking
 was anci∣ently
more rare in 
England,

as appears by an old Poet,

Ecce Britannorum mos est
laudabilis iste,


Vt bibat arbitrio pocula
quisque suo.


The Danes in the time of
King 
Edgar
 first brought it in,
but it was afterward banisht

ence, so that we find no anci∣ent
Statute against it; for
though the Statutes heretofore

ade against Excess in 
Apparel



and 
Dyet
 are ancient, yet
those against 
Drunkenness
 are
but of late date.


As the English returning
from the Wars in the 
Holy
Land,
 brought home the foul
disease of 
Leprosie,
 now almost
extinct here, though not yet in
our neighbouring Countries;
so in our Fathers dayes the 
En∣glish

returning from the Service
in the 
Netherlands,
 brought
with them the foul Vice of

Drunkenness,
 as besides other
Testimonies, the Term of 
Ca∣rous,

from 
Gar ausz, All out,

learnt of the 
High-Dutch
 there
in the same Service; so 
Quaffe,
&c.
 This Vice of late was
more, though at present too
much; insomuch that some
persons, and those of quality,
may not safety be visited in an


Afternoon, without running
the hazard of Excessive drink∣ing
of 
Healths
 (whereby in a
short time twice as much liquor
is consumed as by the 
Dutch,

who sip and prate) and in some
places it is esteemed a piece of
wit to make a man drunk, for
which purpose some 
swilling in∣sipid
Trencher Buffoon
 is alwayes
at hand.


However it may be truly af∣firmed
that at present there is
generally less Excess in 
Drink∣ing

(especially about 
London

since the use of 
Coffee)
 less ex∣cess
in 
Dyet,
 but principally in

Apparel
 than heretofore: inso∣much
that the poor Tradesman
is much pincht thereby; for as
it is expedient for the benefit
of the whole Commonwealth,
that divers 
unnecessary
 and 
su∣perfluous



Commodities should
be allowed, as 
'Tobacco, Coffee,
Spices, Sugars, Raisins, Silks,
&c.
 so some less hurtful ex∣cesses
(as in 
Apparel, Dyet,
Building, Coaches, Lackeys,
&c.
 must either be connived
at, or much of all the money
of the Nation must lie dead and
unemploied (as it now doth in
the 
private, sullen, niggardly
Non-Conformists
 hands) and
Tradesmen must either starve,
or be sustained by Almes.


The Sin of 
Buggery
 brought
into 
England
 by the 
Lombards,

as appears not only by the word

Bugeria,
 but also by 
Rot. Parl.
50. Edw. 3. N.
 58. is now
rarely practised amongst En∣glish,
although sometimes dis∣covered
amongst 
Aliens
 in 
En∣gland,

and then punisht by


Death without any remission.


Impoysonments,
 so ordinary

 
Italy,
 is so abominable a∣mongst
English, as 21 
H.
 8.

 was made High Treason,

hough since repealed; after
which the punishment for it was

 be put alive in a Caldron of
Water and there boiled to

eath.


Stabbing
 in 
England
 is much

ore seldome than in 
Italy,


e English being easie to be re∣
onciled
to pardon and remit

ffences, not apt to seek re∣
enge;
the true well-bred En∣
lish
have more of inclination

 goodness, which the Greeks

alled 
Philanthropia,
 than other
Nations; the Nobility and well-
red
Gentry delighting to be

racious and courteous to
Strangers, compassionate to the


afflicted, and grateful to Benefa∣ctors,
when their Purse or Esta

not diverted by other extrava∣gant
expences, will give the

leave to remember them.


The English according to the

Climat,
 are of a 
middle temp

The 
Northern Saturnine
 a

the 
Southern Mercurial temp

meeting in their Constitution
render them 
ingenious
 and 
a∣ctive,

yet 
solid
 and 
perseve
∣ring,

which nourisht under
sutable liberty, inspires a cou∣rage

generous
 and 
lasting.


Their 
Ingenuity
 will not al∣low
them to be excellent 

the 
Cheat,
 but subject in tha

point rather to take tha

give, and supposing others 

open-hearted as themselves
are many times in Trespass o∣vermatcht
by them, whom


they overmatch in 
Arms
 and

ue Valour.


The English since the Refor∣mation
so much given to Lite∣rature,
that all sorts are gene∣rally
the most knowing people

 the world. They have been

 much addicted to writing, and

specially in their own lan∣guage,
and with so much li∣cence
or connivence, that ac∣cording
to the observation of a

earned Man, there have

een since the Reformation

more good
 and 
more bad Books

printed and published in the En∣glish
Tongue, than in all the
Vulgar Languages of 
Europe.


For solidity of matter, for

legancy of style in their 
Ser∣mons,
Comedies, Romances,
 as
also in their Books of 
Philoso∣phy,
Physick, History,
 and all


other solid Learning, no Nati∣on
hath surpassed the English
and few equalled them.


The English, especially the

Gentry,
 are so much given 


Prodigality
 and 
Slothfulness

that Estates are oftner 
spent
 an


sold
 than in any other Countrey
They think it a piece of frug
∣lity
beneath a Gentleman 


bargain
 before hand, or to 
cou

afterward, for what they eat 

any place, though the rate 

most 
unreasonable;
 whereby 

comes to passe that 
Cooks, Vint∣ners,
Inn-keepers,
 and such
mean fellows, enrich them∣selves,
and begger and in 

over the Gentry. In a word▪
by 
their prodigality
 it comes to
pass, that not only those, but

Taylors, Dancing-Masters,
 and
such 
Trifling Fellows,
 arrive to


that riches and pride as to ride

 their 
Coaches,
 keep their

mmer Houses, to be served

 Plate, 
&c.
 an insolence insup∣ortable
in other well governed
Nations.


For variety of 
Divertise∣ments,


 
Sports
 and 
Recreations,


o Nation doth excell the En∣glish.


The King hath his
 Forests,

hases, 
and
 Parks, 
full of va∣riety
of Game; hunting

and
 Fallow Deer, Foxes, Ot∣hers,
Hawking, 
his
 Paddock Courses,
Horse Races, &c.

broad; and at home
 Tennis,
Baloon, Biliards, Comedies,
Masks, &c. 
The Nobility and
chief Gentry have their
 Parks,
Warrens, Decoyes, Paddock-Courses,
Horse Races, Hunting,


Coursing, Fishing, Fowling
Hawking, Setting Dogs, Tumblers
Lurchers, Duck-hunting, Cock

Tables, Chesse, Draughts
Cards, Dice, Catches, Questi∣ons,
Purposes, Comedies, Dan∣cing,
Singing, 
all sorts of
 Mu∣sical
Instruments, &c. 
The Ci∣tizens
and Peasants have
 Hand-Ball,
Foot-Ball, Skitles, 

Nine Pins, Shovel-board, Sto
-Ball,
Goffe, Trol Madam, Cua∣gels,
Bear-baiting, Bull-bait∣ing,
Bow 
and
 Arrow, Throwing
at Cocks, Shuttle-cock, Bowling,
Quaits, Leaping, Wrestling▪
Pitching the Barre, 
and
 Ringing
of Bells, 
a Recreation used in
no other Countrey of the
World.


Amongst these 
Cock-fighting

may seem too 
childish
 and 
un∣suitable



for the 
Gentry,
 and

 the Common People 
Bull∣
iting

and 
Bear-baiting
 may

em too 
cruel,
 and for the

Foot-ball
 very 
uncivil


 
rude.


For 
Weights
 and 
Measures
 at

esent used in 
England,
 there

ve been very many excellent

atutes and Ordinances, and

undance of care taken by our

ncestors to prevent all cheat∣ing
and deceit therein.


By the 27th Chapter of

agna Charta
 the 
Weights
 and

easures
 ought to be the same
yet all 
England,
 and those to

 according to the 
Kings

andards
 of 
Weights
 and 
Mea∣
res

kept by a special 
Officer


 his 
House,
 called the 
Clerk

 Comptroller
 of the 
Market.



Of 
Weights
 there are two
sorts used at present thorow∣out
all 
England, viz. Troy
Weight
 and 
Avoirdupois.
 In

Troy
 weight 24 grains of
Wheat make a 
Penny weight
Sterling,
 20 Penny weight
make an 
Ounce,
 12 Ounces
make a 
Pound;
 so there are
480 Grains in the Ounce, and
5760 Grains in the Pound.


By this Weight are weighed

Pearls, Pretious Stones, Gold,
Silver, Bread,
 and all manner
of 
Corn
 and 
Grain;
 and this
Weight the 
Apothecaries
 do
or ought to use, though by o∣ther
divisions and denomina∣tions:
their least Measure is a

Grain.






20 Grains make a Scruple markt ℈


3 Scruples make a Drach. markt ʒ


8 Drachmes make an Ounce, markt ℥


12 Ounces make a Pound, markt lb




Avoir du pois
 hath 16 Oun∣ces
to the Pound, but then
the Ounce 
Avoir du pois
 is
lighter than the Ounce 
Troy
 by
42 Grains in 480, that is neer
a 12th part; so that the 
Avoir
du pois
 Ounce containeth but
438 Grains, and is as 73 to 80,
that is 73 Ounces 
Troy
 is as
much as 80 Ounces 
Avoirdu∣pois,

and 60 Pound 
Avoirdu∣pois

is equal to 73 Pounds 
Troy,

and 14 Ounces 
Troy
 and a half,
and the 10th part of a 
Troy

Ounce make 16 Ounces 
A∣voirdupois.


By this Weight are weighed


in 
England
 all 
Grocery Wares,
Flesh, Butter, Cheese, Iron,
Hemp, Flax, Tallow, Wax,
Wooll, Lead, Steel,
 also all
things whereof comes waste,
and therefore 112 
l. Avoirdu∣pois

is called a hundred weight,
and 56 
l.
 half a hundred, and
28 
l.
 a quarter of a hundred, o

a Tod. Eight Pounds 
Avoir∣dupois

amongst the Butchers is
called a Stone.


Note that when 
Wheat
 is at
5 
s.
 the 
Bushel,
 then the 
Penny
Wheaten Loaf
 is by Statute to
weight 11 Ounces 
Troy,
 and 


Half penny White Loaves
 to
weigh as much, and the 
Hou∣shold
Penny Loaf
 to weigh 1


Troy
 Ounces and two third part
of an Ounce, and so more 

less proportionably.



All 
Measures
 in 
England
 are
either 
Applicative
 or 
Recep∣tive.


The smallest 
Mensura appli∣cationis

or 
applicative
 measure

s a 
Barly Corn,
 whereof 3 in
length make a fingers breadth
or 
Inch, 4 Inches
 make a 
Hand∣ful,
3 Handful
 a 
Foot, 1 Foot

and a half makes a 
Cubit, 2 Cu∣bits

a 
Yard, 1 Yard
 and a quar∣ter
makes an 
Ell,
 5 Foot make

Geometrical Pace,
 6 Foot a

athom,
 16 Foot and a half
make a 
Perch, Pole,
 or 
Rod,


 
Perch
 make a 
Furlong, 8

urlongs,
 or 320 
Perch
 make

English Mile,
 which accord∣ing
to the Statute of 11 
H.
 7.

ight to be 1760 Yards, or

80 Foot, that is 280 Foot
more than the 
Italian Mile;



60 Miles, or more exactly 69
English Miles and a half, make
a 
Degree,
 and 360 
Degrees
 or
25020 Miles compass the whole

Globe
 of the 
Earth.


For measuring of Land in

England,
 40 Perch in length
and 4 in breadth make an 
Acre

of Land (so called from the

German
 word 
Acker,
 and tha

from the Latine 
Ager)
 3

Acres ordinar
ly make a 
Yar

Land,
 and one hundred Acre
are accounted a 
Hide of Land

but in this and also in som

Weights and other Measures

the Custome of the place is o∣therwise,
yet must be re∣garded.


Mensurae Receptionis,
 or th


Receptive
 Measures, are tw

fold; first of 
Liquid
 or 
Mo

things, secondly of 
Dry
 things▪


About a pound 
Avoir dupois

makes the ordinary smallest 
re∣ceptive

measure called a 
Pint,
2 Pints
 make a 
Quart, 2
Quarts
 a 
Pottle, 2 Pottles
 a

Gallon, 8 Gallons
 a 
Firkin of
Ale, 9 Gallons
 a 
Firkin of
Beer,
 2 such 
Firkins
 or 18 
Gal∣lons

make a 
Kilderkin, 2 Kil∣derkins

or 36 Gallons make a

Barrel
 of Beer, 2 
Barrels
 a

Hogshead, 2 Hogsheads
 a 
Pipe
 or

Butt, 2 Pipes
 a 
Tun,
 consist∣ing
of 2300 Pints or Pounds.


A Barrel of Butter or Soap is
the same with a Barrel of Ale.


The English 
Wine
 Measures
are smaller than those of 
Ale

and 
Beer,
 and hold proportion
as 4 to 5; so that 4 Gallons of

Beer
 Measure are 5 Gallons of

Wine
 Measure, and each Gal∣lon
of Wine is 8 pounds 
Troy



Weight. Of these Gallons, a

Rundlet
 of Wine holds 18, a

Tierce
 of Wine holds 42 Gal∣lons,
a 
Hogshead
 63 Gallons, a

Pipe
 or 
Butt
 holds 126, and a
Tun 252 Gallons or 2016
Pints.


To measure dry things as

Corn
 or 
Grain,
 there is first
the Gallon which is bigger
than the 
Wine
 Gallon and less
then the 
Ale
 or 
Beer
 Gallon,
and is in proportion to them as
33 to 28 and 35, and is
counted 8 pounds 
Troy
 weight.
Two of these Gallons make a

Peck, 4 Pecks
 a 
Bushel, 4 Bu∣shels

the 
Comb
 or 
Curnock, 2
Curnocks
 make a 
Quarter;
 and
10 Quarters a 
Last
 or 
Weigh,

which contains 5120 Pints, and
about so many pounds; so that in
a Garrison of 5000 men, allow∣ing


each but a pound of bread

per diem,
 they will consume
neer a 
Last
 or 80 Bushels every
day, and 250 Men in a Ship of
War will drink a 
Tun
 of 
Beer

in 2 dayes, allowing each man
but his 
Pottle per diem.


At first all Nations bartered
and exchanged one commodity
for another,
 but that being
found troublesome, by a kind of
Custom, good liking, or usage,
amongst all Civilized Nations,

Silver
 and 
Gold
 as most 
porta∣ble,
pliable, beautiful,
 and less
subject to rust, hath been as
early as the dayes of 
Abraham,

chosen to be the Instruments
of 
Exchange
 and measure of
all things, and were at first
paid onely by 
Weight,
 till the
Romans about 300 years be∣fore


the Birth of Christ invent∣ed

Coyning
 or 
Stamping
 Gold
and Silver.


When 
Julius Caesar
 first en∣tred
this 
Iland,
 here were cur∣rent
instead of Money, certain

Iron Rings,
 afterwards the Ro∣mans
brought in the use of 
Gold,
Silver,
 and 
Brass Coyns.


In the time of King 
Richard

the First Moneys coined in the

East
 parts of 
Germany
 being for
its purity highly esteemed,
some of those 
Easterlings
 were
sent for over, and emploied in
our Mint, and thence our Mo∣ney
called 
Esterling
 or 
Sterling

Money, as some think; though
others say of the 
Saxon
 word

Ster, Weighty.


King 
Edward
 the First since
the 
Norman
 Conquest, establish∣ed
a certain 
Standard
 for 
Coyn



in this manner: Twenty four
Grains made one 
Penny Ster∣ling,

20 Penny weight one

Ounce,
 and 12 Ounces made a

Pound Sterling,
 consisting of
20 Shillings. Of these 12
Ounces, 11 Ounces 2 Penny
weight 
Sterling,
 was to be of
pure Silver, called 
Leaf Silver,

and the weight of about 18
Penny 
Sterling
 in allay the

Minter
 might adde: So that
anciently a 
Pound Sterling
 was
a Pound of 
Troy
 weight, where∣as
now a 
Pound Sterling
 is but
the 
third
 part of a 
Pound Troy,

and little more than a 4th part
of 
Avoirdupois weight.


The Money of 
England
 was
abased and falsified for a long
time, till Queen 
Elizabeth
 in
the year 1560, to her great
praise called in all such Money;


since which time no base Mo∣ney
hath been coined in 
Eng∣land,

but onely of pure 
Gold

and 
Silver,
 called 
Sterling
 Mo∣ney;
onely of later times, in
relation to the necessity of the

Poor,
 and Exchange of great
Money, a small piece of 
Brass

called a 
Farthing,
 or fourth
part of a Penny, hath been
permitted to be coined, but
no man enforced to receive
them in pay for Rent or Debt;
which cannot be affirmed of
any other State or Nation in
the Christian World, in all
which there are several sorts of

Copper
 Money as current with
them for any payment as the
purest 
Gold
 or 
Silver.


No Moneys in any Mint are
made of pure 
Silver,
 because

Silver
 in its purity is almost as



flexible
 as 
Lead;
 and therefore
not so useful, as when hardned
with 
Copper.


Gold
 minted pure would also
be too 
flexible,
 and therefore
is in all Mints allaied with some

Copper;
 and most Mints differ
in more or less allay.


The Ordinary Silver Coyns
at present in 
England,
 are ac∣cording
to weight, either the
Ounce 
Troy,
 the half Ounce,
the 5th part, 10th part, 15th
part, 20th part, 30th part, or
60th part; thus denominated,

The Crown, Half Crown, Shil∣ling,
Six Pence, Four Pence,
Three Pence, Two Pence,
 a

Penny.


The 
Standard
 of 
Sterling

Silver in 
England
 is 
Eleven
Ounces
 and 
Two Penny weight

of 
Fine Silver,
 and 18 
Penny


weight
 of 
Allay
 of 
Copper
 out of
the Fire, and so proportiona∣bly;
so that 12 Ounces of pure
Silver, without any allay, is
worth 3 
l. 4 s. 6 d.
 and an
Ounce is worth 5 
s. 4 d. 1 ob.

but with allay is worth but 3 
l.

and the Ounce 5 
s.


The Ordinary English Gold
Coyns are now only the old 
Ca∣rolus,

or 20 
s.
 Piece, which
by a late Proclamation is cur∣rent
at 21 
s. 4 d.
 it weigheth 5
Penny weight 20 Grains. The

New Guinea 20 s.
 weigheth 5
Penny 10 Grains.


The Standard of the 
English
Carolus
 piece, or Ordinary 
Gold,

is in the Pound weight 
Troy
 22

Carrats
 of Fine Gold and 2

Carrats
 of Allay Silver or Cop∣per;
that is, 11 Ounces of
Fine Gold and one Ounce of
Allay Silver or Copper.



The 
Spanish, French,
 and

Flemish
 Gold is of equal fineness
with the English.


The 
English
 Silver Money
hath less Allay than the 
French

or 
Dutch.


The 
Moneyers
 divide the
Pound weight into 12 Ounces

Troy.




The



Ounce


Pen weight


Grain


Mite


Droite


Periot.



into



20 Pen. w.


24 Grains.


20 Mites.


24 Droites


20 Periots.


24 Blanks.










The English Silver is coined
at 3 
l. 2 s.
 the Pound of 
Troy

weight, the 2 
s.
 being allowed
the Minters for Coinage.



The English Gold is coined
at present at 44 
l. 10 s.
 the
Pound 
Troy
 weight, whereof
15 
s.
 is allowed the Minters for
Coinage.


So that now the proportion
of Gold to Silver in 
England,

is as one to 14 and about ⅓ that
is to say. one Ounce of Gold is
worth in Silver 14 Ounces and
about ⅓ or 3 
l. 14 s. 2 d.
 of
English Money.


That the English Coyn may
want neither the 
purity
 nor the

weight
 required, it is most wise∣ly
and carefully provided, that
once every year the 
Chief Offi∣cers

of the 
Mint
 appear before
the 
Lords of the Council
 in the

Star-Chamber
 at 
Westminster,

with some pieces of all sorts of
Moneys-coined the fore-going
year, taken at adventure out


of the 
Mint,
 and kept under
several Locks by several per∣sons
till that appearance, and
then by a 
Jury
 of 24 able

Goldsmiths
 in the presence of
the said 
Lords,
 every piece is
most exactly assaied and
weighed.


Since the happy restauration
of His Majesty now raigning,
the coyning or stamping of Mo∣ney
by 
Hammers
 hath been laid
aside, and all stampt by an En∣gine
or Skrew; whereby it is
come to pass that our 
Coins

for 
neatness, gracefulness,
 and

security
 from 
counterfeiting,
 sur∣pass
all the most excellent
Coins not only of the Romans,
but of all the Modern Nations
in the World.



In 
England
 at the beginning
of Christianity they counted as
all other Christians,
 according
to the then Roman Account, by

Olympiads
 or space of five years.
Afterwards (in the Raign of

Constantine
 the first Christian
Emperour) by 
Indictions
 or
Fifteen years; at length in the
Raign of the Emperour 
Justi∣nian,

532 years after 
Christs

Incarnation (and not before) all
Christians generally began to
count 
ab Anno Christi Incar∣nati;

at which time one 
Diony∣sius
Exiguus
 or 
Abbas,
 a wor∣thy
Roman, had finisht a 
Cycle

for the Observation of 
Easter,

which was then generally re∣ceived,
and is still observed by
the Church of 
England;
 the
ground whereof is this. The



Vernal Equinox
 at that time
was accounted to be the 21 of

March,
 and by consequence
must be the earliest 
Full Moon,

and then 
March
 the 8 must be
the earliest 
New Moon;
 and 
A∣pril

the 5 the latest 
New Moon,

and 
April
 the 18 the latest 
Full
Moon;
 which happening on a

Sunday
 (as it will when the

Dominical
 Letter is C. and the

Golden Number 8)
 then 
Easter

that year will be 
April
 25. So
when the New Moon shall be
on 
March
 8, and that happen∣ing
on a Sunday (as it will when
the Dominical Letter is 
D.
 and
the Golden Number 16) then

Easter
 will be on the 22 
March,

as was this year 1668.


But the Romish Church fol∣lowing
new Rules for finding of

Easter,
 it happens sometimes


that their 
Easter
 is full 5 weeks
before ours, and sometimes
with ours, but never after ours;
for Pope 
Gregory
 the 13th in
the year 1582, having obser∣ved
that upon exact account
the year contained above 365
dayes, not full 6 hours (as had
been from the time of 
Julius
Caesar
 hitherto reckoned) but
only 5 hours 49 minutes and
16 seconds, and that this diffe∣rence
of almost 11 minutes in
the space of about 134 years,
maketh one whole day, which
not considered since the Regu∣lation
of 
Easter,
 had brought
back the year at least 10 dayes;
insomuch that the 
Vernal Equi∣nox

which was at first on the
21 of 
March,
 was now on the
11th of 
March;
 by reason
whereof sometimes 2 Full


Moons past between the 
Equi∣nox

and 
Easter,
 contrary to
the Primitive Institution there∣of;
which was, that 
Easter

should alwayes be observed on
the Sunday following the first

ull Moon after the 
Vernal E∣quinox,

Pope 
Gregory
 then ha∣ving
observed these inconveni∣ences,
resolved at once to take
away 10 dayes, and that out of
the Moneth of 
October,
 by
calling the 5th day thereof the
15th, and that for that year
those Festivals which fell in
those 10 dayes, which by rea∣son
of the Vintage time were
but few, should be celebrated
upon the 15, 16, and 17th
dayes of that Moneth. And
that the 
Equinox
 might never

retrocede
 for the future, it was
then provided that every 400


years 3 
Bissextile years
 should
be left out; that is, in the
years 1700, 1800, and 1900,
and so again in 2100, 2200,
and 2300, leaving the year
2000 to have its 
Bissextile,
 and
so every 400th year.


The English Nation, as all
other States that with-drew▪
themselves from under the
Bishop of 
Rome
's Usurped Au∣thority,
before the said year
1582, except 
Holland
 and 
Zea∣land,

observe still the Antient
Account made by 
Julius Cae∣sar

43 years before the Birth of
Christ; and is therefore called
the 
Old Style
 or 
Julian Ac∣count:

the other observed by
those still under the Romish
Yoke, is called the 
New Style

or 
Gregorian Account;
 and is
(by reason of the aforesaid 10


dayes taken away) 10 dayes
before ours for the beginning
of Moneths, and for all Fixt
Festivals; but various for all
Moveable Festivals.


Easter
 and the other 
Move∣able
Feasts
 in 
England,
 are most
certainly thus found. 
Shrove-Tuesday

is alwayes the first

Tuesday
 after the first 
New
Moon
 after 
January,
 except
that 
New Moon
 happen on a
Tuesday, then the next is

Shrove-Tuesday,
 and the Sun∣day
following is 
Quadragesima,

and the Sixth Sunday after is

Easter Day,
 and the Fifth Sun∣day
after 
Easter
 is 
Rogation Sun∣day,

and the Thursday follow∣ing,
being 40 dayes after the
Resurrection, is 
Ascention day;

10 dayes after which, or 50
dayes after 
Easter
 is 
Pentecoste



or 
Whit sunday,
 and the Sunday
following is 
Trinity Sunday:

Which Computation of the
Church of 
England
 agrees with
all the Eastern Christian
Churches, for they and we
find 
Easter
 by the Rules which
were generally received by all
Christendom, 
Anno
 532, and
ever since till 1582, it was al∣tered
by the Pope as aforesaid,
yet cannot it be denied but that
this old Computation is be∣come
erroneous; for by our
Rules, two 
Easters
 will be ob∣served
within one year, as in
the last year 1667, and not
one 
Easter
 to be observed this
year; as this Author observed
the last year in his Proposals to
the Parliament.


Advent Sunday
 hath a pecu∣liar
Rule, and is alwayes the


Fourth 
Sunday
 before 
Christ∣mass
Day,
 or the nearest Sun∣day
to St. 
Andrews,
 whether be∣fore
or after.


The year in 
England
 ac∣cording
to the 
Cycles
 of the

Sun
 and 
Moon,
 and according
to 
Almanacks
 begins on the
First of 
January;
 but the En∣glish
Church and State begins
the year from the day of 
Christs
Incarnation, viz.
 on the 25 of

March,
 which also is observed
in 
Spain;
 yet the 
Portugues
 (as
divers Countries in 
Africa)
 be∣gin
their year on the 29th of

August,
 the 
Venetians
 on the
first of 
March
 according to the

Epact,
 the 
Grecians
 on the
longest day, as the old 
Romans

did on the shortest day; which
two last seem to have most rea∣son,
as beginning just at the



Periodical
 day of the Suns re∣turn.


The 
Natural
 day consisting
of 24 hours, is begun in 
Eng∣land

at 
Midnight,
 and counted
by 12 hours to 
Midday,
 and a∣gain
by 12 hours to next Mid∣night;
whereas in 
Italy, Bohe∣mia,
Poland,
 and some other
Countries, their Account 

from Sun-setting by 24 of th

Clock to the next Sun-setting
and at 
Noremberg
 and 
Wirten∣berg

in 
Germany,
 according to
the old 
babylonian
 Account
they begin at the first hour af∣ter
Sun-rising, to count one of
the Clock, and so again at the
first hour after Sun-set.


Probably there was a time
when those Names of 
Number

now in use amongst all Civilized


Nations were unknown, and
Men applied their Fingers of
one or both hands to those
things they desired to keep ac∣count
of; and thence it may be
that the Numeral words are but

Ten
 in any Nation, and in
some Nations but 
Five;
 and
then they begin again, as af∣ter

decem, undecim, duode∣cim,
&c.


The 
Hebrews
 and the 
Greeks

instead of Numeral Words u∣sed
the Letters of their 
Alpha∣bets,

beginning again after the

Tenth
 Letter.


The 
Latines
 made use onely
of 7 of their 
Capital Alphabet,
viz
 MDCLXVI, all com∣prehended
in this Figure O
and all made use of in
the same order, in the late year
1666, which never did happen


before, or ever will happen a∣gain.


The 
English
 (as all the We∣stern
Christian World till about
400 years ago) used only 
Nu∣meral
Words
 in all Writings;
but since use the Figures 1, 2,
3, 
&c.
 which the 
Christians

learnt first of the 
Maures
 or 
A∣rabs,

and they of the 
Indians.


Nomina quasi Notamina,

Names were first imposed upon
Men for distinction sake by the

Jews
 at their 
Circumcision,
 by
the 
Romans
 at the 9th day after

Birth,
 and by the 
Christians
 at
the 
Baptisme;
 of such signifi∣cation
for the most part that
might denote the future good
hope or good wishes of Parents
toward their Children.




The English Names of
 Bap∣tisme

are generally either
 Sax∣on,

as
 Robert, Richard, Hen∣ry,
William, Edward, Ed∣mund,
Edwin, Gilbert, Walter,
Leonard, &c. 
Which are all
very significative; or else out
of the
 Old 
and
 New Testament,

as
 John, Thomas, James, A∣braham,
Isaack, Jacob, &c.


Names super-added to the
Christian Names the French
call 
Sur noms (i. e.) superno∣mina.




The 
Hebrews, Greeks,
 and
most other Antient Nations,
had no 
Surnames
 fixt to their
Families as in these dayes, but
counted thus, for example a∣mong
the 
Hebrews, Melchi Ben
Addi, Addi Ben Casam, &c.

So the 
Britaines, Hughe ap


Owen, Owen ap Rhese, &c.
 so
the 
Irish, Neal mac Con, Con
mac Dermoti, &c.


As Christian Names were
first given for distinction of Per∣sons,
so Surnames for distin∣ction
of Families.


About 
Anno
 1000 the

French
 Nation began to take
Surnames with 
de
 prefixt, as
at this day is their usual manner.
The English also took to them∣selves
Surnames, but not ge∣nerally
by the Common Peo∣ple,
till the Raign of 
Edw.
 2.


At first, for Surnames the
English Gentry took the Name
of their Birth-place or Habita∣tion,
as 
Thomas
 of 
Aston
 or

East-Town, John
 of 
Sutton
 or

South-Town;
 and as they alter∣ed
their Habitation, so they
altered their Surname. After,


when they became Lords of
places, they called themselves

Thomas Aston
 of 
Aston, John
Sutton
 of 
Sutton.


The Common People for
Surnames added their Fathers
Name with 
Son
 at the end
thereof, as 
Thomas Johnson;
Robert Richardson.
 They also
oft took their Fathers Nick
Name or abbreviation, with
addition of s, as 
Gibs,
 the
Nick Name or abbreviation of

Gilbert, Hobs
 of 
Robert, Nicks

of 
Nicholas, Bates
 of 
Bartho∣lomew,
Sams
 of 
Samuel;
 and
thence also 
Gibson, Hobson,
Nickson, Batson, Samson, &c.

Many also were surnamed from
their 
Trade,
 as 
Smith, Joyner,
Weaver, &c.
 Or from their

Office,
 as 
Porter, Steward,
Sheepheard, Carter,
 or from


their 
Place of Abode,
 as 
Atwood,
Atwell, Athill;
 which since
are shrunk into 
Wood, Wells,
Hill.


The Normans at their first
coming into 
England
 brought
Surnames for many of their
Gentry with 
de
 prefixt, as the
French Gentry doth generally
at this day, and their Christian
Names were generally German;
they being originally descend∣ed
from a part of North 
Ger∣many.

And some for about
200 years after the Conquest,
took for Surname their Fathers
Christian Name, with 
Fitz
 or

Fils
 prefixt, as 
Robert Fitz-William,
Henry Fitz-Gerard,
&c.


The 
Britains
 or 
Welsh
 more
lately civilized, did not take
Surnames till of late years, and


that for the most part only, by
leaving out 
a
 in 
ap,
 and annex∣ing
the 
p
 to their Fathers Chri∣stian
Name; as instead of 
E∣van
ap Rice,
 now 
Evan Price;

so instead of 
ap Howel, Powel;
ap Hughe, Pughe; ap Rogers,
Progers, &c.


The most ancient Families
and of best account for Sur∣names
in 
England,
 are either
those that are taken from Pla∣ces
in 
Normandy
 and therea∣bouts
in 
France,
 and from
some other Transmarine Coun∣tries,
or else from Places in

England
 and 
Scotland;
 as 
De∣vereux,
Seymour, Nevile, Mon∣tague,
Mohun, Biron, Bruges,
Clifford, Berkley, Darcy,
Stourton, &c.
 which antiently
had all 
de
 prefixt, but of later
times generally neglected.








Of the Government
of ENGLAND in
general.


OF Governments there can
be but three Kinds, for
either One or More, or All,
must have the Soveragn Power
of a Nation. If One, then it
is a 
Monarchy;
 If More (that
is an Assembly of Choice Per∣sons)
then it is an 
Aristocracy;

If All (that is the General As∣sembly
of the People) then it
is a 
Democracy.


Of all Governments the
Monarchical, as most resem∣bling
the 
Divinity,
 and nearest
approaching to 
perfection
 (uni∣ty
being the perfection of all


things) hath ever been estemed
the most excellent.





For the Transgressions of a
Land, many are the Princes or
Rulers thereof, 
Prov.
 28. 2.


Of Monarchies some are

Despotical,
 where the Subjects
like Servants are at the Arbi∣trary
Power and Will of their
Soveraign, as the 
Turks
 and

Barbarians:
 Others 
Political
 or

Paternal,
 where the Subject
like Children under a Father,
are governed by equal and just
Laws, consented and sworn
unto by the King; as is done by
all Christian Princes at their
Coronations.



Of 
Paternal
 Monarchies,
some are 
Hereditary,
 where
the Crown descends either on∣ly
to Heirs Male, as in 
France;

or next of Blood, as in 
Spain,
England, &c.
 Others 
Elective,

where upon the death of every
Prince, without respect had
to the Heirs or next of Blood,
another by Solemn Election is
appointed to succeed, as in

Poland
 and 
Hungary;
 and till
of late in 
Denmark
 and 
Bo∣hemia.


Of Hereditary 
Paternal
 Mo∣narchies,
some are 
dependent

and holden of Earthly Poten∣tates,
and are obliged to do

Homage
 for the same; as the
Kingdoms of 
Scotland
 and 
Man,

that held 
in Capite
 of the
Crown of 
England,
 and the
Kingdome of 
Naples,
 holden of


the Pope; others 
independent,

holden only of God, acknow∣ledging
no other Superiour up∣on
Earth.


England
 is an 
Hereditary Pa∣ternal
Monarchy,
 governed by
one 
Supreme, Independent,
 and

Undeposable Head,
 according
to the known Laws and Cu∣stoms
of the Kingdom.


It is a 
Free
 Monarchy, chal∣lenging
above many other 
Eu∣ropean

Kingdoms, a freedom
from all Subjection to the 
Em∣perour

or Laws of the Empire;
for that the 
Roman Emperours

obtaining antiently the Domi∣nion
of this Land by force of
Arms, and afterwards aban∣doning
the same, the Right
by the Law of Nations return∣ed
to the former Owners 
pro de∣relicto,

as 
Civilians
 speak.



It is a Monarchy free from
all manner of Subjection to
the 
Bishop of Rome,
 and there∣by
from divers inconveniencies
and burdens, under which the
neighbouring Kingdoms groan;
as 
Appeals to Rome
 in sundry

Ecclesiastical Suits, Provisions,

and 
Dispensations,
 in several ca∣ses
to be procured from thence;
many 
Tributes
 and 
Taxes
 paid
to that Bishop, 
&c.


It is a Monarchy free from all

Interregnum,
 and with it from
many mischiefs whereunto E∣lective
Kingdoms are subject.


England
 is such a Monarchy,
as that, by the necessary
subordinate Concurrence of
the Lords and Commons in the
making and repealing all Sta∣tutes
or Acts of Parliament,
it hath the main advantages


of an 
Aristocracy
 and of a 
De∣mocracy,

and yet free from the
disadvantages and evils of ei∣ther.


It is such a Monarchy, as by
a most admirable temperament
affords very much to the 
Indu∣stry,
Liberty,
 and 
Happiness
 of
the 
Subject,
 and yet reserves
enough for the 
Majesty
 and 
Pre∣rogative

of any King that will
own his people as Subjects, not
as Slaves.


It is a Kingdom that of all
the Kingdoms of the World is
most like the Kingdom of 
Je∣sus
Christs;
 whose yoke is easie,
whose burden is light.


It is a Monarchy that with∣out
interruption hath been con∣tinued
almost 1000 years, and
(till of late) without any at∣tempts
of change of that Go∣vernment:


so that to this sort
of Government the English
seem to be naturally inclined,
and therefore during the late

Bouleversations
 or over-turn∣ings,
when all the art that the
Devil or Man could imagine,
was industriously made use of to
change this Monarchy into a
Democracy, this Kingdom in∣to
a Common-wealth, the
most and the best of English
Men, the general Spirit and
Genius of the Nation (not so
much the Presbiterian or Roy∣alist)
by mighty though invi∣sible
influence, concurred at
once to restore their exiled So∣veraign,
and re-establish that
antient Government.








Of the KING of
ENGLAND.


THe 
King
 is so called from
the 
Saxon
 word 
Koning,

intimating 
Power
 and 
Know∣ledge,

wherewith every Sove∣raigne
should especially be in∣vested.


The
 Title 
antiently of the

Saxon 
King
 Edgar 
was
 Anglo∣rum
Basileus & Dominus qua∣tuor
Marium,
 viz. 
the
 British,
German, Irish, 
and
 Deucalido∣nian

Seas; and sometimes
 An∣glorum
Basileus omniumque Re∣gum,
Insularum, Oceanique
Britanniam circumsacentis,
cunctarumque Nationum quae in∣fra


eum includuntur Imperator
& Dominus.


The Modern Title more mo∣dest,
is,
 Dei Gratiâ 
of
 England,
Scotland, France, 
and
 Ireland
King, Defender of the Faith.


The King only is 
Dei Gra∣tiâ

simply 
(i.e.)
 from the fa∣vour
of none but God; and
the Archbishops and Bishops
that pretend to that Title, must
understand, 
Dei gratiâ & Re∣gis,

or, 
Dei gratiâ & volun∣tate
Regis.


Defender of the Faith, was
antiently used by the Kings of

England,
 as appears by seve∣ral
Charters granted to the U∣niversity
of 
Oxford,
 but in the
year 1521 more affixt by a

Bull
 from Pope 
Leo
 the Tenth
for a Book written by 
Henry
 the
Eighth against 
Luthers,
 in de∣fence


of some points of the
Romish Religion; but since
continued for defence of the

Antient Catholck
 and 
Apostolick
Faith.


Primogenitus Ecclesiae
 be∣longs
to the Kings of 
England,

because their Predecessor 
Luci∣us

was the first King that em∣braced
Christianity.


Christianissimus
 was by the

Lateran Council
 under Pope

Julius
 the 2d conferred on the
Kings of 
England
 in the 5th
year of 
Henry
 8, though now
used only by the French King.


The Title of 
Grace
 was first
given to the King about the
time of 
H.
 4. to 
H. 6. Excel∣lent
Grace,
 to 
Ed. 4. High and
Mighty Prince,
 to 
Hen.
 8. first

Highness
 then 
Majesty,
 and
now 
Sacred Majesty;
 after the


Custom of the Eastern Empe∣rours,
that used 
.


The King of 
England
 in his
Publick Instruments and Let∣ters
stiles himself 
Nos, We,
 in
the plural number; before
King 
John
's time the Kings u∣sed
the singular number, which
Custom is still seen in the end
of Writs, 
Teste meipso apu

Westm.


In speaking to the King is u∣sed
often (besides 
Your Maje∣sty)
Syr,
 from 
Cyr,
 in the

Greek
 
 an Abbreviation o


 and 
, 
Dominus

much used to the 
Greek
 Empe∣rours;
but 
Syr
 or 
Domine
 i

now in 
England
 become the
ordinary word to all of better
rank, even from the King to
the Gentleman. It was anti∣ently
in 
England
 given to



Lords,
 afterwards to 
Knights,

and to 
Clergymen,
 prefixt be∣fore
their Christian Names;

ow in that manner only to 
Ba∣
onets

and 
Knights of the Bath,

and 
Knights Batchelours,
 yet in

France Syr
 or 
Syre
 is reserved
only for their King.


About the time that our Sa∣viour
lived on Earth, there
was a Jewish Sect, whose Ring-
eader
was one 
Judas
 of 
Gaile,

mentioned 
Acts
 5. 37. that
would not give this Title of

Sir
 or 
Dominus
 to any man;
affirming that it was proper on∣ly
to God, and stood (not un∣like
our new Fanaticks, called
Quakers) so perversely for
such Nominal Liberty (being

n other points meer 
Pharisees)

that no penalties could force
them to give this honorary


Title to any man, no not to
the Emperour; 
uti videre 

apud Josephum & alios. Sed h

obiter.


The 
Saxon
 Kings before the
Conquest bare.
 
Azure a Cross

Formy
 between four 
Martlet
Or.


Afterward the
 Danish 
King
raigning in
 England 
bare
 o

Semi de Harts, Gules 3 Lyon
Passant Gardant Azure.


After the Conquest the
Kings of 
England
 bare two

Leopards,
 born first by the
Conquerour as Duke of 
Nor∣mandy,

till the time of 
Hen.
 2
who in right of his Mother an∣next
her Paternal Coat the

Lyon
 of 
Aquitaine,
 which be∣ing
of the same 
Field, Mettal▪

and 
Form
 with the 
Leopards,




om thence-forward they were

intly marshalled in one 
Shield,

and 
Blazoned 3 Lyons,
 as at

resent.


King 
Edward
 the 
Third
 in

ght of his Mother claiming

he Crown of 
France,
 with the
Arms of 
England
 quartered
the Arms of 
France,
 which
then were 
Azure, Semy Flower

eluces Or;
 afterwards chang∣ed
to 3 
Flower deluces:
 where∣upon

Hen.
 5. of 
England
 cau∣sed
the English Arms to be
changed likewise: King 
James

upon the Union of 
England

and 
Scotland,
 caused the Arms
of 
France
 and 
England
 to be
quartered with 
Scotland
 and 
Ire∣land,

and are thus blazoned.


The King of 
England
 bear∣eth
for his Soveraign 
Ensigns
Armorial
 as followeth:



In the first place, 
Azure 3
Flower deluces Or;
 for the 
Re∣gal

Arms of 
France
 quartered
with the 
Imperial
 Ensigns of

England,
 which are 
Gules thre

Lyons Passant Gardant in Pal

Or.
 In the second place, with
in a double 
Tressure counter-flowered
de lys Or, a Lyon Ram∣pant
Gules
 for the 
Royal
 Arms
of 
Scotland.
 In the third place

Azure
 an 
Irish Harp Or String∣ed
Argent,
 for the 
Royal
 En∣signs
of 
Ireland.
 In the fourth
place as in the first, All with∣in
the 
Garter,
 the chief Ensign
of that most Honourable Or∣der,
above the same an 
Helmet

answerable to His Majesties So∣veraign
Jurisdiction, upon the
same a rich 
Mantle
 of Cloth of
Gold 
doubled Ermine,
 adorned
with an 
Imperial
 Crown, and


surmounted for a Crest by a

Lyon Passant Gardant Crowned

with the like; supported by

 
Lyon Rampant Gardant Or,
Crowned
 as the former, and an

unicorn Argent Gorged,
 with a
Crown, thereto a 
Chain
 af∣fixt
passing between his fore∣
egs
and reflext over his back

Or,
 both standing upon a Com∣partment
placed underneath,
and in the Table of the Com∣partment
His Majesties Royal

Motto, Dieu & mon Droit.


The Supporters used before
the Union of 
England
 and 
Scot∣land

were the 
Dragon
 and 
Lyon.


The Arms of 
France
 placed
first, for that 
France
 is the
greater Kingdom, and because
from the first bearing, those

Flowers
 have been alwayes 
En∣signs

of a 
Kingdom;
 whereas


the Arms of 
England
 were o∣riginally
of 
Dukedoms
 as before∣said.


The Motto upon the Garter,

Honi soit qui mal y pense;
 that
is, 
Shame be to him that evil
thereof thinketh,
 was first gi∣ven
by 
Edward
 3 the Foun∣der
of that Order, upon occasi∣on
as some have written of
a Garter falling from the
Countess of 
Kent
 and 
Salisbu∣ry

as she danced, and taken up
by that King; whereat the
Queen being jealous, or the
Courtiers observing it, the
King first uttered those words
now upon the Garter, whereof
the Order was soon after insti∣tuted.


The Motto 
Dieu & mon
Droit,
 that is, 
God and my
Right,
 was first given by 
Richard



the First, to intimate that the
King of 
England
 holdeth his
Empire not in Vassallage of a∣ny
mortal man, but of God on∣ly;
and after taken up by 
Ed∣ward

3. when he first claimed
the Kingdom of 
France.


King 
William
 the Conque∣rour
getting by right of Con∣quest
all the Lands of 
England

(except Lands belonging to the
Church,
 to Monastenies, and
Religious Houses) into his own
hands in 
Demesne,
 as Lawyers
speak, soon bestowed amongst
his Subjects a
 great part there∣of,
reserving some retribution
of Rents and Services, or both
to him and his Heirs Kings of

England;
 which reservation, is
now, as it was before the Con∣quest,
called the Tenure of


Lands; the rest he reserved to
himself in 
Demesne,
 called 
Co∣ronae
Regis Dominica, Domaines,

and 
Sacra Patrimonia, Praedium
Domini Regis, Directum Do∣minum,
cujus nullus est Author
nisi Deus:
 all other Lands in

England
 being held now of
some Superiour, and depend
mediately or immediately on
the Crown; but the Lands
possest by the Crown, being
held of none, can 
escheat
 to
none; being 
sacred,
 cannot be∣come

prophane:
 are or should
be permanent and inalienable.
Which Royal Domaines are
(by Time, the Gift and Boun∣ty
of our Kings, and some
Necessities for the preservation
of the Weal Publick) too
much alienated.



The Antient 
Dominions
 of
the Kings of 
England,
 were
first, 
England
 and all the 
Seas

round about 
Great Britain
 and

Ireland,
 and all the 
Isles adja∣cent,

even too the 
Shores
 of all
the Neighbour Nations; and
our Law saith the 
Sea
 is of the

Ligeance
 of the King, as well
as the 
Land:
 and as a mark
thereof, all ships of 
Foreigners

have antiently demanded leave
to fish and pass in these Seas,
and do at this day 
Lower
 their

Top-sailes
 to all the Kings Ships
of War.


To 
England Henry
 1. an∣next

Normandy,
 and 
Henry 2.
Ireland,
 being stiled only Lord
of 
Ireland
 till 33 
H.
 8. al∣though
they had all Kingly Ju∣risdiction
before.




Henry
 2. also annext the
Dukedomes of 
Guien
 and 
An∣jou,

the Counties of 
Poictou,
Turein,
 and 
Mayn. Edward

the First all 
Wales,
 and 
Ed∣ward

the Third the Right,
though not the Possession of all

France.


King 
James
 added 
Scotland,

and since that time there have
been super-added sundry con∣siderable
Plantations in 
Ame∣rica.


The Dominions of the King
of 
England
 are at this day in
Possession (besides his just
Right and Title to the King∣dom
of 
France)
 all 
England,
Scotland,
 and 
Ireland,
 Three
Kingdoms of large extent,
with all the Isles, above 40 in
number small and great; where∣of
some very considerable: and


all the Seas adjacent. Moreo∣ver
the Islands of 
Jersey,
Garnsey,
 and 
Alderny,
 Parcel
of the Dutchy of 
Normandy;

besides those profitable Plan∣tations
of 
New England, Vir∣ginia,
Barbados, Jamaica,
Florida, Bermudos;
 besides se∣veral
other Isles and Places in
those Quarters, and some in
the 
East Indies
 and upon the
Coast of 
Africa;
 also upon the
main land of 
America,
 by
right of first discovery; to 
E∣stoit
land, Terra Corterialis,
New found Land, Novum Bel∣gium,
Guiana,
 the King of

England
 hath a Legal Right,
though not Possession.


Rex Angliae est Persona mixta
cum Sacerdote,
 say our Lawyers.
He is a 
Priest
 as well as a King.



He is anointed with 
Oyle,
 as
the Priests were at first, and af∣terward
the Kings of 
Israel;
 to
intimate that his Person is 
Sa∣cred

and 
Spiritual:
 and there∣fore
at the Coronation hath
put upon him a 
Sacerdotal
Garment
 called the 
Dalmatica,
&c.
 and before the Reforma∣tion
of 
England,
 when the
Cup in the Lords Supper was
denied to the Laity, the King
as a Spiritual Person received
in both kinds: He is capable of

Spiritual Jurisdiction,
 of hold∣ing
of 
Tythes,
 all 
Extra-Paro∣chial
Tythes
 some Proxies,
and other Spiritual Profits be∣long
to the King, of which
Laymen both by Common
and Canon Law are pronoun∣ced
uncapable.




He is an
 External Bishop 
of
the Church, as
 Constantine 
the
Emperour said of himself,


; But I am con∣stituted
Bishop for external things
of the Church.


Rex idem hominum Phaebique
Sacerdos.


He is as the Roman Empe∣rours
Christian as well as Hea∣then
stiled themselves, 
Ponti∣fex
Max.
 He is the Supreme

Pastor
 of 
England,
 and hath
not only Right of Ecclesiastical
Government, but also of Exerci∣sing
some Ecclesiastical Functi∣on
so far as 
Solomon
 did, 1 
Kings

8. when he blessed the People,
consecrated the Temple, and
pronounced that Prayer which


is the Pattern now for Conse∣cration
of all Churches and
Chappels; but all the Ministe∣rial
Offices are left to the 
Bi∣shops

and 
Priests,
 as the deter∣minination
of Causes are to the
Kings Judges, although the
King may himself sit in Judge∣ment,
if the Affairs of State did
not alwayes require his Presence
at the Helme; and the Admini∣stration
of Sacraments, Preach∣ing,
and other Church Offices
and Duties to the Bishops and
their Ordained Clergy.


Of this 
Sacred Person
 of the
King, of the 
life
 and 
safety
 there∣of,
the Laws and Customs of

England
 are of 
tender,
 that they
have made it 
High Treason,
 one∣ly
to 
imagine
 or 
intend
 the 
death

of the 
King.
 And because by
imagining or conspiring the


death of the Kings 
Counsellors
 or

Great Officers
 of his 
Houshold,

the destruction of the King
hath thereby sometimes ensued,
and is usually aimed at (saith

Stat. 3 H. 7.)
 that also was
made 
felony,
 to be punisht
with death, although in all o∣ther
Cases Capital the Rule is

Voluntas non reputabitur pro fa∣cto;

and an English Man may
not in other Cases be punisht
with death, unless the Act fol∣low
the Intent.


The Law of 
England
 hath so
high esteem of the Kings 
Per∣son,

that to offend against
those 
Persons
 and those 
things

that represent his 
Sacred Per∣son,

as to kill some of the

Crown Officers
 or the 
Kings
Judges
 executing their Office,
or to counterfeit the 
Kings


Seals,
 or his 
Moneys,
 is made

High Treason;
 because by all
these the Kings 
Person
 is repre∣sented:
and High Treason is in
the Eye of the Law so horrid,
that besides loss of Life and
Honour, Real and Personal
Estate, to the Criminal, 
his
Heirs
 also are to lose the same
for ever, and to be ranked a∣mongst
the 
Peasantry
 and 
Ig∣noble,

till the King shall please
to restore them. 
Est enim tam
grave crimen
 (saith 
Bracton) ut
vix permittitur haeredibus qu
d
vivant.
 High Treason is so
grievous a Crime, that the
Law not content with the Life
and Estate and Honour of the
Criminal, can hardly endure
to see his heirs survive him,


And rather than Treason a∣gainst
the Kings 
Person
 shall go


unpunisht, the Innocent in
some Cases shall be punished;
for if an Idiot or Lunatick (who
cannot be said to have any
will, and so cannot offend) du∣ring
his Idiocy or Lunacy,
shall kill, or go about to kill
the King, he shall be punisht
as a Traytor; and yet being

Non compos mentis,
 the Law
holds that he cannot commit
Felony or Petit Treason, not
other sorts of High Treason.


Moreover, for the precious
regard of the 
Person
 of the

King,
 by an Antient Record it
is declared, that no 
Physick

ought to be administred to him,
without good 
Warrant,
 this
Warrant to be made by the
Advice of his 
Council;
 no o∣ther
Physick but what is menti∣oned
in the Warrant ro be ad∣ministred


to him; the 
Physitians

to prepare all things with their
own hands, and not by the
hands of any 
Apothecary;
 and
to use the assistance only of such

Chyrurgeons
 as are prescribed in
the Warrant.


And so precious is the 
Person

and 
Life
 of the King, that e∣very
Subject is obliged and
bound by his Allegeance to
defend his Person in his 
Natural

aswell as 
Politick
 Capacity with
his own 
Life
 and 
Limbs;

wherefore the Law saith that
the 
life
 and 
member
 of every

Subject
 is at the service of the

Soveraign.
 He is 
Pater Patriae
& Dulce erit pro Patre Patriae
mori,
 to lose life or limb in de∣fending
him from Conspiracies,
Rebellions, or Invasions, or in
the Execution of his Laws,


should seem a pleasant thing to
every loyal hearted Subject.


The 
Office
 of the 
King
 of

England,
 (according to the
Learned 
Fortescue)
 is, 
Pugnare
bella populi sui & eos rectissime
judicare.
 To fight the Battels
of his People, and to see Right
and Justice done unto them.


Or (according to another) it
is to protect and govern his
People, so that they may (if
possible) lead quiet and peacea∣ble
lives in all Godliness and
Honesty under him.


Or more particular (as is
promised at the Coronation)
to preserve the 
Rights
 and 
Pri∣viledges

of the 
Church
 and

Clergy,
 the 
Royal Prerogatives

belonging to the Crown, the

Laws
 and 
Customs
 of the Realm,


to do Justice, shew Mercy, and
keep Peace and Vnity, 
&c.


The 
King
 for the better per∣formance
of this great and
weighty 
Office,
 hath certain

Jura Majestatis,
 extraordina∣ry
Powers, Preeminencies, and
Priviledges, inherent in the
Crown, called antiently by
Lawyers 
Sacra Sacrorum,
 and

Flowers of the Crown,
 but com∣monly

Royal Prerogatives;

whereof some the King holds
by the 
Law of Nations,
 others
by 
Common Law
 (excellent a∣bove
all Laws in upholding a
free Monarchy and exalting the
Kings Prerogative) and some
by 
Statute Law.


The King only and the King
alone, by his Royal Preroga∣tive,
hath Power without Act


of Parliament to 
declare War,
make Peace, send and receive
Ambassadours, make Leagues

and 
Treaties
 with any Foreign
States, give 
Commissions
 for

levying Men
 and 
Arms
 by Sea
and Land, or for pressing Men
if need require, dispose of all

Magazines, Ammunition, Ca∣stles,
Fortresses, Ports, Havens,
Ships
 of 
War,
 and 
Publick Mo∣neys;

hath the sole Power to

coyn Money,
 appoint the 
Met∣tal,
Weight, Purity,
 and 
Value

thereof, and by his 
Proclamati∣on

make any 
Foreign Coyn
 to be
lawful Money of 
England.


By his 
Royal Prerogative

may of his meer Will and Plea∣sure

Convoke, Adjourn, Pro∣rogue,
Remove,
 and 
Dissolve

Parliaments; may to any 
Bill

passed by both 
Houses
 of 
Parli∣ament,



refuse to give (without
rendring any reason) his 
Royal
Assent,
 without which a 
Bill

is as a Body without a Soul.
May at pleasure encrease the
number of the Members of
both Houses, by creating more

Barons
 and bestowing 
Privi∣ledges

upon any other 
Towns

to send 
Burgesses
 to 
Parliament.

May call to Parliament by
Writ whom he in his Princely
Wisdome thinketh fit, and may
refuse to send his Writ to o∣thers
that have sate in former
Parliaments. Hath alone the
choice and nomination of all

Commanders
 and other 
Officers

at Land and Sea, the choice
and nomination of all 
Magi∣strates,
Counsellors,
 and 
Offi∣cers
of State,
 of all 
Bishops
 and
other 
High Dignities
 in the



Church,
 the bestowing of all

onours both of higher and of

wer Nobility of 
England,


he Power of determining 
Re∣
ards

and 
Punishments.


By His
 Letters Patents 
may

ect new
 Counties, Bishopricks,

niversities, Cities, Burroughs,

lledges, Hospitals, Schools,

airs, Markets, Courts of Ju∣
ice,
Forests, Chases, Free

arrens, &c.


The King by his Prerogative

th power to 
enfranchise
 an

lien
 and make him a 
Denison,


hereby he is enabled to pur∣
ase
Leases of Houses and

ands, and to bear some Offi∣
es.
Hath power to grant Let∣

of 
Mart
 or 
Reprisal.


The King by his Preroga∣
ive
hath had at all times the

not permitted to the Subject.



The King by his Prerogativ

may demand reasonable 
Aid
Money
 of his▪ Subjects to Knigh

his Eldest Son at the Age of 15
and to marry his Eldest
Daughter at the Age of 

years, which reasonable Aid
is Twenty Shillings for every
Knights Fee, and as much for
every Twenty Pound a year in

Socage.
 Moreover, if the King
be taken Prisoner; Aid Money
is to be paid by the Subjects to
set him at liberty.

None but the King can hold

ourt of his Tenants.


The King of 
England
 by his

rerogative is 
Summus Regni

ustos,
 and hath the Custody

f the Persons and Estates of

uch as for want of understanding

annot govern themselves
 
 or

erve the King; so the Persons

nd Estates of 
Ideots
 and 
Lu∣
aticks

are in the Custody of

he King, that of Ideots to


his own use, and that of Lu
∣naticks
to the use of the nex

Heir. So the Custody or Ward
ships
of all such Infants who

Ancestors held their Lands b

Tenure in 
Capite
 or Knight
service, were ever since th

Conquest in the Kings of 
Eng∣land,

to the great honour an

benefit of the King and King
dom,
though some abuse

made some of the people out 

love with their good, and th

Right of that part of his ju

Prerogative.


The King by his Preroga∣tive
is 
Ultimus Haeres Regni

and is (as the 
Great Ocean
 is 

all Rivers) the 
receptacle
 of a

Estates when no Heir appears
for this cause all Estates fo

want of Heirs or by forfeiture
revert or escheat to the King▪


All spiritual Benefices for want
of Presentation by the Bishop,
is lapsed at last to the King;
all 
Treasure Trove
 (that is, 
Mo∣ney,
Gold, Silver, Plate,
 or

Bullion,
 found, and the Ow∣ner
unknown) belongs to the
King; so all 
Wayfs, Strays,
Wrecks,
 not granted away by
him or any former Kings; all

Wast ground
 or 
Land recovered

from the 
Sea;
 all Lands of 
A∣liens

dying before 
Naturaliza∣tion

or 
Denization,
 and all
things whereof the property is
not known. All 
Gold and Silver
Mines
 in whosoever ground
they are found; 
Royal Fishes,


s 
Whales, Sturgeons, Dolphins,
&c. Royal Fowl,
 as 
Swans,
 not
markt and swimming at liberty
on the River, belong to the
King.



In the 
Church
 the Kings Pre∣rogative
and Power is extraor∣dinary
great. He only hath the

Patronage
 of all 
Bishopricks,

none can be chosen but by his

Conged' Estier,
 whom he hath
first 
nominated;
 none can be

consecrated
 Bishop or take pos∣session
of the Revenues of the
Bishoprick without the Kings
special Writ or Assent. He is
the Guardian or Nursing Fa∣ther
of the Church, which our
Kings of 
England
 did so reckon
amongst their principal cares,
as in the 23th year of King 
Ed∣ward

the First it was alledg∣ed
in a pleading and allowed.
The King hath power to call a

National
 or 
Provincial Synod,

and by Commissioners or by
his Metropolitanes in their se∣veral
Jurisdictions to make 
Ca∣nons,


Orders, Ordinances,
 and

Constitutions,
 to introduce into
the Church what 
Ceremonies
 he
shall think fit; 
reform
 and 
cor∣rect

all 
Heresies, Schismes,
 and
punish 
Contempts, &c.
 and
therein and thereby to declare
what 
Doctrines
 in the Church
are fit to be 
publisht
 or 
professed,

what 
Translation of the Bible to
be allowed,
 what 
Books
 of the

Bible
 are 
Canonical
 and what

Apocryphal, &c.


In 28 of 
Eliz.
 when the
House of Commons would have
passed Bills touching Bishops
granting Faculties, conferring
Holy Orders, Ecclesiastical Cen∣sures,
the Oath 
Ex Officio, Non
Residency, &c.
 the Queen much
incensed, forbad them to med∣dle
in any Ecclesiastical Affairs,
for that it belonged to her Pre∣rogative,

&c.



The King hath power to 
par∣don

the violation of 
Ecclesiasti∣cal
Laws,
 or to 
abrogate
 such as
are unfitting or useless; to di∣spense
with the Rigour of Ec∣clesiastical
Laws, and with any
thing that is only 
prohibitum &
malum per accidens & non ma∣lum
in se;
 as for a 
Bastard
 to be
a 
Priest,
 for a Priest to hold 
two
Benefices,
 or to 
succeed
 his 
Fa∣ther

in a Benefice, or to be 
Non
Resident, &c.


Hath power to dispense with
some Acts of Parliament, Pe∣nal
Statutes, by 
Non Obstan∣tes,

where himself is only con∣cerned;
to moderate the rigor
of the Laws according to Equi∣ty
and Conscience, to 
alter
 or

suspend
 any 
particular Law,

that he judgeth hurtful to the
Commonwealth; to grant 
spe∣cial


Priviledges and Charters
 to
any Subject, to pardon a man
by Law condemned; to 
inter∣pret

by his Judges 
Statutes,
 and
in Cases not defined by Law, to

determine
 and 
pass Sentence.


And this is that Royal Pre∣rogative
which in the hand of a
King is a Scepter of Gold, but
in the hands of Subjects is a
Rod of Iron.


This is that 
Jus Coronae,
 a
Law that is 
parcel
 of the 
Law
of the Land,
 part of the Com∣mon
Law, and contained in it,
and hath the 
precedence
 of all
Laws and Customs of 
England;

and therefore void in Law is e∣very
Custom 
quae exaltat se in
Praerogativam Regis.


Some of these Prerogatives,
especially those that relate to

Justice
 and 
Peace▪
 are so 
essen∣tial



to Royalty, that they are

for ever inherent
 in the Crown,
and make the Crown: they are
like the Sun-beams in the Sun,
and as inseparable from it; and
therefore it is held by great
Lawyers that a Prerogative in

point of Government
 cannot be

restrained
 or bound by Act of
Parliament, but is as unaltera∣ble
as the Laws of the 
Medes

and 
Persians:
 wherefore the
Lords and Commons 
(Rot.
Parl. 42. Edw. 3. num. 7.)
 de∣clared
that they could not as∣sent
in Parliament to any thing
that tended to the 
disherison
 of
the King and the Crown,
whereunto they were sworn;
no though the King should de∣sire
it: and every King of 
Eng∣land

as he is 
Debitor Justitiae

to his people, so is he in con∣science


obliged to defend and
maintain all the Rights of the
Crown in possession, and to
endeavour the recovery of those
whereof the Crown hath been
dispossest, and when any King
hath not religiously observed
his duty in this point, it hath
proved of very dreadful conse∣quence;
as the first fatal blow
to the Church of 
England
 was
given when 
Hen.
 8. waving his
own Royal Prerogative, refer∣red
the redress of the Church
to the 
House of Commons
 (as
the Lord 
Herbert
 observes

Hist. Hen. 8.)
 So the greatest
blow that ever was given to
Church and State, was when
the late King parting with his
absolute Power of 
dissolving
Parliaments
 gave it (though
only 
pro ill
 vice)
 to the 
Two


Houses of Parliament.
 And in∣deed
it greatly concerns all Sub∣jects
(though it seem a 
Para∣dox)

to be far more solicitous
that the King should maintain
and defend his own 
Prerogative

and 
Preeminence,
 than their

Rights
 and 
Liberties;
 the truth
whereof will appear to any man
that sadly considers the mis∣chiefs
and inconveniencies that
necessarily follow the diminuti∣on
of the Kings Prerogative a∣bove
all that can be occasi∣oned
by some particular in∣fringements
of the Peoples Li∣berties.
As on the other side
it much concerns every King of

England
 to be very careful of
the Subjects just Liberties, ac∣cording
to that Golden Rule of
the best of Kings 
Charles
 I,

That the Kings Prerogative is to


defend the Peoples Liberties,
and the Peoples Liberties
strengthen the Kings Preroga∣tive.


Whatsoever things are pro∣per
to 
Supreme Magistrates,
 as

Crowns, Scepters, Purple R
be,
Golden Globe,
 and 
Holy Uncti∣on,

have as long appertained to
the King of 
England
 as to any
other Prince in 
Europe.
 He
holdeth not his Kingdom in

Vassallage,
 nor receiveth his

Investiture
 or 
Installment
 from
another. Acknowledgeth no

Superiority
 to any but God on∣ly.
Not to the 
Emperour,
 for

Omnem Potestatem habet Rex
Angliae in Regno suo quam Impe∣rator
vendicat in Imperio;
 and
therefore the Crown of 
Eng∣land

hath been declared in Par∣liaments


long ago to be an 
Im∣perial
Crown,
 and the King to
be an 
Emperour of England and
Ireland,
 and might wear an Im∣perial
Crown, although he
choseth rather to wear a 
Tri∣umphant
Crown,
 such as was
anciently worn by the Empe∣rours
of 
Rome,
 and that be∣cause
his Predecessors have tri∣umpht,
not only over 
Five
Kings of Ireland,
 but also over
the 
Welsh, Scottish,
 and 
French
Kings.


He acknowledgeth onely
Precedence to the Emperour,

Eo quod Antiquitate Imperium
omnia Regna superare creditur.


As the King is 
 in
the 
State,
 so he is 

in the 
Church.
 He acknow∣ledgeth
no Superiority to the

Bishop of Rome,
 whose long ar∣rogated


Authority in 
England

was 1535 in a full Parliament
of all the Lords 
Spiritual
 as
well as Temporal declared null,
and the King of 
England
 de∣clared
to be by 
Antient Right

in all Causes over all Persons
as well Ecclesiastical as Ci∣vil,

Supreme Head and Gover∣nour.


The King is 
Summus totius
Ecclesiae Anglicanae Ordinarius,

Supreme Ordinary in all the
Dioceses of 
England
 
,
and for his Su∣perintendency
over the whole
Church, hath the 
Tenths
 and

First-Fruits
 of all Ecclesiasti∣cal
Benefices.


The King hath the Supreme
Right of Patronage over all

England,
 called 
Patronage Pa∣ramount

over all the Ecclesia∣stical


Benefices in 
England;
 so
that if the mean Patron as afore∣said
present not in due time,
nor the Ordinary, nor Metro∣politan,
the Right of Presen∣tation
comes to the King, be∣yond
whom it cannot go. The
King is Lord Paramount, Su∣preme
Landlord of all the
Lands of 
England,
 and all
landed men are mediately or
immediately his Tenants by
some Tenure or other, for no
man in 
England
 but the King
hath 
Allodium, Directum Domi∣num,

the sole and independent
Property or Domain in any
Land, He that hath the Fee the

Jus perpetuum
 and 
Utile Domi∣nium,

is obliged to a duty to his
Soveraign for it; so it is not sim∣ply
his own, he must swear fe∣alty
to some Superiour.



The King is 
Summus totius
Regni Anglicani Justitiarius,

Supreme Judge, or Lord Chief
Justice of all 
England.
 He is
the Fountain from whence all
Justice is derived, no Subject
having here as in 
France, Haute
moyenne & basse Justice.
 He
only hath the Soveraign power
in the Administration of Ju∣stice,
and in the Execution of
the Law, and whatsoever pow∣er
is by him committed to o∣thers,
the 
dernier resort
 is still
remaining in himself; so that
he may sit in any Court, and
take Cognisance of any Cause
(as antiently Kings sate in the
Court now called the 
Kings
Bench, Henry
 the Third in
his 
Court of Exchequer,
 and

Hen.
 7. and King 
James
 some∣times
in the 
Star-Chamber)
 ex∣cept


in Felonies, Treasons,

&c.
 wherein the King being
Plaintiff and so Party, he sits
not personally in Judgement,
but doth performe it by Dele∣gates.


From the King of 
England

there lies no 
Appeal
 in 
Ecclesi∣astical
Affairs
 to the 
Bishop of
Rome,
 as it doth in other prin∣cipal
Kingdoms of 
Europe,
 nor
in 
Civil
 Affairs to the 
Emperour,

as in some of the 
Spanish
 and o∣ther
Dominions of Christen∣dom;
nor in either to the Peo∣ple
of 
England
 (as some of late
have dreamt) who in them∣selves,
or by their Representa∣tives
in the House of Com∣mons
in Parliament, were ever

Subordinate
 and never 
Superiour,

nor so much as 
Co-ordinate
 to
the King of 
England.



The King being the onely
Soveraign and Supreme Head,
is furnisht with plenary Power
Prerogative and Jurisdiction to
render Justice to every Member
within his Dominions; where∣as
some Neighbour Kings do
want a full power to do Justice
in all Causes to all their Sub∣jects,
or to punish all Crimes
committed within their own
Dominions especially in 
Causes
Ecclesiastical.


In a word,
 Rex Angliae nemi∣nem
habet in suis Dominiis Supe∣riorem
nec Parem sed omnes sub
illo, ille sub nullo nisi tantùm sub
Deo, a quo secundus, post quem
primus, ante omnes & super om∣nes
(in suis ditionibus) Deos &
Homines.



The Title of 
Dii
 or 
Gods,

plurally is often in Holy Writ
by God himself attributed to
Great Princes, because as Gods
Vicars or 
Vice-dei
 upon Earth,
they represent the Majesty and
Power of the God of Heaven
and Earth: and to the end that
the people might have so much
the higher 
esteem
 and more re∣verend

awfulness
 of them; for
if that fails, all 
Order
 fails; and
thence all 
Impiety
 and 
Calamity

follows.


The Substance of the Titles
of God was also used by the
Antient Christian Emperours,
as 
Divinitas nostra & Aeterni∣tas
nostra, &c.
 as imperfectly
and analogically in them, though
essentially and perfectly only in
God; and the good Christians


of those times out of their ex∣cess
of respect, were wont to
swear by the Majesty of the
Emperour (as 
Joseph
 once by
the life of 
Pharaoh)
 and 
Vege∣
ius

a learned Writer of that
Age seems to justifie it; 
Nam
Imperatori
 (saith he) 
tanquam
praesenti & corpoarli Deo fidelis
est praestanda Divotio & pervi∣gil
impendendus famulatus; De

enim servimus cum fideliter di∣ligimus
cum, qui Deoregnat Au∣tore.


So the Laws of 
England

looking upon the King as 
a
God upon earth,
 do attribute
unto him divers excellencies
that belong properly to God
alone, as Justice in the Ab∣stract;

Rex Angliae non potest
cuiquam injuriam facere.
 So al∣so
Infallibility, 
Rex Angliae non


potest errare.
 And as God is
perfect, so the Law will have
no Imperfection found in the
King.


No Negligence or Laches,
no Folly, no Infamy, no stain
or corruption of blood; for by
taking of the Crown all for∣mer
though just Attainders, and
that by Act of Parliament i


ipso facto
 pu
ged. No Nonage
or Minority, for his Grant of
Lands, though held in his Na∣tural
not Politick Capacity,
cannot be avoided by Nonage▪
Higher than this the Law at∣tributeth
a kind of immortali∣ty
to the King, 
Rex Angliae
non moritur;
 his Death is in
Law termed the 
Demise
 of the
King, because thereby the
Kingdom is demised to ano∣ther:
He is said not subject to


Death, because he is a Corpo∣ration
in himself that liveth for
ever, all 
Interregna
 being in

England
 unknown, the same
moment that one King dies,
the next Heir is King fully and
absolutely without any Corona∣tion,
Ceremony, or Act to be
done 
ex post facto.


Moreover, the Law seem∣eth
to attribute to the King a
certain 
Omnipresency,
 that the
King is in a manner every
where, in all his 
Courts of Ju∣stice,

and therefore cannot be

non-suited
 (as Lawyers speak)
in all his 
Palaces,
 and therefore
all Subjects stand bare in the

Presence Chamber,
 wheresoever
the 
Chair of State
 is placed,
though the King be many
miles distant from thence. He
hath a kind of universal 
influ∣ence



over all his Dominions, e∣very
soul within his Territories
may be said to feel at all times
his 
Power
 and his 
Goodness, Om∣nium
Domos Regis Vigilia de∣fendit,
Omnium Otium illius
Labor, Omnium Delicias illius
Industria, Omnium vacationem
illius Occupatio, &c.


So a kind of 
Omnipotency,

that the King can as it were
raise men from death to life, by
pardoning whom the Law hath
condemned; can 
create
 to the
highest Dignity and 
annihilate

the same at pleasure.


Divers other semblances of
the 
Eternal Deity
 belong to
the King. He in his own Do∣minions
(as God) saith 
Vin∣dicta
est mihi,
 for all punish∣ments
do proceed from him in
some of his Courts of Justice,


and it is not lawful for any Sub∣
ect
to revenge himself.


So he onely can be Judge in
his own Cause, though he de∣
ver
his Judgement by the
Mouth of his Judges.


And yet there are some

hings that the King of 
Eng∣land

cannot do. 
Rex Angliae

ihil injuste potest,
 and the King
cannot devest himself or his
Successors of any part of his

Regal Power, Prerogative,
 and

Authority
 inherent and annext
to the Crown: not that there

s any defect in the Kings Pow∣er
(as there is none in Gods
Power, though he cannot lie,
nor do any thing that implies
Contradiction:) not but that
the King of 
England
 hath as ab∣solute
a power over all his Sub∣
ects
as any 
Christian Prince


rightfully,
 and 
lawfully
 hath o

ever had: not but that he still
hath a kind of 
Omnipotency
 no

to be disputed, but adored by
his Subjects; 
Nemo quidem 

factis ejus praesumat disputar

(saith 
Bracton) multo minu

contra factum ejus ire, nam d

Chartis & Fact is ejus non deben

ne
 possunt Justiciarii mult

minus privatae personae dispu∣tare.

Not but that the King
may do what he please, with∣out
either 
opposition
 or 
resist∣ance,

and without being que∣stioned
by his Subjects; for the
King cannot be 
impleaded
 for
any Crime; no 
Action
 lieth a∣gainst
his Person, because the

Writ
 goeth forth in his own
Name, and he cannot arrest
himself. If the King should
seize his Subjects Lands (which


God forbid) or should take a∣way
his Goods, having no
Title by Law so to do, there
is no remedy. Onely this,

Locus erit
 (saith the same 
Bra∣cton)
supplicationi quod factum
suum corrigat & emendet, quod
quidem si non fecerit, sufficit ei

d paenam quod Dominum Dèum
expectet Vltorem.
 There may
be Petitions and Supplications
made that His Majesty will be
pleased to rule according to
Law, which if he shall refuse
to do, it is sufficient that he
must expect that the King of
Kings will be the Avenger of
Oppressed Loyal Subjects.


But there are also divers
things which the King cannot
do, 
Salvo jure, Salvo Juramen∣to,
& Salvâ Conscientia sua.

Because by Oath at his Coro∣nation,


and indeed without a∣ny
Oath, by the Law of 
Na∣ture,
Nations,
 and of 
Christia∣nity;

he holds himself bound
(as do all other Christian
Kings) to protect and defend
his people, to do justice and to
shew mercy, to preserve Peace
and Quietness amongst them,
to allow them their just Rights
and Liberties, to consent to
the Repealing of bad Laws,
and to the Enacting of good
Laws. Two things especially
the King of 
England
 doth not
usually do without the consent
of his Subjects, 
viz. make
New Laws,
 and 
raise New
Taxes,
 there being something
of 
Odium
 in both of them;
the one seeming to diminish
the Subjects Liberty, and the
other his Property; therefore


that all occasion of disaffecti∣on
towards the King (the
Breath of our Nosthrils and the
Light of our Eyes, as he is sti∣led)
might be avoided, it was
most wisely contrived by our
Ancestors that for both these
should Petitions and Supplica∣tions
be first made by the Sub∣ject.


These and divers other Pre∣rogative
rightfully belong and
are enjoyed by the King of 
Eng∣land.


Nevertheless the Kings of

England
 usually govern this
Kingdom by the ordinary
known 
Laws
 and 
Customs
 of
the Land (as the great God
doth the World by the Laws
of Nature) yet in some Cases
for the benefit not damage of
this Realm, they make use of


their 
Prerogatives,
 as the King
of Kings doth of his Extraor∣dinary
Power of Working of

Miracles.


Lastly, To the Kings of

England quatenus
 Kings, doth
appertain one 
Prerogative
 that
may be stiled 
super-excellent
 if
not 
miraculous,
 which was first
enjoyed by that pious and
good King 
Edward
 the 
Confes∣sor,

which is by the touch to
remove and to cure the 
Struma,

that stubborn disease, com∣monly
called the 
Kings Evil.


In consideration of these
and other transcendent Ex∣cellencies,

 no King in Chri∣stendom
nor other Potentate
receives from his Subjects more

Reverence, Honour,
 and 
Re∣spect,

than the King of 
Eng∣land.



All his People at their
first Addresses 
kneel
 to him,
he is at all times served upon
the 
Knee,
 all Persons (not the
Prince or other Heir Apparant
excepted) 
stand bare
 in the pre∣sence
of the King and in the
Presence Chamber, though in
the Kings absence. Only it
was once indulged by Queen

Mary
 for some eminent services
performed by 
Henry Ratcliffe
Earl
 of 
Sussex
 that (by Pa∣tent)
he might at any time be

covered
 in her presence; but
perhaps in imitation of the like
liberty allowed by King 
Philip

her Husband and other Kings
of 
Spain
 to some of the prin∣cipal
Nobility there called

Grandees
 of 
Spain.


Any thing or Act done in
the Kings Presence is presumed


to be void of all deceit and evil
meaning; and therefore a 
Fine

levied in the Kings Court,
where the King is presumed to
be present, doth bind a 
Feme
Covert,
 a married Woman and
others whom ordinarily the
Law doth disable to transact.


The Kings only Testimony
of any thing done in his pre∣sence
is of as high a nature and
credit as any 
Record,
 and in all

Writs
 sent forth for dispatch of
Justice, he useth no other
Witness but himself, 
viz. Te∣ste
me ipso.








Of the Kings Succes∣sion
to the Crown of
ENGLAND.


THe King of 
England

hath right to the Crown
by 
Inheritance
 and the 
Laws

and 
Customs
 of 
England.


Upon the Death of the
King, the next of Kindred,
though born out of the Domi∣nions
of 
England,
 or born of
Parents not Subjects of 
Eng∣land;

as by the Law and many
Examples in the English Histo∣ries
it doth manifestly appear:
is and is immediately King be∣fore
any Proclamation, Coro∣nation,
Publication, or Con∣sent
of Peers or People.



The Crown of 
England
 de∣scends
from Father to Son and
to his Heirs, for want of Sons
to the Eldest Daughter and her
Heirs, for want of Daughters
to the Brother and his Heirs,
and for want of Brother to the
Sister and her Heirs. The 
Sa∣lique
Law
 or rather Custom of

France,
 hath here no more
force than it had anciently a∣mong
the 
Jews,
 or now in

Spain
 and other Christian He∣reditary
Kingdoms. Among

Turks
 and 
Barbarians
 that

French
 Custom is still and ever
was in use.


In Case of descent of the
Crown (contrary to the Cu∣stom
of the descent of Estates
among Subjects) the 
Half
Blood
 shall inherit; so from
King 
Edward
 the Sixth the


Crown and Crown Lands de∣scended
to Queen 
Mary
 of the
half blood, and again to Queen

Elizabeth
 of the half blood to
the last Possessor.


At the death of every King
die not only the Offices of the
Court, but all Commissions
granted to the Judges 
durante
beneplacito;
 and of all Justices
of Peace.


If the King be likely to leave
his Crown to an Infant,
 he
doth usually by 
Testament
 ap∣point
the person or persons
that shall have the tuition of
him; and sometimes for want
of such appointment, a fit per∣son
of the Nobility or Bishops
is made choice of by the Three
States assembled in the name
of the Infant King, who by


Nature or Alliance hath most
Interest in the preservation of
the Life and Authority of the
Infant, and to whom least be∣nefit
can accrue by his Death
or Diminution; as the 
Uncle

by the 
Mothers
 side, if the
Crown come by the 
Father,

and so 
vice versa,
 is made

Protector;
 so during the mino∣rity
of 
Edward
 6. his Uncle
by the Mothers side the 
Duke
of Somerset
 had the tuition of
him, and was called Protector:
and when this Rule hath not
been observed (as in the mino∣rity
of 
Edw. 5.)
 it hath proved
of ill consequence.


If the King of 
England
 be

Non compos mentis,
 or by rea∣son
of an incurable disease,
weakness, or old age, become


uncapable of governing, then
is made a 
Regent, Protector,
 or

Guardian,
 to govern.


King 
Edward
 3. being at last
aged, sick, and weak, and by
grief for the death of the

Black Prince,
 sore broken in
body and mind, did of his
own will create his fourth Son

John
 Duke of 
Lancaster
 Guar∣dian
or Regent of 
England.


If the King be 
absent
 upon
any Foreign Expedition or o∣therwise
(which antiently was
very usual) the Custom was to
constitute a 
Vice-gerent
 by
Commission under the 
Great
Seal,
 giving him several Titles
and Powers according as the
necessity of affairs have requi∣red;
sometimes he hath been
called 
Lord Warden
 or 
Lord



of the Kingdom, and therewith
hath had the general power of
a King, as was practised du∣ring
the 
Absence
 of 
Edward
 the

First, Second,
 and 
Third,
 and
of 
Henry
 5. but 
Henry
 6. to
the Title of Warden or Guar∣dian
added the Stile of 
Prote∣ctor

of the 
Kingdom
 and of the

Church
 of 
England;
 and gave
him so great power in his 
ab∣sence,

that he was 
tantum non
Rex
 swaying the 
Scepter,
 but
not wearing the 
Crown;
 execu∣ting
Laws, summoning Parli∣aments
under his own 
Teste
 as
King, and giving his assent to
Bills in Parliament, whereby
they became as binding as any
other Acts.


Sometimes during the Kings

Absence
 the Kingdom hath
been committed to the care of


several 
Noblemen
 and some∣time
of 
Bishops,
 as less dange∣rous
for attempting any usur∣pation
of the Crown; some∣times
to one Bishop, as 
Hubert

Archbishop of 
Canterbury
 was
Viceroy of 
England
 for many
years, and when 
Edward
 3. was
in 
Flanders
 (though his Son
then but nine years old, had the
Name of 
Protector) John Staf∣ford

Archbishop of 
Canterbury

was Governour both of the
Kings Son and of the Realm.


Lastly, Sometimes to the
Queen, as two several times
during the absence of 
Henry
 8.
in 
France.








Of the QUEEN of
ENGLAND.


THe 
Queen
 so called from
the Saxon 
Konigin,

whereof the last syllable is
pronounced as 
gheen
 in En∣glish,
it being not unusual to
cut off the first Syllables, as an

Almes-House
 is sometimes cal∣led
a 
Spital
 from 
Hospital.


She hath as high Preroga∣tives,
Dignity, and State,
during the life of the King, as
any Queen of 
Europe.


From the 
Saxon
 times the
Queen 
Consort
 of 
England,

though she be an 
Alien
 born,
and though during the life of


the King she be 
femme covert

(as our Law speaks) yet with∣out
any Act of Parliament for

Naturalization
 or Letters Pa∣
ents
for 
Denization,
 she may
purchase Lands in 
Feesimple,

make Leases and Grants in her
own Name without the King;
hath power to give, to sue, to
contract, as a 
femme sole
 may
receive by gift from her Hus∣band,
which no other 
femme

overt
 may do.


Had anciently a Revenue of

Queen Gold
 or 
Aurum Reginae,

as the Records call it, which
was the tenth part of so much
as by the Name of 
Oblata
 up∣on
Pardons, Gifts, and Grants,

&c.
 came to the King.


Of later times hath had as
large a Dower as any Queen in
Christendome, hath her Royal


Court apart, her Courts and
Officers, 
&c.


The Queen may not be 
im∣pleaded

till first petitioned,
shall not be 
amerced,
 if she be

nonsuited
 as all other Subjects
are; if she be 
Plaintiff,
 the
Summons in the Process need
not have the solemnity of 15
dayes, 
&c.


Is reputed the Second Per∣son
in the Kingdom.


The Law setteth so high a
value upon her as to make it
High Treason to conspire her
death, or to violate her Cha∣stity.


Her Officers, as 
Attourney

and 
Sollicitor,
 for the Queens
sake have respect above others,
and place within the 
Barre
 with
the Kings Council.



The like honour, the like re∣verence
and respect that is due
to the King, is exhibited to
the Queen both by Subjects
and Foreigners, and also to the
Queen 
Dowager
 or Widdow
Queen, who also above other
Subjects loseth not her Digni∣ty,
though she should marry a
private Gentleman; so Queen

Katharine,
 Widdow to King

Henry
 the Fifth, being married
to 
Owen ap Theodore
 Esquire, did
maintain her Action as Queen
of 
England;
 much less doth a
Queen by 
inheritance,
 or a
Queen 
Soveraign
 of 
England,

follow her Husbands condition,
nor is subject as other Queens;
but Soveraign to her own Hus∣band,
as Queen 
Mary
 was to
King 
Philip.








Of the SONS and
DAUGHTERS of
ENGLAND.


THe Children of the King
of 
England
 are called
the 
Sons and Daughters of Eng∣land,

because all the subjects
of 
England
 have a special inte∣rest
in them, though the whole
power of Education, Marriage,
and disposing of them is only in
the King.


The Eldest Son of the King
is born Duke of 
Cornwall,
 and
as to that Dutchy, and all the
Lands, Honours, Rents, and
great Revenues belonging
thereunto, he is upon his Birth∣day


persumed and by law ta∣ken
to be of full age, so that
he may that day sue for the

Livery
 of the said Dukedom,
and ought of right to obtain
the same, as if he had been
full 21 years of age. After∣wards
he is created 
Prince of
Wales,
 whose 
Investiture
 is
performed by the Imposition
of a 
Cap of Estate
 and 
Coronet

on his Head, as a Token of
Principality, and putting into
his Hand a 
Verge
 of 
Gold,
 the
Emblem of Government, and
a 
Ring
 of Gold on hs Finger,
to intimate that he must be a
Husband to his Countrey and
Father to her Children. Also
to him is given and granted
Letters Patents to hold the
said Principality to him and his
Heirs Kings of 
England,
 by


which words the separation of
this Principality is prohibited.


From the day of his Birth he
is commonly stiled the 
Prince,

a Title in 
England
 given to no
other Subject. The Title of
Prince of 
Wales
 is ancient and
was first given by King 
Edward

1. to his Eldest Son; for the

Welsh
 Nation till that time un∣willing
to submit to the yoke
of strangers, that King so or∣dered
that his Queen was deli∣vered
of her first Child in 
Ca∣ernarvan
Castle
 in 
Wales,
 and
then demanded of the Welsh,

If they would be content to subject
themselves to one of their own
Nation, that could not speak one
word of English, and against
whose life they could take no just
exception.
 Whereunto they


readily consenting, the King
nominated this his new born
Son, and afterwards created
him Prince of 
Wales,
 and be∣stowed
on him all the Lands,
Honours, and Revenues be∣longing
to the said Principa∣lity.


The Prince hath ever since
been stiled Prince of 
Wales,

Duke of 
Aquitaine
 and 
Corn∣wall,

and Earl of 
Chester
 and

Flint,
 which Earldomes are al∣wayes
conferred upon him by
his Patent, since the Union of

England
 and 
Scotland
 his Title
hath been 
Magnae Britanniae
Princeps,
 but more ordinarily
the Prince of 
Wales.
 As El∣dest
Son to the King of 
Scot∣land

he is Duke of 
Rothsay
 and
Seneschal of 
Scotland
 from his
Birth.



The King of 
Englands
 El∣dest
Son (so long as 
Norman∣dy

remained in their hands) was
alwayes stiled Duke of 
Nor∣mandy.


Antiently the Princes of

Wales
 whilest they were Sove∣raigns
bare 
quarterly Gules
 and

Or 4 Lyons passant gardant
counterchanged.


The Arms of the Prince of

Wales
 differ from those of the
King only by addition of a 
La∣bell

of three points, and the

Device
 of the Prince is a 
Coro∣net

beautified with three 
Ost∣rich

Feathers, inscribed with

Ich dien,
 which in the German
or old Saxon Tongue is 
I serve,

alluding perhaps to that in the

Gospel, The Heir whilest his
Father liveth differeth not from a


Servant.
 This Device was
born at the Battel of 
Cressy
 by

John
 King of 
Bohcmia,
 as ser∣ving
there under the King of
the French, and there slain by

Edward
 the 
Black Prince,
 and
since worn by the Princes of

Wales,
 and by the 
Vulgar
 cal∣led
the Princes Arms.


The Prince by our Law is
reputed as the same Person
with the King,
 and so declared
by a Statute of 
Henry 8. Cor∣ruscat
enim Princeps
 (say our
Lawyers) 
radiis Regis Patris
sui & censetur una persona cum
ipso.
 And the Civilians say
the Kings Eldest Son may be
stiled a King.


He hath certain Priviledges
above other Persons.



To 
imagine
 the death of the
Prince, to 
violate
 the Wife of
the Prince is made High Trea∣son.


Hath heretofore had privi∣ledge
of having a 
Purveyor

and taking 
Purveyance,
 as the
King.


To retain and qualifie as ma∣ny

Chaplains
 as he shall please.


To the Prince at the Age of
15 is due a certain 
Aid
 of Mo∣neys
from all the Kings Te∣nants
and all that hold of him
in 
Capite,
 by 
Knight Service,

and 
Free Socage,
 to make him
a Knight.


Yet as the Prince in nature
is a distinct person from the
King, so in Law also in some
cases, He is a Subject, hold∣eth
his Principalities and Seig∣nories
of the King, giveth the


same respect to the King as o∣ther
Subjects do.


The Revenues belonging to
the Prince,
 since much of the
Lands and Demesnes of that
Dutchy have been aliened;
are especially out of the 
Tinne
Mines
 in 
Cornwall,
 which with
all other profits of that Dutchy
amount yearly to the summe
of


The Revenues of the Prin∣cipality
of 
Wales
 surveyed 200
years ago was above 4680 
l.

yearly, a rich Estate according
to the value of Money in those
dayes.


At present his whole Reve∣nues
may amount to


Till the Prince come to be
14 years old, all things be∣longing


to the Principality o


Wales
 were wont to be disposed
of by Commissioners consisting
of some principal Persons of the
Clergy and Nobility.


The 
Cadets
 or younger Son
of 
England,
 are 
created
 no

born Dukes or Earls of what
Places or Titles the King plea∣seth.


They have no certain 
Appa∣nages

as in 
France,
 but onely
what the good pleasure of the
King bestows upon them.


All the Kings Sons are 
Consi∣lii
nati,
 by Birth-right Coun∣sellors
of 
State,
 that so they
may grow up in the weighty af∣fairs
of the Kingdom.


The Daughters of 
England

are stiled Princesse, the eldest
of which have an Aid or cer∣tain


rate of Money paid by e∣very
Tenant in Capite, Knight
Service, and Soccage, to∣wards
her Dowry or Marriage
Portion.


To all the Kings Children
belong the Title of 
Royal
Highness,
 All Subjects are to
be 
uncovered
 in their presence,
to 
kneel
 when they are admit∣ted
to 
kiss
 their hands, and at
Table they are 
(out of the
Kings Presence)
 served on the

Knee.


The Children, the Brothers
and Sisters of the King, if 
Plain∣tiffs,

the summons in the Pro∣cess
need not have the solemni∣ty
of 15 dayes, as in Case of
other Subjects.


The 
Natural
 or 
Illegitimate

Sons and Daughters of the
King after they are acknow∣ledged


by the King take prece∣dence
of all the Nobles under
those of the Blood Royal.


They bear what Surname
the King pleaseth to give them,
and for Arms the Arms of 
Eng∣land

with a Bend Sinister bor∣der
Gobionnee, or some other
mark of illegitimation. Some
Kings of 
England
 have ac∣knowledged
many, and had
more illegitimate Sons and
Daughters.


King 
Henry
 the First had no
fewer than sixteeen illegitimate
Children.


Henry
 the Eighth amongst
others had one by 
Elizabeth
Blount,
 named 
Henry Fitzroy,

created by him Duke of 
Somer∣set

and 
Richmond
 Earl of 
Not∣ingham,

and Lord High 
Admi∣ral

of 
England, Ireland,
 and 
Aqui∣tain.








OF
THE PRESENT
KING
OF
ENGLAND.


THe King now raigning
is 
CHARLES
 the
Second of that Name.

His Name of Baptisme 
Charles

in the German Tongue signi∣fies
one of a Masculine strength
or vertue.



The Royal and also the most
princely and antient Families
of 
Europe
 at this day have pro∣perly
no 
Surnames,
 for neither
is 
Burbon
 the Surname, but
the Title of the Royal Family
of 
France,
 nor 
Austria
 of

Spain,
 nor 
Stuart
 of 
England,

since the coming in of King

James;
 nor 
Theodore
 or 
Tudor

for his 5 immediate Ancestors
in 
England,
 nor 
Plantagenet
 for
11 Generations before, as
some vainly think; for al∣though

Geffery
 Duke of 
Anjou

was surnamed 
Plantagenet
 from
a 
Broom Stalk
 commonly worn
in his Bonnet, yet his Son 
H.
 2.
King of 
England
 was surnamed

Fitz-empresse,
 and his Son

Richard Coeur de Lion:
 So 
Owen

Grandfather to King 
Henry
 7.


was 
ap Meredith,
 and he 
ap
Theodore,
 pronounc'd 
Tyder;

Surnames being then but little
in use amongst the 
Cambrobri∣tans.

So 
Walter
 Father to 
Ro∣bert

King of 
Scotland,
 from
whom our present King is de∣scended,
was only by Office

Grand Seneschal.
 or 
High Stew∣ard,

or 
Stuart
 of 
Scotland,

though of later times by a long
vulgar errour it hath so prevail∣ed,
that they are accounted Sur∣names
of many Families de∣scended
from him.


Steward
 is a Contraction
from the 
Saxon
 word 
Stede∣ward,

that is in Latine 
Locum∣tenens,

in French 
Lieu-tenant;

because the Lord High Stew∣ard
was 
Regis Locum tenens,
 a
Name not unfit for any King,
who is 
Dei Locum tenens,
 Gods


Stuart or Lieutenant or Vice∣gerent
upon Earth.


The King now raigning is
Son to King 
Charles
 the Mar∣tyr
and the Princess 
Henretta
Maria,
 Daughter of King

Henry
 the 
Great
 of 
France;

from which two Royal Stocks
he hath in his Veins all the
Royal Blood of 
Europe
 concen∣tred.


Is descended lineally and
lawfully from the 
British, Sax∣on,
Danish, Norman,
 and 
Scot∣tish

Kings and Princes of this
Island.


From the first 
British
 King
the 139th Monarch, from the

Scottish
 in a continued Successi∣on
for almost 2000 years the
109th, from the 
Saxon
 the
46th, and from the first of the



Norman
 Line the 26th King.
So that for Royal Extraction
and long Line of just Descent,
his Majesty now raigning ex∣cells
all the Monarchs of all
the Christian, if not of the
whole, World.


Is the first Prince of 
Great
Britain so born,
 and hath in pos∣session

larger
 Dominions than
any of his Ancestors.


He was born the 29th of
 May
1630.
 
at the Royal Palace of St.
James,
 over which House the
same day at Noon was by
thousands seen a star, and soon
after the Sun suffered an E∣clipse,
a sad presage as some
then divined that this Princes
Power should for some time
be eclipsed; and some subject


signified by a star, should have
extraordinary splendor.


Was 
christened
 the 27th

June
 following by the then
Bishop of 
London
 Doctor

Land.


Had for Godfathers his two
Uncles 
Lewis
 the 13th King
of 
France,
 and 
Frederick
 Prince

Palatine
 of the 
Rhine,
 then
called King of 
Bohemia,
 re∣presented
by the Duke of 
Rich∣mond

and Marquiss 
Hamilton;

his Godmother being his
Grandmother, then Queen
Mother of 
France,
 represented
by the Dutchesse of 
Rich∣mond.


Had for Governess 
Mary

Countess of 
Dorset,
 Wife to

Edward
 Earl of 
Dorset.
 In 
May

1638 he was first knighted, and


immediately after he was made
Knight of the Garter, and in∣stalled
at 
Windsor.


About this time by Order,

not Creation, he was first cal∣led
Prince of 
Wales,
 and had
all the profits of that Princi∣pality,
and divers other lands
annexed, and Earldom of 
Che∣ster

granted unto him, and
held his Court apart from the
King.


At the Age of Eight he had
for 
Governour
 the Earl,
 after∣wards
Marquiss, and now Duke
of 
Newcastle,
 and for Tutor
or 
Preceptor
 Doctor 
Duppa,

then Dean of 
Christchurch,
 af∣ter
Bishop of 
Salisbury,
 and
lately of 
Winchester.



At the Age of 12 was with
the King his Father at the 
Bat∣tel

of 
Edge-hill,
 and soon af∣ter
at 
Oxford
 was committed
to the care of the Marquiss of

Hertford.


About 14 years old was in
the Head of an Army in the
West of 
England.


At the Age of 15 a Marri∣age
was proposed between him
and the Eldest Daughter of the
King of 
Portugal,
 the 
Infanta
Joanna,
 since deceased.


Two years after was from

Cornwall
 transported to the Isle
of 
Scilly,
 and after to 
Jersey,

and thence to his Royal Mo∣ther
to St. 
Germains
 near

Paris.


In 1648 was at 
Sea
 with some
Naval Forces, endeavouring
to rescue the King his Father,


then in the Isle of 
Wight,
 out
of the wicked hands of his re∣bellious
Subjects. Not many
moneths after, upon the sad
News of the horrid 
Murther
 of
his Royal Father, he was in

Holland
 first saluted 
King,
 and
soon after proclaimed in 
Scot∣land,

being not yet 19 years
of Age.


At the Age of 20 from 
Hol∣land

he landed in 
Scotland,
June
 1650, and in 
Janua∣ry

following was crowned at

Scoon.


The 3d of 
September
 1651
fought the 
Battel
 of 
Worcester,

whence after the unfortunate
loss of his whole Army, wan∣dring
in disguise about 
England

for 
six weeks,
 he was at length
transported from a Creek near

Shoram
 in 
Sussex
 to 
Fecam
 near



Havre de Grace
 in 
France;
 in
which Kingdom, with his Roy∣al
Brothers, and divers English
Nobility, Clergy and Gentry,
he was for some years received
and treated as King of 
England,

and by his mediations and inte∣rest
with the Prince of 
Conde

and Duke of 
Lorraine,
 then
in the Head of two great and
mighty Armies against the

French
 King, quenched the
then newly kindled fires of a
great and universal rebellion a∣gainst
him, much resembling
that of 
England;
 and was a
means of recalling the then
fled and banished Cardinal 
Ma∣zarine:

After which in 
Ger∣many,
Flanders, Spain, &c.

he passed the residue of his
time in the Studies and Exer∣cises
most befitting a Prince,


in solliciting the Aid of Chri∣stian
Princes, and in advising
and vigorously promoting the
several attempts of his Friends
in 
England;
 until the year 1660,
at which time being at 
Brussells

within the 
Spanish
 Territories,
and perceiving a general incli∣nation
and disposition of all

England
 to receive him, he
providently removed himself
to 
Breda,
 within the Dominions
of the 
United Netherlands,
 in
the moneth of 
April,
 and thence
in 
May
 to the 
Hague;
 from
whence, after a magnificent
Entertainment and an humble
Invitation by English Commis∣sioners
sent from the then Con∣vention
at 
Westminster,
 he em∣barkt
at 
Schevling
 the 23th of

May
 1660, and with a gallant
English Fleet and a gentle gale


of Wind, landed the 25th at

Dover,
 and on the 29th follow∣ing,
being his Birth-day, and
then just 30 years of Age,
he entred into 
London,
 and
was there received with the
greatest and most universal
Joy and Acclamations and
Magnificence that could pos∣sibly
be expressed on so short a
warning.


On the first of 
June
 follow∣ing
His Majesty fate in 
Parlia∣ment,

and on the 22th of 
A∣pril

1661 rode in triumph from
the 
Tower
 to 
Westminster;
 on
the next day, being St. 
Georges,

was crowned with great Cere∣mony.


On the 28th of 
May
 follow∣ing
declared to his Parliament
his Resolution to marry the 
In∣fanta

of 
Portugal,
 who accor∣dingly


in 
May
 1662, being
landed at 
Portsmouth
 was there
espoused to the King by the
then Bishop of 
London,
 now
Archbishop of 
Canterbury.






Of the present Queen
of England.


DONNA CATHERI∣NA
Infanta of Portu∣gal

being Queen Con∣sort
of 
England,
 and the Se∣cond
Person in the Kingdom,
was Daughter of Don 
Juan

the Fourth of that Name, King
of 
Portugal,
 descended from
our English 
John
 of 
Gaunt,

Duke of 
Lancaster
 and King of

Castile,
 and 
Jean
 Fourth Son
of 
Edward
 the third King of



England,
 and of 
Donna Lucia

Daughter of 
Don Guzman el
bueno
 a Spaniard, Duke of

Medina Sidonia,
 who was line∣ally
descended from 
Ferdinando
de la Cerde
 and his Consort

Blanche,
 to whom St. 
Lewis

King of 
France
 her Father re∣linquisht
his Right and Title to

Spain,
 descended to him by
his Mother 
Blanche,
 eldest
Daughter and Heir of 
Alphon∣so

the Spanish King.


She was born the 14th of

November
 1638 at 
Villa Vicosa

in 
Portugal,
 she was baptized

Catherina,

The Fifth 
Great Officer
 of
the Crown is the Lord 
Great
Chamberlain
 of

 an
Officer of great Antiquity, to

and certain Fees due from each

Basin
 and

&c.


This Honour was long en∣joyed
by the Earls of 
Oxford,

from the time of 
Hen.
 1. by


an 
Estate Tayle
 or 
Inheritance,

but in the two last Coronations
by the Earls of 
Lindsey,
 and
that by an Estate of Inheri∣tance
from a Daughter or Heir
General claimed and contro∣verted.


The Sixth 
Great Officer
 is
the Lord 
High Constable
 of

England.
 so called some think
from the Saxon 
Cuning,
 by con∣traction
King and Stable, 
qua∣si-Regis
columen,
 for it was anti∣ently
written 
Cuningstable,
 but
rather from 
Comes Stabuli,

whose Power and Jurisdiction
was antiently so great, that
after the death of 
Edward Bo∣hun

Duke of 
Buckingham
 1521
the last High 
Constable
 of 
Eng∣land,

it was thought too great
for any Subject.



But since upon occasion of
Coronations (as at that of
King 
Charles
 2. was made the
present Earl of 
Northumber∣land
)
and at Solemn Trials by
Combat (as at that which was
intended between 
Rey
 and 
Ram∣sey

1631, was made 
Robert

Earl of 
Lindsey
) there is created

pro hac vice
 a Lord 
High Consta∣ble.

His Power and Jurisdi∣ction
is the same with the 
Earl
Marshal,
 with whom he sits

Judge
 in the 
Marshals Court,

and takes place of the Earl

Marshal.


The Seventh 
Great Officer

of the Crown is the 
Earl Mar∣shal

of 
England,
 so called from

Mare
 in the old Saxon 
(i.e.
)
Horses, and 
Schal Praefectus.

He is an Earl some say by his



Office,
 whereby he taketh as
the Constable doth, Cogni∣sance
of all matters of 
War
 and

Arms,
 determineth 
Contracts

touching Deeds of Arms 
out
of the Realm
 upon Land, and
matters concerning 
Wars
 with∣in
the Realm, which cannot be
determined by 
Common Law.


This Office is of great Anti∣quity
in 
England,
 and antient∣ly
of great Power.


The last Earl Marshal was

Henry Howard
 Earl of 
Arundel,

who died in 1652, his Father

Thomas
 Earl of 
Arundel
 and he
enjoying that Office onely for
the Term of their lives by the
Kings Letters Patents.


At the Coronation of His
Majesty now raigning, the pre∣sent
Earl of 
Suffolk
 for that So∣lemnity
only was made 
Earl
Marshal.



The Eighth and last 
Great
Officer
 of the Crown is the
Lord 
High Steward
 of 
England,


quasi Stedeward Locum tenens

the Kings Lieftenant, in Law∣yers
Latin 
Seneschallus
 of 
Sen,

in Saxon, 
Justice,
 and 
Schals
Governour
 or 
Officer.


His Power antiently in Civil
Matters was next to the King,
and was so transcendent, that
it was thought fit not longer to
trust it in the hands of any Sub∣ject,
for his Office was 
Supervi∣dere
& regulare sub Rege & im∣mediatè
post Regem
 (as an antient
Record speaks) 
totum Regnum
Angliae & omnes ministros Le∣gum
infra idem regnum tempori∣bus
pacis & guerrarum.



The last that had a State of
Inheritance in this High Office
was 
Henry of Bullinbrook
 (Son
and Heir to the great Duke of

Lancaster John of Gaunt,
 af∣terwards
King of 
England:
)
since which time they have
been made only 
hâc vice,
 to
officiate at a Coronation, by
vertue of which Office he sit∣teth
judicially and keepeth his
Court in the Kings Palace at

Westminster,
 and there recei∣veth
the Bills and Petitions of
all such Noblemen and others,
who by reason of their Tenure
or otherwise, claim to do Servi∣ces
at the New Kings Corona∣tion,
and to receive the Fees
and Allowances due and accu∣stomed;
as lately at the 
Coro∣nation

of King 
Charles
 the Se∣cond,
the 
Duke of Ormond
 was


made for that occafion Lord

High Steward
 of 
England,
 and
(marching immediately before
the King) bore in his hands
St. 
Edwards Crown:
 Or else
for the Arraignment of some
Peer of the Realm, their
Wives or Widdows, for Trea∣son
or Felony, or some other
great Crime, to judge and give
Sentence, as the antient High
Stewards were wont to do;
which ended, his Commission
expireth: During such Tryal
he sitteth under a Cloth of E∣state,
and they that speak to
him say, 
May it please your
Grace my Lord High Steward of
England.
 His Commission is
to proceed 
Secundum Legem &
consuetudinem Angliae.
 He is
sole Judge, yet doth call all
the Twelve Judges of the


Land to assist him. Is 
not sworn,

nor the Lords who are the Try∣ers
of the Peer arraigned.


During his Stewardship he
bears a 
White Staffe
 in his Hand,
and the Tryal being over, open∣ly
breaks it, and so his Office
takes an end.






Of the Kings Court.


THe Court of the King of

England
 is a 
Monarchy

within a 
Monarchy,
 consisting
of 
Ecclesiastical, Civil,
 and

Military
 Persons and Govern∣ment.


For the Ecclesiastical Go∣vernment
of the Kings Court


there is first a 
Dean
 of the Kings
Chappel, who is usually some
grave Learned Prelate, chosen
by the King, and who as Dean
acknowledgeth no 
Superiour

but the King; for as the Kings
Palace is exempt from all infe∣riour
Temporal Jurisdiction,
so is his Chappel from all Spi∣ritual;
it is called 
Capella Do∣menica,

the 
Demean
 Chappel,
is not within the Jurisdiction or
Diocess of any Bishop, but as
a 
Regal Peculiar
 exempt and re∣served
to the Visitation and
Immediate Government of the
King, who is 
Supreme Ordina∣ry,

and as it were Prime Bi∣shop
over all the Churches and
Bishops of 
England.


By the Dean are chosen all o∣ther
Officers of the Chappel,

viz.
 a 
Subdean
 or 
Praecentor


Capellae,
 32 Gentlemen of the
Chappel, whereof 12 are

Priests,
 and one of them is

Confessor
 to the Kings Hou∣shold,
whose Office is to read
Prayers every Morning to the
Family, to visit the Sick, to
examine and prepare Commu∣nicants,
to inform such as de∣sire
advice in any Case of Con∣science
or Point of Religion,

&c.


The other 20 Gentlemen,
commonly called 
Clerks
 of the
Chappel, are with the afore∣said
Priests to perform in the
Chappel the Office of Divine
Service in 
Praying, Singing,
&c.
 One of these being well
skilled in 
Musick,
 is chosen

Master of the Children,
 where∣of
there are 12 in Ordinary,
to instruct them in the Rules


and Art of Musick for the Ser∣vice
of the Chappel. Three
other of the said Clerks are
chosen to be 
Organists,
 to
whom are joyned upon 
Sun∣dayes,
Collar
 dayes, and other

Holy-dayes,
 the 
Saickbuts
 and

Cornets
 belonging to the Kings
Private Musick, to make the
Chappel Musick more full and
compleat.


There are moreover 4 Offi∣cers
called 
Vergers,
 from the
Silver Rods carried in their
hands, also a 
Sergeant, 2 Yeo∣men;

and a 
Groom
 of the Chap∣pel.


In the Kings Chappel 
thrice

every day Prayers are read, and
Gods Service and Worship
performed with great 
Decency,
Order,
 and 
Devotion,
 and
should be a 
Pattern
 to all o∣ther


Churches and Chappels
of 
England.


Twelve dayes in the year,
being high and principal Festi∣vals,
His Majesty after Divine
Service, attended with his prin∣cipal
Nobility, adorned with
their 
Collars
 of 
Esses,
 in a grave
solemn manner at the 
Altar of∣fers

a sum of 
Gold
 to God, 
in
signum specialis dominii,
 that
by his Grace he is King, and
holdeth all of him.


All Offerings made at the
Holy Altar by the King and
the Queen, did antiently be∣long
to the disposal of the
Archbishop of 
Canterbury,
 if
his Grace were present, where∣soever
the Court was, but now
to the Dean of the Chappel.


Those 12 dayes are first

Christmass, Easter, Whitsun∣day,



and 
All Saints,
 called

Houshold-dayes,
 upon which
the 
Besant
 or 
Gold
 to be offer∣ed,
is delivered to the King by
the Lord 
Steward
 or some other
of the Principal Officers: then

New-years-day
 and 
Twelf-day,

upon the later of which 
Gold,
Frankincense,
 and 
Myrrhe,
 in
several Purses are offered by
the King: Lastly, 
Candlemas,
Anuntiation, Ascention, Trini∣ty
Sunday,
 St. 
John Baptist,

and 
Michaelmass day,
 when on∣ly

Gold
 is offered. Upon 
Christ∣mass,
Easter,
 and 
Whitsunday,

His Majesty usually receives the
Holy 
Sacrament,
 none but two
or three of the Principal Bi∣shops
communicating with
Him.


The King hath also (besides
many 
Extraordinary) 48 Chap∣lains



in 
Ordinary,
 who are u∣sually
eminent Doctors in Di∣vinity;
whereof 4 every Mo∣neth
wait at Court to preach
in the Chappel on Sundayes
and other Festivals before the
King, and in the Morning ear∣ly
on Sundayes before the Hou∣shold,
to read Divine Service
before the King out of Chap∣pel
daily twice in the Kings Pri∣vate
Oratory, to give Thanks
at Table, in the Clerk of the
Closets absence.


In time of 
Lent,
 according
to antient laudable Custom,
the Divine Service and Preach∣ing
is performed in a more so∣lemn
manner.


Antiently at Court there
were Sermons in Lent only,
and that in the Afternoon, in
the Open Court, and then only


by Bishops, Deans, and prin∣cipal
Prebends: Our Ancestors
judging that time enough and
those persons only fit to teach
such an Auditory their duty to
God and Man. Antiently al∣so
the Lent Preachers were all
appointed by the Archbishop of

Canterbury.
 Now on the first

Wednesday,
 called 
Ashwednesday,

in the Morning, begins the

Dean
 of the Chappel to preach,
and on each 
Wednesday
 after
one of his Majesties more elo∣quent

Chaplains,
 and every
Friday the 
Dean
 of some Ca∣thedral
or Collegiat Church,
and on the last 
Friday,
 called

Good Friday,
 is alwayes to
preach the 
Dean
 of 
Westmin∣ster;

and on every 
Sunday
 in

Lent
 some, 
Right Reverend Bi∣shop

preacheth, and on the last



Sunday
 of 
Lent,
 called 
Palm-Sunday,

is to preach an 
Arch∣bishop,

and upon 
Easter
 day the
Lord 
High Almoner,
 who is u∣sually
some principal Bishop,
that disposeth of the Kings

Almes,
 and for that use recei∣veth
(besides other moneys al∣lowed
by the King) all 
Deo∣dands
& Bona Felonum de se,

to be that way disposed.


In 
France
 the 
Grand Aumos∣nier

is principal of all the 
Ec∣clesiastiques

of the Court, and all
Officers of the Kings Chappel,
he receiveth their Oaths of Al∣legeance,
and himself swears
only to the King for that Of∣fice;
he hath the disposition of
all 
Hospitals,
 the Charge for
delivering Prisoners pardoned
by the King at his coming to
the Crown, or at his Corona∣tion


or first entrance into any of
his Cities.


Under the Lord High Al∣moner
there is a 
Subalmoner,

two 
Yeomen,
 and two 
Grooms
 of
the 
Almonry.


Besides all these, the King
hath a 
Clerk
 of the Closet or

Confessor
 to His Majesty, who
is commonly some reverend dis∣creet
Divine, extraordinarily
esteemed by His Majesty,
whose 
Office
 is to 
attend
 at the
Kings right hand during Divine
Service, to 
resolve
 all 
doubts

concerning spiritual matters,

&c.


The present Dean of the
Chappel is Doctor 
Herbert
Crofts
 Bishop of 
Hereford,

whose Fee is 200 
l.
 yearly and
a Table, his Subdean is Doctor

Jones,
 whose Fee is 100 
l.
 year∣ly.



The Fee of each Priest and
Clerk of the Chappel is 70 
l.

yearly.


The 
Clerk of the Closet
 is
Doctor 
Blandford
 Bishop of

Oxford,
 hath no Fee.


The Lord 
High Almoner
 is
Doctor 
Henchman Bishop
 of

London,
 hath no Fee: his 
Sub-Almoner

is Doctor 
Perinchef,

whose Fee is 6 
l. 6 s. 10 d.




Of the Civil Govern∣ment
of His Ma∣jesties
Houshold.


FOr the 
Civil
 Government
of the Kings Court, the
Chief Officer is the Lord 
Stew∣ard,
quasi Stede ward Locum
tenens,
 called also in the time
of 
Henry
 8. the 
Great Master
 of


the Kings Houshold after the
French Mode, but 
Primo Ma∣riae,

and ever since called the
Lord Steward of the Kings
Houshold.


He hath Authority over all
Officers and Servants of the
Kings House, except those of
His Majesties Chappel, Cham∣ber,
and Stable 
&c.


He judgeth of all disorders
committed in the Court, or
within the 
Verge,
 which is e∣very
way within 12 miles of the
chief Tunnel of the Court (on∣ly

London
 by Charter is ex∣empted)
for the Law having
an high esteem of the dignity
of the Kings 
settled Mansion
House,
 laid out such a Plot of
ground about his House (as a

half-pace
 or 
Foot-Carpet
 spread
about the Kings Chair of 
Estate



that ought to be more cleared
and void than other places) to
be subject to a special exempt∣ed
jurisdiction depending on the
Kings Person and Great Offi∣cers,
that so, where the King
comes, there should come with
him 
Peace
 and 
Order,
 and an

Awfulness
 and 
Reverence
 in
mens hearts, besides it would
have been a kind of eclipsing
of the Kings Honour, that
where the King was, any Ju∣stice
should be sought, but im∣mediately
from the Kings own
Officers, and therefore from
very antient times the Jurisdi∣ction
of the 
Verge
 hath been
executed by the Lord Steward
with great Ceremony in the na∣ture
of a peculiar Kings Bench,
and that not only 
within
 but

without
 the Kings Dominions;


for so it is recorded that one

Engleam
 of 
Nogent
 in 
France

for stealing 
Silver dishes
 out of
the 
House
 of 
Edward
 1. King of

England,
 then at 
Paris
 (after
the matter had been debated in
the Council of the King of

France
 touching the Jurisdicti∣on,
and ordered that the King
of 
England
 should enjoy this
Kingly Prerogative of his 
Hou∣shold
)
was condemned by Sir

Robert Fitz-John
 then Stew∣ard
to the King of 
England,

and 
hanged
 in St. 
Germans
Fields.


The Lord Steward is a 
White
Staffe
 Officer, for he in the
Kings Presence carrieth a 
White
Staffe,
 and at other times
going abroad, it is carried by a
Foot-man bare-headed. At
the death of the King, over the



Hearse
 made for the Kings Bo∣dy,
he breaketh this 
Staffe,
 and
thereby dischargeth all the Of∣ficers,
whom the succeeding
King, out of his 
meer grace
 doth
re-establish each one in his for∣mer
Office.


This eminent Emploiment
is now enjoyed by 
James Duke
of Ormond, Lord Lieftenant of
Ireland,
 whose Fee is 100 
l.

yearly, and 16 Dishes daily each
Meal, with Wine, Beer, 
&c.


The next Officer is the Lord
Chamberlain, who hath the
over-sight of all Officers be∣longing
to the Kings Chamber,
except the Precincts of the
Kings Bed-Chamber, which
is wholy under the Groom of
the Stool; and all above Stairs;
who are all sworn by him (or


his Warrant to the Gentlemen
Ushers) to the King. He hath
also the over-sight of the Of∣ficers
of the Wardrobes at all
his Majesties Houses, and of
the removing Wardr. or of
Beds, of the Tents, Revels,
Musick, Comedians, Hunt∣ing,
and of the Messengers, of
the Trumpetters, Drummers,
of all Handy-Crafts and Ar∣tisans
retained in the Kings
Service. Moreover he hath
the over-sight of the He∣raulds
and Pursivants, and Ser∣geants
at Arms, of all Physi∣tians,
Apothecaries, Surgeons,
Barbers, 
&c.
 To him also be∣longeth
the over-sight of the
Chaplains, though himself be
a Lay-man; contrary in this
particular to the Antient Cu∣stom
of 
England,
 and Modern


Custom of all other Kingdoms,
where Ecclesiastiques are never
under the ordering of Lay∣men.


The Fee of the Lord Cham∣berlain
of the 
Kings House
 is
100 
l.
 yearly, and 16 Dishes
each Meal, with all the Appur∣tenances.


This Office is now in the
hands of 
Edward Montague,

Lord 
Montague,
 and Earl of

Manchester.


Most of the above-named
Offices and Places are in the
Gift and Disposal of the Lord
Chamberlain.


The Third Great Officer of
the 
Kings Court
 is the 
Master of
the Horse,
 antiently called 
Co∣mes
Stabuli,
 or 
Constable,
 to
whom a highe
 Employment


and Power was then given, and
this taken from him.


This great Officer hath now
the ordering and disposal of all
the Kings Stables and Races of
Horses, and had heretofore of
all the Posts of 
England.
 He
hath also the power over Escui∣ries
and Pages, over the Foot∣men,
Grooms, Riders of the
Great Horses, Farriers, Smiths,
Coach-men, Sadlers, and all
other Trades working to the
Kings Stables, to all whom he
(or by his Warrant the Ave∣ner)
giveth an Oath to be true
and faithful.


He hath the Charge of all
Lands and Revenues appointed
for the Kings breed of Horses,
and for Charges of the Stable,
and for Litters, Coaches, Sum∣pter
Horses, 
&c.



Also for the Charges of
Coronations, Marriages, En∣tries,
Cavalcades, Funerals,

&c.


He only hath the 
Priviledge

to make use of any Horses, Pa∣ges,
Foot-men belonging to
the Kings Stable.


At any 
Solemn Cavalcade
 he
rides next behind the King, and
leads a 
Lear Horse of State.


This great honour is now en∣joyed
by 
George Monk
 Duke of

Albemarle,
 in consideration of
his unparalleld Services to the
King, to his Crown and Digni∣ty
at a juncture of time when
his Affairs and Friends were in
a very desperate condition.


His yearly Fee is 666 
l. 16 s.
4 d.



Under these Three Principal
Officers of His Majesties Hou∣shold
are almost all the other
Officers and Servants.


First under the Lord Steward
in the 
Compting-House
 is the
Treasurer of the Houshold.


Comptroller.


Cofferer.


Master of the Houshold.


Two Clerks of the Green-Cloth.


Two Clerks Comptrollers.


One Sergeant.


Two Yeomen.


The Cofferers Clerk.


The Groom.


Two Messengers.


It is called the 
Compting-House,

because the Accompts
for all Expences of the Kings
Houshold are there taken daily


by the Lord Steward, the
Treasurer, the Comptroller,
the Cofferer, the Master of the
Houshold, the two Clerks of
the Green Cloth, and the two
Clerks Comptrollers, who al∣so
there make Provisions for

Of the Military Go∣vernment
in the
Kings Court.


AS in a Kingdome, be∣cause
Civil Governours
proposing Temporal and Ec∣clesiastical
Governours Eter∣nal
Rewards and Punishments
are not sufficient to secure
Peace; therefore a Military
force is alwayes in readiness:
so in the Kings Court, besides
Civil and Ecclesiastical Offi∣cers,
it is thought necessary al∣wayes
to have in readiness Mi∣litary
Officers and Souldiers, to
preserve the Kings Person;
whereupon depends the Peace


and Safety of all his Subjects.


Belonging peculiarly to the
Kings Court (besides above
4000 Foot, and above 500
Horse, who are alwayes in Pay
and readiness to assist upon any
occasion) there are Guards of
Horse and Foot.


The 
Horse Guard,
 which
the French call 
Garde du Corps,

the Germans 
Lieb Guardy,
 we
corruptly. 
Life Gard,
 that is,

the Gard of the Kings Body,
 hath
consisted of 500 Horsemen, all
or most Gentlemen and old Of∣ficers,
commanded by the
Captain of the Guard, now

James
 Duke of 
Monmouth,

whose Pay is 30 
s.
 a day, and
each Horseman 4 
s.
 a day.
These Horse have been divided
into Three Parts, whereof 200
under the immediate Com∣mand


of the Captain of the
Guard, 150 under Monsieur

le Marquis de Blancfort,
 and
150 under Sir 
Philip Howard,

whose Pay to each is 20 
s.
 a
day.


Under the Captain of the
Guard are four Lieutenants,
Sir 
Thomas Sandis,
 Sir 
Gilbert
Gerard,
 Major General 
Eger∣ton,

and Sir 
George Hambleton,

the Cornet is Mr. 
Stanly,
 Bro∣ther
to the Earl of 
Derby;
 also
four Brigadeers.


The Office of the Captain
of the Life Guard is at all times
of War or Peace to wait upon
the Kings Person (as oft as he
rides abroad) with a considera∣ble
number of Horsemen well
armed and prepared against all
dangers whatsoever.



At home within the Kings
House it is thought fit that the
Kings Person should have a
Guard both above and below
Stairs.


In the Presence Chamber
therefore wait the Gentlemen
Pensioners carrying Pole-axes,
there are 50 who are usually
Knights or Gentlemen of good
Quality and Families; their
Office is to attend the Kings
Person to and from his Chappel
only as far as the Privy Cham∣ber;
also in all other Solemni∣ties:
their yearly Fee is 100 
l.

to each. Over these there is a
Captain, usually some Noble∣man,
at present the Lord 
Bellas∣sis,

whose Fee is 200 
l.
 yearly;
a Lieutenant Sir 
John Bennet,

his Fee 66 
l. 13 s. 4 d.
 a
Standard-Bearer, Fee 100 
l.
 a


Pay-masters Fee 50 
l.
 and a
Clerk of the Check.


Again in the first Room a∣bove
Stairs, called the 
Guard-Chamber,

attend the Yeomen
of the Guard, whereof there
are 250 men of the best quality
under Gentry, and of larger
Stature, wearing Red Coats,
after an Antient Mode, bearing
Halberds at home and Half-Pikes
in Progress, and alwayes
wearing a large Sword.


Their Pay is daily 2 
s. 6 d.


Their Captain the Lord,

Grandison.


The Kings Palace Royal

(ratione Regiae Dignitatis
) is ex∣empted
from all Jurisdiction of
any Court Civil or Ecclesiasti∣cal,
but only to the Lord
Steward, and in his absence to


the Treasurer and Comptroller
of the Kings Houshold, with
the Steward of the 
Marshalsey,

who may by vertue of their Of∣fice,
without Commission hear
and determine all Treasons,
Felonies, Breaches of the
Peace, committed within the
Kings Court or Palace.


The Kings Court or House
where the King resideth, is ac∣counted
a place so sacred, that
if any man presume to strike a∣nother
within the Palace where
the Kings Royal Person resi∣deth,
and by such stroke only
draw blood, his right hand
shall be stricken off, and he
committed to perpetual prison
and fined. By the Antient
Laws of 
England
 only striking
in the Kings Court was punisht
with death and loss of goods.



To make the deeper impres∣sion
and terrour into mens
minds for striking in the
Kings Court, it hath been or∣dered
that the Punishment for
striking should be executed with
great Solemnity and Ceremony,
in brief thus:


The Sergeant of the Kings
Woodyard brings to the place
of execution a square Block,
a Beetle, Staple, and Cords to
fasten the hand thereto, the
Yeoman of the Scullery pro∣vides
a great fire of Coals by
the Block, wherein the Searing
Irons brought by the Chief
Farrier, are to be ready for the
Chief Surgeon to use. Vinegar
and Cold Water brought by
the Groom of the Saucery; the
Chief Officers also of the Cel∣lar
and Pantry are to be ready,


one with a Cup of Red Wine,
and the other with a Manchet,
to offer the Criminal after the
Hand cut off and the Stump
seared. The Sergeant of the
Ewry is to bring linnen to wind
about and wrap the Arm. The
Yeoman of the Poultry a Cock
to lay to it, the Yeoman of the
Chandry seared Clothes, the
Master Cook a sharp Dresser
Knife, which at the place of
Execution is to be held upright
by the Sergeant of the Larder,
till Execution be performed by
an Officer appointed thereto,

&c.


In the Kings Court not on∣ly
striking is forbidden but also
all occasions of Striking, and
therefore the Law saith, 
Nullas
Citationes aut summonitiones li∣cet
facere infra Palatium Regis


apud Westm, vel alibi ubi Rex
residet.


The Court of the King of

England 
for Magnificence, for
Order, for Number and Qua∣lity
of Officers, for rich Furni∣ture,
for Entertainment and Ci∣vility
to Strangers, for plenti∣ful
Tables, might compare with
the best Court of
 Christendom,

and far excel the most Courts
abroad; of one whereof, see
the Description made by an in∣genious
Person beyond Sea,
writing to a Friend of his at
Court there,
 Annon in Inferno
es Amice, qui es in Aula ubi
Daemonum habitatio est, qui il∣lic
suis artibus (humanâ licet ef∣figie)
regnant, atque ubi Scele∣rum
Schola est, & Animarum
jactura ingens, ac quicquid us∣piam
est perfidiae ac doli, quic∣quid


crudelitatis ac inclementiae,
quicquid effraenatae superbiae &
rapacis avaritiae, quicquid ob∣scaenae
libidinis ac faedissimae im∣pudicitiae,
quicquid nefandae
impietatis & morum pessimorum,
totum illic acervatur cumulatis∣simè,
ubi stupra, raptus, in∣cestus
adulteria ubi inebriari
jurare pejerare Atheismum profi∣teri
palam principum & nobili∣um
ludi sunt, ubi fastus & tu∣mor,
ira Liver faedaque cupido
cum sociis suis imperare videtur,
ubi criminum omnium procellae,
virtutumque omnium inerrabile
naufragium, &c.


But the Court of 
England

on the contrary hath been (and
is hoped ever will be) accoun∣ted
(as King 
James
 adviseth in
his 
Basilicon Doron
) a 
Pattern
 of

Godliness
 and all 
Honesty
 and



Vertue,
 and the properest
School of 
Prowess
 and 
Heroick
Demeanour,
 and the fittest
Place of 
Education
 for the 
No∣bility

and 
Centry.


The Court of 
England
 hath
for a long time been a 
Pattern

of 
Hospitality
 to the 
Nobility

and 
Gentry
 of 
England.
 All
Noblemen or Gentlemen, Sub∣jects
or Strangers that came ac∣cidently
to Court, were freely
entertained at the plentiful Ta∣bles
of His Majesties Officers.
Divers Services or Messes of
Meat were every day provided
Extraordinary for the Kings ho∣nour.
Two hundred and forty
Gallons a day were at the But∣try
Barr allowed for the Poor,
besides all the broken Meat,
Bread, 
&c.
 gathered into Bas∣kets
and given to the Poor at


the Court Gates by 2 Grooms
and 2 Yeomen of the Almon∣ry,
who have Salaries of His
Majesty for that Service.


Moreover the Court is an
eminent 
Pattern
 of 
Charity
 and

Humility
 to all that shall see the
performance of that Antient
Custom by the King and the
Queen on the Thursday before

Easter,
 called 
Maundy Thursday,

wherein the King in a solemn
manner doth wash the Feet,
cloth and feed as many poor
Old Men as His Majesty is years
old, bestowing on every one
Cloth for a Gown, Linnen for
a Shirt, Shooes, and Stock∣ings,
a Joul of Salmon, a Pol
of Ling, 30 Red and 30 White
Herrings, all in clean Wooden
Dishes, 4 Six Penny Loaves of


Bread, and a Purse with a 20 
s.

Piece of Gold.


The Magnificence and abun∣dant
plenty of the Kings Ta∣bles
hath caused amazement in
all Forreigners, when they have
been informed that yearly was
spent of gross Meat 1500 Ox∣en,
7000 Sheep, 1200 Veals,
300 Porkers, 400 Sturks or
young Biefes, 6800 Lambs 300
Flitches of Bacon, and 26
Boares. Also 140 Dozen of
Geese, 250 Dozen of Capons,
470 Dozen of Hens, 750 Do∣zen
of Pullets, 1470 Dozen
of Chicken. For Bread 36400
Bushels of Wheat, and for
Drink 600 Tun of Wine and
1700 Tun of Beer. Moreo∣ver
of Butter 46640 Pounds,
together with Fish and Fowl,
Venison, Fruit, Spice, pro∣portionable.


This prodigious
plenty caused Forreigners to
put a higher value upon the
King, and caused the Natives
who were there freely welcome,
to encrease their affection to
the King, it being found as ne∣cessary
for the King of 
Eng∣land

this way to endear the
English, who ever delighted
in Feasting; as for the Italian
Princes by Sights and Shews to
endear their subjects, who as
much delight therein.

Of the Three States
of England.


ALl the Subjects of 
Eng∣land

are divided into

Clergy
 and 
Laity;
 The Laity
sub-divided into 
Nobility
 and

Commonalty.
 These are called

Ordines Regni,
 or the 
Three
States,
 and first of the Clergy.


As 
Heaven
 is more honoura∣ble
than 
Earth,
 the 
Soul
 than
the 
Body;
 so is the 
Spiritual

Function more excellent than
the 
Civil,
 and the 
Sacerdotal

Dignity higher than the 
Secu∣lar:

and therefore in 
England

the 
Clergy caeteris paribus,
 hath


ever had (according to the pra∣ctice
of all other Civilized Na∣tions
since the World began)
the preference and precedence
of the 
Laity,
 and hath in all
times been reputed the First of
the Three States.


The 
Clergy
 so called,
 because
they are Gods 
 or 
Portion:

For although all Christians may
be stiled Gods Portion as well
as Gods Servants; yet amongst
Christians those Persons whom
God hath set apart and separa∣ted
from common use to his
Service, to be as it were his
Domestick Servants; are more
peculiarly the Lords Portion:
and therefore from the first Age
of Christianity, the Persons so
set apart, have been called 
Cle∣rici,

Clerks.



As in the 
State,
 so in the

Church,
 the Laws and Consti∣tutions
of 
England
 would not
that there should be a 
parity
 and

equality
 of all persons. 
Quippe
in Ecclesia nihil magis inaequale
quam aequalitas.
 And therefore in
conformity to the first Times
and Places of Establisht 
Christi∣anity,

so soon as the 
Christian
Faith
 was by Authority recei∣ved
in 
England,
 one of the
Clergy was in every City or∣dained
a 
Bishop;
 who hath (to
avoid Confusion, which usually
springs from equality) a pre-e∣minence
over the rest of the
Clergy within certain Pre∣cincts.


Afterwards the Bishops be∣ing
necessitated to meet about
Publick Affairs of the Church,


as 
Consecrations, Consultations

for remedy of general disor∣ders,
for 
Audiences Judicial,

when the actions of any Bishop
should be called in question;
or 
Appeals
 from Bishops, 
&c.

It seemed requisite to our An∣cestors
(according to other
Christian Churches (ever since
the first 
Nicene Council
) to
have amongst a certain number
of Bishops, one to be chiefest
in Authority over the rest;
f
om thence named 
Archiepis∣copus,


 Arch or Chief Bishop.


For easing the Bishop of
some part of his burthen, as
the number of Christians wax∣ed
great, or the Diocess was
large, there were ordained in
the Primitive Times 
Chorepis∣copi,
Suffragan,
 or 
Subsidiary

Bishops. Accordingly in the


English Church of a long time
there have been such ordained
by the name of Bishops 
Suf∣fragans

or 
Titular
 Bishops;

who have the Name, Title,
Stile, and Dignity of Bishops,
and (as other Bishops) are con∣secrated
by the Archbishop of
the Province; each one to ex∣ecute
such Power, Jurisdicti∣on,
and Authority, and re∣ceive
such Profits as is limited
in his Commission by the Bi∣shop
or Diocesan, whose Suf∣fragan
he is.


For a Supply of able and fit
Persons to assist Bishops, or to
be made Bishops, it seemed
good to Reverend Antiquity,
that in every Diocess a certain
number of the more prudent
and pious Pastors should be
placed in a 
Collegiate
 manner at


every 
Cathedral
 or 
Episcopal
See;
 where they might not on∣ly
be ready to assist the Bishop
in certain weighty Cases; but
also fit themselves (by gaining
experience and loosing by little
and little their former familia∣rity
with the inferiour Coun∣trey
Clergy) for Government
and Authority in the Church.


Accordingly in every 
Cathe∣dral

Church in 
England,
 there
are a certain number of 
Preben∣daries

or 
Canons,
 and over
them a 
Dean,
 in Latine 
Deca∣nus,


 from 
; because anti∣ently
set over ten Canons at
the least: who is sometime sti∣led

Alter Episcopi Oculus,
 the
other being the 
Archdeacon,

who (though a 
Presbyter
 him∣self)
is so named for his Charge
over the 
Deacons;
 who are to


be guided and directed by him
under the Bishop.


Next is the 
Rural Dean,

who was antiently called 
Ar∣cbipresbyter,

and had the guid∣ance
and direction of the 
Pres∣byters.


In the last place are the Pa∣stors
of every Parish, who are
called 
Rectors,
 unless the 
Pre∣dial

Tythes be 
impropriated,

and then they are called 
Vicars,
quasi vice fungentes Rectorum.


In 
England
 are 2 
Archbi∣shops,
24 Bishops,
 no 
Suffragan
Bishops
 at present; 26 
Deans

of Cathedrals and Collegiate
Churches, 60 
Archdeacons,

544 Prebendaries, many 
Ru∣ral
Deans,
 and about 9700

Rectors
 and 
Vicars,
 besides

Curates,
 who for certain Sti∣pends
assist such Rectors and


Vicars that have the care of
more Churches than one.


These (if it be considered of
what great Learning and Abili∣ties
they are; what great Au∣thority
and Sway they usually
bear over the Laity, to incline,

ead, and draw them; what
great Priviledges and Immuni∣ties
they do or ought to enjoy,
and how much means they pos∣sess)
may well be reputed, as
in all times they have been in all
other States, the first Member
of the Three Estates of 
Eng∣land.


It hath been provided,
 not
without singular wisdom, that as
the ordinary course of common
affairs is disposed of by general
Laws; so likewise mens rarer
incident Necessities and Utilities


should be with special equity
considered. Hence is it that
so many 
Priviledges, Immuni∣ties,
Exemptions,
 and 
Dispen∣sations

have been to the Cler∣gy
of 
England
 granted in all
times: Our Ancestors thinking
it very reasonable that as 
Soul∣diers

were wont by the 
Roman
Emperours
 to be endowed with
certain 
Priviledges
 for their
warding and fighting to pre∣serve
the State from 
external

Enemies, so the Clergy ought
to have certain Immunities and
Priviledges for their 
watching

and 
spiritual
 Warfare to pre∣serve
the State from 
internal

Enemies the 
World,
 the 
Flesh,

and the 
Devil; Ut serventur
immunes Clerici, quo Castris
suis sedulo commorantes, & vigi∣les
excubias ducentes summo caell



mperatori illaesos populos reprae∣
entent,
Legibus effectum est,

t quam plurima iis Privile∣
ia
concessa sint tum ad eorum
personas tum bona ac res spectan∣
ia.


Of 
Priviledges
 some belong
to 
Archbishops,
 some to 
Bishops,

as they are so, and some belong
to them, and to the inferiour
Clergy, as they are 
Ecclesia∣stiques

or 
Churchmen.


Before the coming of the

Savons
 into 
England,
 the 
Chri∣stian
Britains
 had 3 Archbi∣shops,

viz.
 of 
London, York,

and 
Caerleon,
 an antient great
City of 
South-Wales
 upon the
River 
Uske.
 Afterward the

Archiepiscopal See
 of 
London

was by the 
Saxons
 placed at



Canterbury,
 for the sake of St.

Austin
 the Monk, who first
preached the Gospel there to
the 
Heathen Saxons,
 and was
there buried. The other of

Caerleon
 was translated to St.

Davids
 in 
Pembroke-Shire,
 and
afterward subjected wholly to
the See of 
Canterbury;
 since
which all 
England
 and 
Wales

reckon but 2 Archbishops, 
Can∣terbury

and 
York.


The Archbishop of 
Canter∣bury

antiently had 
Primacy
 as
well over all 
Ireland
 as 
Eng∣land,


 and the Irish Bishops re∣ceived
their 
Consecrations
 from
him; for 
Ireland
 had no other
Archbishop until the year
1152, and therefore in the
time of the 2 first 
Norman

Kings, it was declared that



Canterbury
 was the 
Metropolitan

Church of 
England, Scotland,

and 
Ireland,
 and the Isles ad∣jacent.
He was therefore some∣times
stiled a 
Patriarch
 (and 
Pa∣triarcha

was a Chief Bishop o∣ver
several Kingdoms or Pro∣vinces
(as an Archbishop is o∣ver
several Dioceses) and had
several Archbishops under him;
was sometimes called, 
Alterius
Orbis Papa & Orbis Britannici
Pontifex;
 and matters done
and recorded in Ecclesiastical
affairs, ran thus, 
Anno Pon∣tificatus
Nostri primo secundo,
&c.
 He was 
Legatus Natus,

that is, a perpetual 
Legantine

Power was annext to that
Archbishoprick near 1000
years ago; whereby no other

Legat, Nuncio,
 or 
Ambassa∣dour

from the Bishop of 
Rome,



could here exercise any 
Legan∣tine

Power, without special
Licence from the King. He was
so highly respected abroad, that
in General Councils he was pla∣ced
before all other Archbi∣shops
at the Popes right Foot.
He was at home so highly ho∣noured
by the Kings of 
Eng∣land,

that (according to the
Practice of Gods own People
the Jews, where 
Aaron
 was next
in Dignity to 
Moses,
 and ac∣cording
to the practice of most
other 
Christian
 States; where
the next in Dignity and Au∣thority
to the Sovereign, is
usually the chiefest Person of
the Clergy) he was accounted
the 
Second Person
 in the King∣dome,
and named and ranked
even 
before
 the 
Princes of the
Blood.
 He enjoyed some spe∣cial


marks of 
Royalty,
 as to be

Patron
 of a 
Bishoprick
 (as he
was of 
Rochester:
) to 
Coyn
Moneys,
 and to have the Ward∣ships
of all those who held
Lands of him 
Jure Hominii

(as it is called) although they
held in 
Capite
 other Lands of
the King; a 
Princely
 Preroga∣tive,
even against the Kings
written Prerogative.


In an antient 
Charter
 grant∣ed
by 
William
 the 
Conquerour

to 
Lanfranc
 Archbishop of

Canterbury,
 he is to hold his
Lands with the same freedom

in Dominico suo
 (as the words
are) as the King holdeth his

in Dominico suo,
 except only
in 2 or 3 Cases, and those of
no great importance.


It is an Antient Priviledge of
the See of 
Canterbury,
 that


wheresoever any Mannors or
Advowsons do belong unto
that See, that place forthwith
becomes exempt from the Or∣dinary,
and is reputed a Pecu∣liar,
and of the Diocess of 
Can∣terbury.


The Archbishop of 
Canter∣bury

by the favour of our Kings
is judged fit to enjoy still divers
considerable Pre-eminencies.
He is 
Primat
 and 
Metropolitan
over all England,
 and hath a
super-eminency and some Pow∣er
even over the Archbishop of

York;
 hath power to summon
him to a National Synod, and

Archiepis. Eboracensis venire
debet cum Episcopis suis ad nu∣tum
ejus, ut ejus Canonicis dis∣positionibus
obediens existat.


The Archbishop of 
Canterbu∣ry

is at this day 
Primus par Reg∣ni,



the first 
Peer
 of 
England,
 and
next to the Royal Family to pre∣cede
not only all 
Dukes,
 but all
the 
Great Officers
 of the Crown.


He is stiled by the King in
his Writs directed to him, 
Dei
Gratiâ Archiepisc. Cant.
 and
writes himself 
Divina Provi∣dentia,

whereas other Bishops
write 
Divinâ Permissione;
 and
he is said to be 
inthroned,
 when
he is invested in the Archbi∣shoprick.


To Crown the King belongs
to him, and it hath been resol∣ved
that wheresoever the
Court shall happen to be, the
King and Queen are 
Speciales
Domestici Parochiani Domini
Ar. Cant.
 and had antiently the

Holy Offerings
 made at the Al∣tar
by the King and Queen,
wheresoever the Court should


happen to be, if his Grace was
there present. Also the Power
of appointing the 
Lent Preach∣ers,

as thought by our Ance∣stors
much more fit for a Pre∣late
or Spiritual Person to do,
(as in all other Christian
Courts) then for any Lay
Lord, as hath been used in

England
 since one 
Cromwell
 was
by 
Hen.
 8. made Vicar Gene∣ral,
and placed above the
Archbishop of 
Canterbury.


The Bishop of 
London
 is ac∣counted
his Provincial 
Dean,

the Bishop of 
Winchester
 his

Chancellour,
 and the Bishop of

Rochester
 his 
Chaplain.


In writing and speaking to
him is given the Title of 
Grace,

(as it is to all Dukes) and 
Most
Reverend Father in God.



He hath the Power of all

Probate
 of 
Testaments,
 and
granting Letters of Admini∣stration,
where the Party dy∣ing
had 
Bona Notabilia,
 that is
five pounds worth or above,
out of the Diocess wherein he
died; or ten pounds worth
within the Diocess of 
London;

or if the party dying be a Bi∣shop,
though he hath no Goods
out of the Diocess where he
died. Also to make Wills for
all such as die intestate within
his Province, and to admini∣ster
their Goods to the Kindred
or to Pious Uses, according to
his discretion; which most
transcendent Trust and Power
is so antiently in 
England
 be∣longing
to Bishops, that the
best Antiquary cannot find the
first Original thereof.



By Stat. 25 
H.
 8. he hath
the 
Honour
 and 
Power
 to grant

Licences
 and 
Dispensations
 in
all Cases heretofore sued for in
the Court of 
Rome,
 not repug∣nant
to the Law of God or the
Kings Prerogative. As to al∣low
a Clerk to hold a Benefice
in 
Commendam
 or 
Trust;
 To
allow a Son (contrary to the
Canons) to succeed his Father
immediately in a Benefice; To
allow a Clerk rightly qualified
to hold two Benefices with
Cure of Souls; To abolish ir∣regularity
gotten without a
mans own default, as by defect
of body or birth, or by acci∣dental
killing of a man, 
&c.
 To
abolish the guilt of Simony;
To allow a Beneficed Clerk for
some certain Causes to be 
Non-Resident

for some time; To al∣low


a Lay-man to hold a Pre∣bend,

&c.
 whilst by study he
is preparing himself for the
Service of the Church; To
grant Dispensations to sick, to
Old People, to Women with
Child, to eat flesh on dayes
whereon it was forbidden; To
constitute Publick Notaries,
whose single Testimony is as
good as the Testimonies of any
two other Persons. He hath
the Power to grant 
Literns
Tuitorias,
 whereby any one
that brings his Appeal, may
prosecute the same without any
molestation; To bestow one
Dignity or Prebend in any Ca∣thedral
Church within his Pro∣vince
upon every Creation
there of a new Bishop; who
is also to provide a sufficient
Benefice for one of the Chap∣lains


of the Archbishop, or
to maintain him till it be ef∣fected.


By the Stat. 
Primo Eliz.
 it is
provided that the Queen by
the Advice of the Archbishop
might ordain and publish such
Rites and Ceremonies as may
be for Gods glory, for edifying
the Church, and due reverence
of the Sacraments.


He hath the Prerogative to

Consecrate
 a Bishop (though it
must be done in the presence
and with the assistance of two
other Bishops (as every Bishop
gives Ordination but with the
assistance of Presbyters) to as∣sign

Co-adjutors
 to infirm Bi∣shops;
to confirm the Electi∣ons
of Bishops within his Pro∣vince;
to call Provincial Synods
according to the Kings Writ al∣wayes


directed to him; to be
Moderator in the Synods or
Convocations; to give his
Suffrage there last of all; to
visit the whole Province; to
appoint a 
Guardian
 of the 
Spi∣ritualties,

during the Vacancy
of any Bishoprick within his
Province; whereby all the E∣piscopal
Rights of that Diocess
belong to him, all Ecclesiasti∣cal
Jurisdiction, as Visitation,
Institutions, 
&c.


The Archbishop may retain
and qualifie 8 Chaplains, which
is 2 more than any Duke by
Statute is allowed to do.


The Archbishop of 
Canter∣bury

hath moreover the Power
to hold divers 
Courts
 of 
Judi∣cature

for deciding of Differen∣ces
in Ecclesiastical Affairs, as
his 
Court of Arches,
 his 
Court


of Audience,
 his 
Prerogative
Court,
 and his Court of 
Pecu∣liars;

of all which shall be
handled particularly, and a∣part
in the Second Part of the
Present State of 
England.


These and other Preroga∣tives
and Priviledges, the Wis∣dom
of our first Reformers
thought fit to be retained and
added to the Chief Person
(under the King) of the Church
of 
England.


The next Person in the
Church of 
England
 is the
Archbishop of 
York;
 who was
antiently also of very high re∣pute
in this Nation, and had
under his Province not only
divers Bishopricks in the North
of 
England,
 but all the Bi∣shopricks
of 
Scotland
 for a long


time; until the year 1470,
when Pope 
Sixtus
 the 4th cre∣ated
the Bishop of St. 
Andrews

Archbishop and Metropolitan
of all 
Scotland.


He was also 
Legatus Natus

and had the Legantine Office
and Authority annext to that
Archbishoprick.


He hath still the place and
precedence of all Dukes not of
the Royal Blood, and of all
Great Officers of State, ex∣cept
only the Lord Chancel∣lour;
hath the Title of 
Grace

and 
Most Reverend Father;

hath the Honour to 
Crown the
Queen,
 and to be her perpetual

Chaplain.


He is stiled 
Metropolitan of
England,
 and hath under his
Province the Bishopricks of

York, Durham, Carlile, Chester,



and that of the 
Isle
 of 
Man.


Hath the Rights of a 
Count
Palatine
 over a certain Territory
near 
York
 erected by King 
Rich.

2. into a 
County Palatine.
 May
qualifie also 8 Chaplains, and
hath within his Province divers
other Prerogatives and Privi∣ledges
which the Archbishop
of 
Canterbury
 hath within his
own Province.


The next in place amongst
the Clergy of 
England
 are the
Bishops, so called from the
Saxon word 
Biscop,
 and that
from the Greek 
, 
Spe∣culator,
Explorator vel Superin∣tendens,

an Officer amongst
the Heathen so called, 
quia
praeerat pani & victui quotidia∣no:
Episcopus enim apud Chri∣stionos
praeest pani & victui
spirituali.



All the Bishops of 
England

are Barons and Peers of the
Realm. They are Barons by a
threefold manner (which can∣not
be said of the Lay Lords)
they are 
Feodal
 in regard of
their Lands and Baronies an∣next
to their Bishopricks.
They are 
Barons by Writ,
 be∣ing
summoned by the Kings
Writ to Parliament, and they
are 
created Barons by Patent,

which at their 
Consecration
 is al∣wayes
exhibited to the Arch∣bishop.
They have the Pre∣cedence
of all Temporal Ba∣rons
under Vicounts. In the
Parliament have place in the

Upper House
 in a 
double
 capaci∣ty,
not only as Barons, but as
Bishops; for before they were
Barons, they had in all times
place in the Great Council of


the Kingdome: and there ever
placed on the Kings 
right hand,

not only to give their Advice
as the Judges do, but 
ad tra∣ctandum,
ordinandum, statuen∣dum,
definiendum,
 &c. They
have the Title of 
Lords
 and

Right Reverend Fathers.


All Bishops in 
England
 have
one or two transcendent Privi∣ledges,
which seem almost 
Re∣gal;

as, In their own Courts to
judge and pass Sentence alone
by themselves, without any

Collegue
 or 
Assessor;
 which is
not done in other of the Kings
Courts: for the Bishops Courts
(though held by the Kings
Authority 
Virtute Magistratus
sui
) are not accounted to be

properly
 the Kings Courts, and
therefore the Bishops send forth
Writs in their own Names,



Teste
 the Bishop, and not in
the Kings Name; as all the
Kings Courts properly so called
do.


Moreover Bishops have this
other transcendent Priviledge,
To depute their Authority to
another (as the King doth) ei∣ther
to their 
Bishops Suffragans,

to their 
Chancellours,
 to their

Commissaries
 or other Officers;
which none of the Kings
Judges may do.


All Bishops have one Privi∣ledge
above and beyond all
Lay Lords, 
viz.
 That in
whatsoever Christian Princes
Dominions they come, their
Episcopal Dignity and Degree
is acknowledged; and they
may, 
quatenus Bishops,
 confer

Orders, &c.
 whereas no Lay

Baron, Vicount, Marquiss,
 nor



Duke,
 is in Law acknowledge∣ed
such out of the Dominions
of the Prince who conferred
those Honours.


The Laws and Customs of

England
 are so tender of the
Honour, Credit, Reputation,
and Person of Bishops our Spi∣ritual
Fathers, that none might
(without special Licence from
the King first obtained) be
endited of any Crime before
any Temporal Judge.


Upon severe Penalty by our
Laws no man may raise re∣ports,
whereby 
Scandal
 may
arise to the Person of any
Bishop, or Debate and Discord
between them and the Com∣mons
of 
England.


In Civil Trials, where a Bi∣shop
is Plaintiff or Defendant,
the Bishop may as well as any


Lay Lord, challenge the 
Array,


 one 
Knight
 at least be not

eturned of the Jury, and it

hall be allowed unto him as

 Priviledge due to his Peerage.


In Criminal Trials for life, all

ishops by 
Magna Charta
 and

tat. 25 
Edw.
 3. are to be try∣
d
by their Peers, who are Ba∣
ns,
and none under; not∣
ithstanding
the late conceit of

ome Lawyers, that because
Bishops may not be on the Cri∣minal
Trial of a Peer, there∣
ore
are not to be tried by

eers; for so neither may Bi∣shops
be tried by a Common

ury, Because they may not

e on the Trial of such men.
Moreover, Noble-women may

ot be on the Trial of Peers,

nd yet they are to be tried by
Peers of the Realm. And


there is no 
Legal
 Precedent 


England
 of a Bishop remaining
a Bishop, that ever was tried for
his life, but by Peers of th

Realm. Antiently indeed Bi∣shops
were so ecempted, as no

at all to be tried by 
Tempor

Judges, till after 
deprivatio

and 
degradation,
 and then be∣ing
thereby rendred no Peers
but common Persons, the

might be tried by Common
Juries.


Since the Reformation, th

English Protestant Bishop

have been so constantly loya

and true to the Crown (

which they are so much m
∣ligned
by Non-Conformists
and so free from all Capita

Crimes, that there is yet 

Precedent in 
England
 for thei

manner of Trial for Life. A




 that Common Assertion,

hat no Lords of Parliament

 to be tried by their Peers,

 such as sit there 
Ratione

obilitatis,
 and that all Lay

ords have place in Parliament

 
that reason;
 it is not on∣

false but frivolous in the

dgement of very many judi∣
ous
men. And indeed how

urd
 and 
unreasonable
 must it

eds be (let all men judge)

at an Archbishop of 
Canter∣
ry,

who is by all acknow∣
dged
to be 
Primus Par Reg∣
,

should be tried by a Com∣
on
Jury of Freeholders,

en as the meanest Lay Ba∣
,
though created but ye∣
rday,
may not be tried by a∣

under Barons?


In Parliament Bishops as Ba∣
as
may be present and vote at


the Trial and Arraignment 

a Peer of the Realm, only b
∣fore
Sentence of Death or lo

of Member be pronounced
that they may have no hand 

blood, no hand in 
destroying

but only in 
saving;
 they hav

by Canon Law the 
Priviled

and 
Injunction
 to absent them∣selves,
and by Common La

to make Proxies to vote for
them.


Primo Eliz. cap.
 2. It is ex∣presly
declared that all Lords 

Parliament (without any ex∣ception
of Lords Spiritual 

should be tried in that particu∣lar
by their Peers.


The Bishops of 
England
 en∣joy
at this day many other Pri∣viledges
as freedom from Ar∣rests,
Outlawries, Distress 
p

Equitaturam
 or 
in a Journey



Liberty to hunt in any of the
Kings Forrests or Parks, to
kill one or two Deer going from
or coming to the King upon his
Order.


The Persons of Bishops may
not be seised upon Contempt
(as the Persons of Lay Lords)
but their Temporalities only
may be seised.


Every Bishop may by Sta∣tute
Law qualifie as many
Chaplains as a Duke, 
viz.

six.


The Laws of 
England
 attri∣buteth
so very much to the
Word of a Bishop, that not
only in the Trial of 
Bastardy

the Bishops Certificate shall
suffice, but also in Trial of

Heresie,
 which toucheth a mans

Life,
 upon the Bishops bare
Certificate that any hath been


convicted before him of Here∣sie,
the Secular Power puts him
to death without any trial by
his Peers.


The Persons the Spiritual
Governours of the Church of

England,
 are of such high and
tender respect in the eye of
the Law, that it is thought fit
to exact the same respect from
a Clergyman to his Bishop or
Ordinary, as from a Child to
his Father; and therefore made
the Offences of 
Parricide
 and

Episcopicide
 equal, 
viz.
 both
Petty Treason.


Next to the two Archbi∣shops
of 
England,
 the Bishop of

London
 amongst all the Bishops
hath the pre-eminence. 
Epis∣copus
Londinensis
 (saith an an∣cient
Record) 
speciali quadam


Dignitate caeteris anteponendus
quia Ecclesiae Cantuariensis De∣canus
est Provincialis.
 Being
Bishop over the 
Imperial
 and

Capital
 City of 
England,
 it is
by a Statute of later times ex∣presly
provided that he should
have the preference and prece∣dence
of all the Bishops of

England;
 whereby he is be∣come
(as heretofore the 
Lord
Prior
 of the 
Order
 of St. 
John

of 
Jerusalem) Primus Baro
Regni,
 as the Lord 
Abergaven∣ny

is 
Primus Baronum Laico∣rum.


Next amongst those of the

Episcopal Colledge
 is the Bishop
of 
Durham,
 within the Pro∣vince
of 
York,
 who hath been
a 
Count Palatine
 6 or 700 years;
wherefore the Common Seal


of the Bishoprick hath been
of a long time an 
Armed
Knight,
 holding in one hand a

naked Sword,
 and in the other
a 
Church.


In the fifth place by vertue
of the fore-mentioned Statute,
is the Bishop of 
Winchester,
 re∣puted
antiently 
Earl of South∣ampton,

and so stiled in the
Statutes of the 
Honourable Or∣der

of the 
Garter
 by 
Hen.
 8.
though soon after that Earl∣dome
was otherwise disposed
of.


After these afore-named all
the other Bishops take place
according to the 
Seniority
 of
their 
Consecration,
 unless any
Bishop happen to be made
Lord 
Chancellour, Treasurer,


Privy Seal,
 or 
Secretary
 of

State;
 which antiently was
very usual, as reputed for their

Piety, Learning, Single Life,
Diligence, &c.
 far more fit for
the Advantage and Service of
the King and Kingdome, than
any Laymen; and in such case
a Bishop being Lord 
Chancel∣lour,

had place next to the
Archbishop of 
Canterbury
 and
above the Archbishop of 
York;

and being 
Secretary of State,

had place next to the Bishop of

Winchester.

These are all Barons and
Peers of the Realm, these have
place in the Upper House of
Parliament, and in the Upper
House of Convocation, and
these are the 
Lords Spiritual;

next follow the 
Commons Spi∣ritual,

consisting of 
Suffragan
Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons,
Prebends, Rectors,
 and 
Vicars,

to whom also belong divers
considerable Priviledges.


All 
Suffragan Bishops,
 all

Deans, Archdeacons, Preben∣daries,
Rectors,
 and 
Vicars,

have Priviledges, some by them∣selves,
others by proxy or by


representative, to sit and vote
in the Lower House of Convo∣cation.


No Subsidies or other Taxe
to the King may legally be laid
upon them, without their own
consent first had in Convoca∣tion.


The Clergy (as appears by
the words of the 
Writ,
 as also
by 
Modus Tenendi Parliam▪
 and
by 21 
Rich. 2. cap.
 12.) hath

per Procuratores Cleri,
 Place
and Suffrage in the 
Lower House

of Parliament, as was antient∣ly
practised in 
England,
 and of
later years in 
Ireland
 (though
now not used in either) and as
the Bishops still have and use in
the Higher House of Parlia∣ment.


No Clergyman may be com∣pelled
to undergo any 
Personal


Functions
 or 
Services
 of the

Commonwealth,
 or to serve in

War.
 If any man by reason
of his Land, be subject to be e∣lected
to any 
Temporal
 Office,
if he take Orders he is free,
and there is a Writ purposely to
free him.


All Clergymen are free
from the Kings 
Purveyors,
 the
Kings 
Carriages,
 the Kings

Posts, &c.
 for which they may
demand a 
Protection
 from the
King 
cum clausula nolumus.


If a Clergyman acknow∣ledge
a 
Statute,
 his 
Body
 shall
not be taken by vertue of any

Process
 thereupon; for the
Writ runs, 
Si Laicus sit, &c.


Clergymen are not obliged
to appear at 
Sherives Tourns,

or 
Views of Frank Pledge,
 there
to take their 
Oath
 of 
Allege∣ance,



the Antient Laws presu∣ming
that those whose princi∣pal
care and Office should be
to teach the People 
Loyalty
 and

Allegeance
 to their King, could
not themselves 
want
 Loyalty.


By 
Magna Charta
 no Clergy∣man
is to be 
fined
 or 
amerced
 ac∣cording
to his 
spiritual
 means,
but according to his 
temporal

estate, and according to the

Crime
 committed.


The 
Goods
 of Clergymen are
discharged by the Common
Law of 
England
 from 
Tolls

and 
Customes (si non exerceant
Marchandizas de eisdem
) of

Avirage, Pontage, Muriage,
Paviage;
 for which they have
the Kings 
Writ
 to discharge
them.


The 
Glebe
 Lands and 
Spiri∣tual

Revenues of Clergymen


being held 
in pura & perpetua
Eleemosyna
 (i. e.) in 
Frankal∣moine,

are exempted from ar∣raying
and mustering of Men
or Horses for the War, as ap∣pears
in a Statute still in force,

viz. 8 Hen. 4. Num.
 12. in
the unprinted Rolls of that
Parliament.


The Clergy being by their

Function
 prohibited to wear a

Sword
 or any Armes (their

Coat
 alone being their defence)
cannot serve in 
Person
 in 
War.

They serve their 
Countrey
 o∣therwise,
and for that Service
have alwayes been thought
worthy of their 
Spiritual Pro∣fits

and 
Revenues,
 and of the
Kings 
Protection.


The Clergy paying to the
King the 
First years profits
 of
all Spiritual Benefices, called



First Fruits,
 and 
yearly
 the

Tenth
 of all the said Benefices,
are with great reason thought
fit to be 
exempted
 from all o∣ther

Taxes;
 though to give
the Laity 
good example,
 they
often lay Subsidies or other
Great Taxes upon them∣selves.


It was an Antient Maxime
in
 England, Nullus pro deci∣mis
debet onerari de aliqua repa∣ratione
Pontis seu aliquibus one∣ribus
temporalibus.


These and other Immuni∣ties
of the Clergy the Great

Aquinas
 thought agreeable to
Natural Equity or the Law
of Nature, thence it was that
King 
Pharaoh 47 Gen.
 when
all the Lands of his Subjects
were mortgaged to him for
Bread, yet spared the Lands


of the Priests. So 
Ezra
 7. 24.
and so in our Antient Laws we
find, 
De Danigeldo libera &
quieta erat omnis Ecclesia in An∣glia
& etiam omnis Terra quae in
proprio Dominio Ecclesiae erat u∣bicunque
jacebat nihil prorsus in
tali redditione persolvens;
 and
the reason thereof is added,

Quia magis in Ecclesiae confide∣bant
Orationibus quam in Armo∣rum
defensionibus.


Many more Priviledges, Im∣munities,
Liberties, and Fran∣chises
there are rightly belong∣ing
to the Clergy of 
England,

so many, that to set down all,
saith Sir 
Edward Coke
 upon

Magna Charta,
 would take up
a whole Book.


The Priviledges of the Cler∣gy
and Franchises of the
Church, were (with the Li∣ties


of the People) granted,
confirmed, and sealed by the
King in full Parliament,
 Anno
1253. 
in such a solemn manner,
as no Story can parallel it: The
King stood up with his Hand
upon his Breast, all the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal stood
with burning Tapers in their
hands; the Archbishop pro∣nounced
as followeth,
 By the
Authority of God Omnipotent,
of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost, &c. We excommunicate,
anathematize, and sequester from
Our Holy Mother the Church, all
those which henceforth knowing∣ly
and maliciously deprive and
spoil Churches of their right,
and all those that shall by any
art or wit rashly violate, dimi∣nish,
or alter secretly or openly,
in Deed, Word, or Counsel, those


Ecclesiastical Liberties, &c.
granted by Our Lord the King
to the Archbishops, Bishops, Pre∣lates,
&c. For everlasting
memory whereof We have here∣unto
put Our Seals. 
After
which all throwing down their
Tapers extinguisht and smoak∣ing,
they all said,
 So let all
that shall go against this Curse
be extinct and stink in Hell.


Since which all Kings of 
Eng∣land

at their Coronations have
by Solemn Oaths promised to
preserve the same, and they
have been confiremed by above
30 Successive Parliaments,
commanded to be read once a
year in Churches; and if any
Act should be made to the con∣trary,
it is to be held for null
and void, by the Statute of
42 
Edw.
 3.



Antiently men were very
tender and fearful to do any
thing that might make them
incur the said dreadful censure;
but of later times, especially
since our Reformation, many
men pretending to more Chri∣stianity,
and to more know∣ledge,
have made little consci∣ence
of infringing and violating
any Rights, Priviledges, or
Franchises of the Church or
Churchmen; whilst the Li∣berties
of the People (though
very little violated) have been
exacted, even to Sedition and
Rebellion.


To the end that men of the
best rank and abilities should
in all times be encouraged to
embrace the most painful and
severe Profession of a Clergy∣man,



and that the People

hould the more willingly be

uided and conducted by them.
Our most Christian Ancestors,

ccording to the Pattern of
Gods antient People the Jews,

nd of all other Christian Com∣monwealths,
judged it expe∣
ient
to allot large Revenues,

nd a most plentiful mainte∣
ance
to the English Clergy;

aving observed with 
Solomon


hat a Wiseman for his pover∣
y
is too oft contemned and

espised, and that there is no∣
hing
more contemptible and

diculous than a poor Clergy∣man.


The first Kings of 
England


ad all the Lands of 
England


 Demesne. The second sole
Monarch amongst the Saxon
Kings 
Ethelwolphus,
 by the ad∣vice


of his Nobles, gave fo

ever to God and the Church
both the Tythe of all Good
and the Tenth part of all the
Lands of 
England,
 free from
all Secular Service, Taxations
or Impositions whatsoever; the
Charter of which Donation 

to be seen in 
Ingulphus
 and o∣ther
Authors; which Chart

thus ends, 
Qui augere voluer

nostram donationem
 (as many
Pious Kings and Nobles sin

have done) 
augeat Omnipoten

Deus dies ejus prosperos, si qu

vero mutare vel minuere praesump

serit noscat se ad tribunal Christ
rationem redditurum.


Beside the Tenth of Land▪
and the Husbandmans profits
Merchants also and Shop-keepers
paid to their Spiritua

Pastors the Tenth of thei



Gain, Servants in divers Pla∣
es
the Tenth of their Wages,

 as Soldiers in the Kings Ar∣mies
do now a part of their
Pay) and in some places 
Ale∣
ellers

the Tenth Flagon. Al∣
o
Handicrafts-men and Day-
abourers
paid the Tenth of

heir Wages upon their Oaths,

 required.


Per Assisas Forestae
 and other

ecords, it doth appear that

ythes have been paid even

f Venison in divers parts of

England,
 men making consci∣
nce
in those dayes, as amongst

he antient Jews, to pay Tythes

f all they poss
ssed.


Besides all those, in some pla∣
es
were paid to the Pastor, Ob∣
entions,
Oblations, Pensions,
Mortuaries, 
&c.
 so that the En∣
lish
Clergy were the best provi∣ded


for of any Clergy in the
whole World, except only the
Nation of the Jews, amongst
whom the Tribe of 
Levi
 be∣ing
not the 40th part of the
12 Tribes, as appears in the
Book of 
Numbers;
 yet had as
Mr. 
Selden
 confesseth, and
that by Gods own appointment
three times the Annual Reve∣nue
of the greatest of the 12
Tribes: insomuch that the
poorest Priest in the 24 Cour∣ses
might be reputed a wealthy
person.


And as amongst the Jews the
24 Chief Priests, for the bet∣ter
maintenance of their Au∣thority
and Dignity, had
means far exceeding those of
the Inferiour Clergy, and the
High Priest had a Maintenance
as far exceeding any of the said


24 Priests. So in 
England
 the
Bishops by the great Piety and
Bounty of several English
Kings, had in Lands and Re∣venues
Temporal and Spiritu∣al,
a Maintenance far more

mple than those of the In∣feriour
Clergy, and the 2
Archbishops more ample than

he Bishops.


William
 the Conquerour at
his coming into 
England,
 found

he Bishopricks then in being

 richly endowed with Lands,

hat he erected them all into
Baronies, and every Barony

hen consisted of 13 Knights
Fees at the least.


Besides the
e belonged to
Bishops several Perquisits and
Duties for the Visitations of

heir Diocesses, for Ordina∣sions,
Institutions, 
Census


Cathedraticus subsidium Chari∣tativum,

which upon reasona∣ble
Causes they might require

of the Clergy under them;
also other Duties, called, 
De∣cimarum
quarta, Mortuariorum
& Oblationum pensitatio Ju

Hospitii, Processio, Litania,
Viatici vel Commeatus collatio▪

which upon a Journey to 
Rom

they might demand. Tenth

and First Fruits was antiently
paid (as is believed) to the se∣veral
Diocesans, and was con∣tinued
to the Bishop of 
Nor∣wich

till 
Henry
 8. deprived him
thereof, and deprived the Pope
of all the rest. Moreover all
Cathedral Churches were by
divers Kings and Nobles rich∣ly
furnisht with Lands for th

plentiful maintenance of a
Dean and a certain number of


Prebends; insomuch that to∣gether
with the Lands given to
Monasteries, a third part of the
Lands of 
England
 belonged to
the Church and Church-men;
whereby did accrue much be∣nefit
to this Nation, great
Hospitality was kept, many
Hospitals, Colledges, Churches,
Bridges built, and other Pub∣lick,
Pious, and Charitable
Works. All Leases held of
them by the Laity, were not

aly much more easie than o∣ther
Tenures, but so unque∣stionable,
that there was little
work for the Lawyers; so
much peaceableness, that 140
sworn Attourneys was thought
sufficient to serve the whole
Kingdome.


At present the Revenues of
the English Clergy is general∣ly


very small and insufficient
above a third part of the best
Benefices of 
England
 being an∣tiently
by the Popes Grant ap∣propriated
to Monasteries, to∣wards
their maintenance, were
upon the dissolution of Mona∣steries
made Lay Fees; be∣sides
what hath been taken by
secret and indirect means, tho∣row
corrupt Compositions an

Compacts and Customs in ma∣ny
other Parishes; also man

large Estates wholly exemp

from paying Tythes, as Land
belonging to the Cistertia

Monks, to the Knights Tem∣plars
and Hospitallers. Tho

Benefices that are free from
these things, yet (besides Fi

Fruits and Tenths to the King
and Procurations to the Bishop
are taxed towards the Charg



of their respective Parishes, and
towards the publique charges of
the Nation above and beyond
the proportion of the Laity.


The Bishopricks of 
England

have been also since the later
end of 
Hen.
 8. to the coming
in of King 
James,
 most mise∣rably
robbed and spoiled of the
greatest part of their Lands and
Revenues; so that at this day
a mean Gentleman of 200 
l.

land yearly, will not change his
worldly estate and condition
with divers Bishops: an At∣tourney,
a Shop-Keeper, a
common Artisan; will hardly
change theirs with ordinary Pa∣stors
of the Church.


Some few Bishopricks do yet
retain a competency, amongst
which the Bishoprick of 
Dur∣ham

is accounted one of the


Chief, the yearly Revenues
whereof before the late trou∣bles
was above 6000 
l.
 of
which by the late Act for abo∣lishing
Tenures in 
Capite,
 was
lost above 2000 
l.
 yearly. Out
of it an yearly Pension of 880

l
 is paid to the 
Crown
 ever
since the Raign of Queen 
Eli∣zabeth,

who promised in lieu
thereof so much in 
Impropri∣ations;

which was never per∣formed.
Above 340 
l.
 yearly
paid to several Officers of the
County Palatine of 
Durham,

The Assises and Sessions duly
kept in the Bishops House, at
the sole Charges of the Bi∣shop.
The several expences
for keeping in repair certain
Banks of Rivers in that Bi∣shoprick,
and of several Hou∣ses
belonging to the Bishoprick.


Moreover the yearly Tenths,
the Publick Taxes, the Char∣ges
of going to, and waiting
at Parliament, being deducted,
there will remain 
communibus
annis
 to the Bishop to keep
Hospitality▪ (which must be
great) and to provide for those
of his Family but about 1500 
l.

yearly. The like might be
said of some other Principal
Bishopricks.


The great diminution of the
Revenues of the Clergy and
the little care of augmenting
or defending the Patrimony of
the Church, is the great re∣proach
and shame of the En∣glish
Reformation, and will
one day prove the ruin of
Church and State.


Judicious Mr. 
Hooker
 (who
in the Preface of his Works


fore-told our late troubles 40
years before they came to pass)
observing in his time how the
Church was every day robbed
of her Dues, and that it was
then an opinion rife 
[That to
give to the Church smelt of Ju∣daisme
and Popery, and to take
from the Church what our Ance∣stors
had given, was Reformati∣on.]

declared that what 
Moses

saith in the 90th Psalme, was
likely to be verified of 
Religi∣on

and 
Gods Service
 amongst
us. The time thereof may be

Threescore years and ten,
 if it
continue till 
Fourscore
 it will be
but small joy to those that shall
then behold the Condition of
the 
English Church;
 and the
best read Historian cannot pro∣duce
one example of a happy

State,
 where the 
Clergy
 hath


been exposed to the peoples

Contempt;
 which must needs
happen where their 
Benefices

their 
Maintenance
 is 
scandalous

and their 
Persons despicable.


It is the last Trick saith St.

Gregory,
 that the Devil hath in
this World, when he cannot
bring the 
Word
 and 
Sacraments

in disgrace by 
Errours
 and 
He∣resies,

he invented this Project,
to bring the 
Clergy
 into con∣tempt
and low esteem, as it is
now in 
England;
 where they
are accounted by many as the

dross
 and 
refuse
 of the 
Nation:

Men think it a stain to their
blood, to place their Sons in
that Function, and Women a∣shamed
to marry with any of
them; whereas antiently in

England
 (as among the Jews,
the Tribe of 
Levi
 was counted


Noble, above all other Tribes
except that of the Royal Tribe
of 
Judah
) the Function of the
Clergy was of so high account
and esteem, that not only the
best Gentry and Nobility, but
divers of the 
Sons
 and 
Brothers

of divers of our English Kings
since the Conquest and before,
disdained not to enter into 
Ho∣ly
Orders,
 and to be Clergy∣men,
as at this day is practised
in most other Monarchies of
Christendome. 
Ethelwolph
 Son
and Successor to 
Egbert,
 first sole
King of 
England,
 was in Holy
Orders and Bishop of 
Winche∣ster

at his Fathers death. 
Odo

Bishop of 
Bayeux
 in 
Normandy,

was Brother to 
William
 the

Conquerour. Henry de Blois

Brother to King 
Stephen
 was
Bishop of 
Winchester. Geofry


Plantagenet
 Son to 
Henry
 2
was Bishop of 
Lincoln. Henry
de Beaufort
 Brother to 
Henry

the 4th, was Bishop also of

Winchester.
 And of later Times
that most prudent 
Henry
 7 had
designed his second Son to be
a Clergyman, to omit many
others of Noble Blood.
Which Policy is still observed
even amongst the few Families
of the Romish Religion in 
Eng∣land,

wherein are to be found
at this day some Brothers or
Sons of 
Dukes, Marquisses,
Earls,
 and 
Barons
 in Holy Or∣ders,
and all the rest of the
Stock of 
Baronets, Knights,

or 
Gentry;
 and for this cause
find respect not only amongst
those of their own Opinions;
but even of the more sober,
moderate, and best civilized


Protestants. Whilst this Policy
lasted in 
England,
 the Clergy
were judged the fittest Persons
to execute most of the Chief
Offices and Places of the King∣dom
(according to the Divine
Policy amongst Gods peculiar
People, where the Priests and
Levites were the Principal Of∣ficers
and Judges in every
Court; to whom the People
were to be obedient on pain of
death) and the Laity did with
much reverence and respect
submit to them. And as then

Os Sacerdotis, Oraculum erat
plebis
 (according to that of

Malachi
 2. 7.) So 
Os Episcopi
Oraculum erat Regis & Regni &
Rex amplectabatur universum
Clerum lata fronte & ex eo
semper sibi eligebat primos a
Consiliis, primos ad officia Regni


obeunda. Primi igitur sedebant
in omni Regni Comitiis & Tri∣bunalibus
Episcopi, in Regali
quidem Palatio cum Regni Mag∣natibus,
in Comitatu una cum
Comite, in Turno cum Vice∣comite,
& in Hundredo cum
Domino Hundredi, sic ut in pro∣movenda
Justitia usquequaque
gladius gladium adjuvaret & ni∣hil
inconsulto Sacerdote vel E∣piscopo
ageretur.
 And because
the Weal of the Kingdom and
the Service of the King de∣pended
so much upon them,
and their presence for that end
so oft required at 
London,
 it
was judged expedient that
every Bishoprick should have a
Palace or House belonging to
it in or about 
London;
 and it is
known at this day where stood
the Houses of every one, ex∣cept


that of St. 
Asaph,
 which
also might probably have had
one, but more obscure than
some other; that Bishoprick
having been, as still, very
mean.


Great was the 
Authority
 of
the 
Clergy
 in those dayes, and
their 
Memory
 should be 
precious

in these dayes, if we consider
that they were the Authors of
so great benefits and advanta∣ges
to this Kingdom, that
there are few things of any
importance for promoting of
the welfare of this Church and
State, wherein the Bishops and
Prelats; under God, have not
been the 
Principal Instruments.

The Excellent Laws made by
King 
Ina,
 King 
Athelstan,

King 
Edmund,
 and St. 
Edward

from whom we have our Com∣mon


Laws, and our Priviledges
mentioned in 
Magna Charta,

were all made by the perswasi∣ons
and advice of 
Bishops
 and

Archbishops
 named in our Hi∣stories.
The 
Union
 of the 2
Houses of 
York
 and 
Lancaster;

(whereby a long and bloody
War was ended) was by the
most wise Advice and Counsel
of 
Bishop Morton,
 then a Privy
Councellour. The 
Union
 of

England
 and 
Scotland,
 that in∣expressible
advantage to both
Nations, was brought to pass
by the long fore-sight of Re∣verend.
Bishop 
Fox
 a Privy
Councellour, in advising 
Hen∣ry

the 7th, to match his Eldest
Daughter to 
Scotland,
 and his
Younger to 
France.
 Most of
the Great Publick Works now
remaining in 
England,
 acknow∣ledge


their antient and present
being either to the 
sole Cost
and Charges,
 or to the 
liberal
Contributions,
 or at least to the

powerful Perswasions
 of Bishops;
as most of the best endowed

Colledges
 in both our 
Vniver∣sities,

very many 
Hospitals,
Churches, Palaces, Castles,

have been founded and built
by Bishops; even that famous
chargeable and difficult Stru∣cture
of 
London-Bridge
 stands
obliged to the liberal Contri∣butions
of an Archbishop; and
it was a 
Bishop
 of 
London,
 at
whose earnest request 
William

the 
Conquerour
 granted to the
City of 
London
 so large Privi∣ledges,
that in a grateful re∣membrance
thereof, the 
Lord
Mayor
 and 
Aldermen
 to this
day, upon some solemn dayes


of their resort to St. 
Pauls

Church, do go in 
Procession
 to
the 
Grave Stone
 where that Bi∣shop
lies interred.


But above all, The Con∣verting

England
 to the Christi∣an
Religion, the Reforming
that Religion when corrupted,
and since that, the maintenance
of the Doctrine thereof against
all Romish Writers, and of the
Discipline thereof (none of the
least good Offices) against all
the Practices and Power of the
Puritan and Presbyterian Fa∣ctions,
and all those other Se∣ctaries
lineally descended from
them; all this and more is ow∣ing
(if not solely, yet principal∣ly)
to Bishops and Prelats: by
the late want of whom to sit
at the Stern, how soon was
this goodly Vessel split upon


the Rocks of Anarchy and
Confusion.


Even since the late Restau∣ration
of Bishops, to set down
the many considerable Publick
Benefits flowing from them
and other Dignified Clergy,
would tire the Reader.


What Sums of Money have
been by them expended in
repairing Cathedral Churches,
Episcopal Houses, in founding
and building Hospitals, in Cha∣rity
to poor Widdows of Cler∣gymen
utterly ruined by the
late Rebels, for redeeming of
poor Christian Slaves at 
Algier,

what publick and private Sums
for supplying the Kings Neces∣sities
at his Restauration, what
Expences in Hospitality, 
&c.

above and beyond the Charity
and Bounty of others, who


have ten times their Wealth
and Riches.


As they have then been be∣neficial
to this Kingdome a∣bove
and beyond other ranks
of men, so they have had the
highest respect, reverence, and
esteem.


In all Ages amongst all
Nations, amongst 
Turks,
 as
well as 
Jews
 and 
Christians,
 it
was judged fit that the Princi∣pal

Domestique Servants
 of the
King of Heaven and Earth ei∣ther
should be of the 
Chiefest

and 
Noblest
 upon Earth, or at
least should be so esteemed.


Such 
Reverence
 our Ance∣stors
bare to that Function,
that (as 
Selden
 observes) to
fall down and 
kiss the Feet,
 was
a Ceremony usual towards o∣ther
Bishops and Principal Pre∣lates


besides the Bishop of

Rome.
 Divers of our Saxon
and Norman Kings and Nobles
so respected them, that they
constrained them in 
Publick
Grants,
 yet to be seen to 
sign

before the highest of the 
Lay
Nobles,
 and sometimes before
the Kings own Sons and Bro∣thers,
and to rank them be∣fore,

&c.


In the year 1200. three
Kings, 
viz.
 of 
England, Scot∣land,

and of 
South-Wales,
 to
express their pious and cour∣teous
respect to 
Hugh
 Bishop
of 
Lincoln,
 disdained not with
their own 
Royal Shoulders
 to
bear his dead Corps to the
Grave.


And yet it hath been obser∣ved
even by 
Strangers,
 that
the 
Iniquity
 of the 
present times


in England
 is such, that the

English Orthodox Clergy
 are not
only hated by the 
Romanists
 on
the one side, and maligned by
the 
Presbyterian
 on the other
side (as the English 
Liturgy

hath also been for a long time
by both of them (a sure evi∣dence
of the excellency there∣of)
and as our 
Saviour
 was cru∣cified
between two Theeves)
but also that of all the Christi∣an
Clergy of 
Europe
 (whether

Romish, Lutheran,
 or 
Calvini∣an
)
none are so little respected,
beloved, obeyed, or rewarded,
as the present Pious Learned
Loyal Orthodox Clergy of

England,
 even by those who
have alwayes professed them∣selves
of that Communion.

 the Dean of

Bocking, &c.








Of the Nobility or
Second Estate of
England.


NObiles quasi viri Nosci∣biles

or 
Notabiles.
 In
all Christian Monarchies men
that have been 
Notable
 for

Courage, Wisdom, Wealth,
&c.
 have been judged fit and
worthy to enjoy certain 
Privi∣ledges,
Titles, Dignities, Ho∣nours,
&c.
 above the Com∣mon
People, to be placed in
an higher Orbe, and to be as
a 
Skreen
 between the King and
the Inferiour Subjects,
 to de∣fend
the one from Insolencies
and the other from Tyranny; to


interpose by their 
Counsel, Cou∣rage,

and 
Grandeur,
 where com∣mon
persons dare not, ought
not to be so hardy; to support
the King and defend the King∣dom
with their lives and for∣tunes.


The Nobility of 
England
 is
called the 
Peerage
 of 
England,

because they are all 
Pares Reg∣ni;

that is, 
Nobilitate Pares,

though 
gradu impares.


The 
Degrees
 of the English
Nobility are onely five,
 
viz.
Duke, Marquiss, Earl, Vicount,

and 
Baron.
 These are all Ba∣rons,
but the four first are for

State, Priviledge,
 and 
Prece∣dence

above and before other
Barons.


A Duke in Latine 
Dux,
 
a


ducendo,
 Noblemen being an∣tiently
either 
Generals
 and 
Lea∣ders

of Armies in time of War,
or Wardens of Marches and
Governours of Provinces in
times of Peace; afterwards
made so for term of life, then
held by 
Lands
 and 
Fees,
 at
length made 
Hereditary
 and

Titular.


The first 
Duke
 since the
Conquerour was 
Edward
 the

Black Prince,
 created so by

Edward
 3 in the 11th year of
his Raign. A Duke is at this
day created by 
Patent, Cin∣cture
of a Sword, Imposition of
a Cap
 and 
Coronet of Gold
 on
his Head, and a 
Verge
 of 
Gold

put into his hand.


Marchio
 a 
Marquiss,
 was first
so called from the Government


of 
Marches
 and Frontier Coun∣tries.
The first that was so
created was 
Robert Vere Earl
of Oxford,
 made 
Marquiss

of 
Dublin
 in 
Octavo
 of 
Ri∣chard

2.


A Marquiss is created by a

Cincture
 of a 
Sword, Imposi∣tion

of a Cap of 
Honour,
 with a

Coronet
 and delivery of a 
Charter

or 
Patent.


Earls antiently called 
Comi∣tes,


 because they were wont

Comitari Regem,
 to wait upon
the King for Counsel and Ad∣vice.
The 
Saxons
 called them

Ealdormen,
 the 
Danes Eorlas,

and the 
English Earls.
 They
had antiently for the support of
their state the third penny out
of the Sherives Court issuing
out of all 
Pleas
 of that 
Shire



whereof they had their Title,
but now it is otherwise.


An Earl is created by the

Cincture 
of a
 Sword, 
a
 Mantle
of State put upon him by the King
himself, 
a
 Cap and a Coronet
put 
upon his head, and a
 Charter

in his hand.


All Earls are stiled by the
King 
Consanguinei nostri, Our
Cosins,
 and they antiently did
and still may use the style of

Nos.


All the Earls of 
England
 are
local, or denominated from
some Shire Town or Place, ex∣cept
2, whereof one is perso∣nal,
as the Earl Marshal of

England,
 who is not only ho∣norary
as all the rest, but also
officiary. The other is nomi∣nal,

viz.
 Earl 
Rivers,
 who
takes his denomination from


an Illustrious Family, as the rest
do from some noted place.


Vicecomes 
quasi vice Comi∣tis
gubernaturus Comitatum.

This Title was first given say
some by 
Hen.
 6. in the 18th
year of his Raign to 
John Beau∣mont,

though it may be found
that 5 
H.
 5. Sir 
Robert Brent

was by that King created a Vi∣count.


A Vicount is so made by

Patent.


In the Laws of the 
Longo∣bards

and of the 
Normans
 this
Word 
Baron
 was used for 
Vir,

as at this day 
Baron
 or 
Varon
 in
the Spanish Tongue is used for
the same; so that a Baron is

Vir
 
, 
Vir Notabilis
& Principalis;
 so the Chief


Burgesses of 
London
 antiently
and still those of the 
Cinque
Ports
 are called 
Barons.


Antiently those Barons on∣ly
were accounted Peers of the
Realm that held of the King

per integram Baroniam,
 which
consisted of 13 Knights Fees,
and one third part (each Knights
Fee being 20 
l.
) which make
in all 400 Marks, and whoe∣ver
had so much, was wont to
be summoned to Parliament.
Now to hold 
per Baroniam,
 is
to hold 
per haereditatem Baronis

whether greater or less.


Barons in the beginning of
the Raign of 
H.
 3. were not of
so much repute as afterwards,
when that King (after that
great Rebellion against him was
supprest) called by Writ unto
Parliament only such great


men as had continued loyal;
which the succeeding Kings ob∣serving,
they only were ac∣counted
Peers of the Realm,
that were called by the Kings
special Writ; and the others lost
their Peerage.


The Earls Palatines and
Earls Marchers of 
England
 had
antiently also their Barons un∣der
them; as in 
Cheshire
 there
are yet such Barons: but as no
Bishops but those that hold im∣mediately
of the King, are
Peers of the Realm (for the Bi∣shop
of 
Man,
 holding immedi∣ately
of the Earl of 
Derby
 is no
Peer) so no Barons, but
those that hold immediately of
the King, are Peers of the
Realm.


Caput Baroniae
 is some Castle
or Chief Seat of a Nobleman,


which is not to be divided a∣mongst
Daughters (if there be
no Son) but must descend to
the Eldest Daughter, 
caeteris fi∣liabus
aliunde satisfactis.


Lands holden by Barony,
doth not make the purchaser
that is ignoble to be noble, al∣though
the charge of such Te∣nure
doth lie upon him in re∣spect
of the Service of the
Realm; no more than Lands
by Villain Service, doth make
the Purchaser that is a Freeman
a Villain, though he shall there∣by
be bound to his Villain Ser∣vice
due for those Lands.


Barons are sometimes made
by 
Writ,
 being thereby called
to sit in the Higher House of

Parliament,
 but most usually
by 
Patent.



All the fore-mentioned De∣grees
have the Title of 
Lord

from the Saxon word 
Laford,
Dominus.


All the Lords of 
England

both 
Spiritual
 and 
Temporal,

are 
Feudataries
 to the King,
and in their Creation and also
in their Succession, do swear
an 
Oath of Fealty,
 and do 
Ho∣mage

to the King their Sove∣raign,
and pay certain Duties,
as Signs and Symbols of their
Subjection to their 
Prince.


All Honours in 
England
 are
given by the King, who is the
sole Fountain of Honour.


The Law of 
England
 pro∣hibiteth
all Subjects of the
Realm to receive any Title of
Honour or Dignity of the Gift
of any 
Forreign Prince,
 King
or Emperour. 
Est enim jus


Majestatis & inter Insignia sum∣mae
potestatis.


None of these 
Honours
 be∣stowed
by the 
King
 on a 
Fami∣ly

can be lost, but by want of
Issue, or else by some heinous
Crime; and then that Family
cannot be restored to their 
Blood

but by 
Parliament.


All Noblemen at their Cre∣ation
have two Ensigns, to sig∣nifie
two Duties. Their Heads
are adorned 
ad consulendum Re∣gem
& Patriam tempore pacis,

and they are girt with 
a Sword
ad defendendum Regem & Pa∣triam
tempore belli.


The several Degrees of the
English Nobility are differen∣ced
and distinguisht one from
another by their Titles and En∣signs
of Honour.




A
 Duke 
hath the Title of

Grace, 
and being written unto,
may be stiled,
 Most High, Po∣tent,
and Noble Prince. 
A

Marquiss, Most Noble and Po∣tent
Prince. 
An
 Earl, Most
Noble and Potent Lord. 
A
 Vi∣count,
Right Noble and Potent
Lord. 
And, A
 Baron, Right
Noble Lord.


Their Coronets are all diffe∣rent.
A Baron hath a Coro∣net
of 6 Pearls upon the Circle,
given to that honour by the
present King. A Vicount hath
a Coronet with 8 Pearls with∣out
the Circle. 
n 
arls Co∣ronet
hath the Pearls raised.
The Marquiss a Pearl and
Strawbe
ry Leaf round. And
a Dukes Coronet only
Leaves without Pearls. They
are more especially distinguisht


by their 
Robes
 of 
Parlia∣ment,

by their several 
Guards

on their 
Mantles
 or 
Short
Cloaks
 about their Shoulders.
A Baron hath but 2 
Guards,
 a
Vicount two and and a half,
an Earl 3, a Marquiss 3 and a
half, and a Duke 4.


The Nobility of 
England

have in all times enjoyed many
considerable Priviledges.


All Peers of the Realm be∣ing
lookt on as the Kings He∣reditary
constant Counsel∣lours,
their Persons out of Par∣liament
time are priviledged
(as others in Parliament time)
from all arrest, unless for Trea∣son,
Felony, or breach of Peace,
Condemnation in Parliament, or
Contempt to the King. No

Supplicavit
 can be granted a∣gainst


them, No 
Capias
 or 
Ex∣igent

sued out against them for
Actions of 
Debt
 or 
Trespass.

No 
Essoin
 lies against any Peer
of the Realm. In Criminal
Causes, Treason, or Felony,
they cannot be tried by any
other Jury but by a Jury of
Peers of the Realm; who are
not as other Juries to be put to
their Oath, but their Ve
dict gi∣ven
in upon their Honour suffi∣ceth.
In Civil Causes they are
not to be empanelled upon any
Jury, nor upon any Enquests

de facto,
 though in a matter
between two Peers. In case a∣ny
Peer be returned upon any
such Jury, there is a special
Writ for his discharge. Upon
no case to be bound to the good
behaviour, nor put to swear
they will not break the Peace,


but only to promise it upon
their Honour; which was ever
counted so sacred, as upon no
terms to be violated. A Peer
of the Realm may not be put
to the Rack or Torture, to dis∣cover
the truth, though accu∣sed
of High Treason. Every
Peer of the Realm called to
Parliament, hath the Privi∣ledge
in his lawful absence to
constitute a Proxy to vote for
him, which none of the Com∣mons
may do. Also in places
of trust committed to them,
they are allowed to make De∣puties,
by reason of the neces∣sity
supposed in the Law of
their attendance on the Person
of the King. Though neither
Civil Law nor Common Law
allow any others Testimony to
be valid, but what is given up∣on


Oath, yet the Testimony
of a Peer of 
England
 given in
upon his Honour, without any
Oath, is esteemed valid; and
they were wont to be examined
upon their Allegeance and the
Loyalty of their Chivalry, and
to put in their Answer to a
Bill 
super honorem,
 without ta∣king
an Oath; though of later
times that Priviledge, by the
neglect of some Lords hath
been infringed sometimes. A
day of Grace by the favour of
the Court is not to be granted
to the Plaintiff in any Suit or
Action wherein a Peer of the
Realm is Defendant; and this
by Statute Law, because the
Law presumes that a Peer of
the Realm must alwayes be rea∣dy
to attend the Person of the
King and the Service of the


Commonwealth, and there∣fore
it is not to be delayed
longer than the ordinary use of
the Court, but to have expe∣dition
of Justice. At the be∣ginning
of Parliament when
the Oath of Supremacy is ex∣acted
of all those of the House
of Commons, yet is it not re∣qnired
of any of the Lords, be∣cause
the King is otherwise as∣sured
of their Loyalty and Fi∣delity
as is presumed. In all
Cases wherein the Priviledge
of Clergy is allowed to other
men, and also in divers Cases
where that Priviledge is taken
away from other men, every
Peer of the Realm having
Place and Voice in Parlia∣ment,
shall upon his Request
by Stat. 1. 
Ed.
 6. without burn∣ing
in the hand, loss of Inheri∣tance,


or corruption of Blood,
be adjudged for the first time
as a Clerk convict, though he
cannot read.


All Barons of 
England
 are
exempted from all attendance
at 
Sherives Turns
 or any 
Leets,

as others are, to take the Oath
of 
Allegeance.


A Peer cannot be outlawed
in any Civil Action, because
he cannot be arrested by any

Capias,
 and by the same reason
lies no Attachment against him.


By the Custom of 
England,

(as is by the Law of the Em∣pire)

Nobiles non torquentur in
quibus plebeii torquerentur &
Nobiles non suspenduntur sed de∣capitantur:

yet this by the meer
favour of the King, and in some
cases, especially of Felony, hath
been otherwise sometimes.



For the suppressing of Ri∣ots
and Routs, the Sheriff may
raise the 
Posse Comitatus,
 that
is, 
all able men are to assist
him; yet may not the Sheriff
command the Person of any
Peer of the Realm to attend
that Service.


A Baron of Parliament be∣ing
sent for by the Kings Writ
or Letter, or by his Messenger
to come to Court, or to Parlia∣ment,
or to appear before the
Council-Board, or in his
Court of 
Chancery,
 may both
coming and returning by the
Kings Forest or Park kill one or
two Deer.


In any Civil Trial, where a
Peer of the Realm is Plaintiff
or Defendant, there must be
returned of the Jury at least
one Knight, otherwise the Ar∣ray


may be quasht by Chal∣lenge.


The Laws of 
England
 are
so tender of the Honour, Cre∣dit,
Reputation and Persons
of Noblemen, that there is a
Statute on purpose to prohi∣bit
all offence by false reports,
whereby any scandal to their
persons may arise, or debate
and discord between them and
the Commons; and because it
is to defend not only Lay
Lords but Bishops and all great
Officers of the Realm, it is
called 
Scandalum Magnatum.


If a Peer of the Realm ap∣pear
not upon a 
Subpena,
 yet
may not an Attachment be a∣warded
against him, as it may
against a common person;
though of later times the pra∣ctice
hath been otherwise.



The House of a Peer can∣not
in some Cases (as in search
for Prohibited Books, for
Conventicles, 
&c.
) be en∣
red
by Officers of Justice,
without a Warrant under the
Kings own hand, and the hands
of 6 of his Privy Council,
whereof 4 to be Peers of the
Realm.


No Peer can be assessed to∣wards
the standing 
Militia,
 but
by 6 or more of themselves.


The Law allowing any one
of the Commonalty to be ar∣
aigned
for Felony or Treason

in favorem vitae
 to challenge 35
of his Jury without shewing
cause, and others by shewing
cause; yet allows not a Peer of
the Realm to challenge any of
his Jury, or to put any of them
to their Oath, the Law pre∣suming


that they being all
Peers of the Realm, and judg∣ing
upon their Honour, can∣not
be guilty of Falshood o

Favour or Malice.


All Peers of the Realm have
a Priviledge of qualifying a cer∣tain
number of Chaplains,
who (after a Dispensation from
the Archbishop (if to him i

seem good) and the same rati∣fied
under the Great Seal of

England
) may hold Plurality
of Benefices with Cure of
Souls: In this manner every
Duke may qualifie 6 Chap∣lains,
every Marquiss and Earl
5 apiece, every Vicount 4, and
every Baron 3.


A Peer of the Realm may
retain 6 Aliens born, whereas
another may not retain above
4.



In Case of Amercements of
the Peers of the Realm upon
Non-suits or other Judge∣ments,
a Duke is to be amer∣
ed
only 10 pounds, and all
under only 5 
l.
 and this to be
done by their Peers, accord∣
ng
to 
Magna Charta;
 al∣
hough
it is oft done by the
Kings Justices instead of their
Peers.


All Peers of the Realm be∣
ng
constant hereditary Coun∣cellours
of the King in his
Great Council of Parliament,
and being obliged upon the
Kings Summons to appear
and attend in all Parliaments
upon their own Charges, are
priviledged from contributing
to the Expences of any Mem∣ber
of the House of Commons;
for which no levy may be made


upon any of their Lands, par∣cel
of their Earldoms or Ba∣ronies,
any of their antient
Demesnes, Copyhold, or Vil∣lain
Tenants.


The Estates of all Peers of
the Realm being judged in the
Eye of the Law sufficient at
all times to satisfie all Debts
and Damages, satisfaction is
to be sought by Execution ta∣ken
forth upon their Lands and
Goods, and not by Attach∣ments,
Imprisonments of their
Persons (those are to be al∣wayes
free for the Service of
the King and Kingdome) no

by Exigents or 
Capias Utlega∣tum,
&c.


Other Priviledges belong
to the Peers of 
England,
 as 8

Tun of Wine Custome free
to every Earl, and to the rest
proportionably, 
&c.



Notwithstanding these great
Priviledges belonging to the
Nobility of 
England,
 yet the
greatest of them (no not the
Brother or Son of the King)
ever had the Priviledge of the
Grandees of 
Spain,
 to be co∣vered
in the Kings Presence,
except only 
Henry Ratcliffe

Earl of 
Surrey,
 as before 
Pag.

147. nor had ever that higher
Priviledge of the Nobility of

France,
 whose Domain Lands
and their Dependants holding
them, are exempted from all
Contributions and Tailles,
whereby they are tied to their
King, and so enabled to serve
him, that although Rebelli∣ons
are frequent, yet seldome
of long continuance, and ne∣ver
prosperous; whereas the
highest born Subject of 
Eng∣land



hath herein no more Pri∣viledge
than the meanest Plow∣man,
but utterly want that
kind of reward for antient Ver∣tue,
and encouragement for
future Industry.


Touching the Places or Pre∣cedences
amongst the Peers of

England,
 it is to be observed
that (after the King and Prin∣ces
of the Blood, 
viz.
 the Sons,
Grandsons, Brothers, Uncles,
or Nephews of the King and no

farther) Dukes amongst the
Nobility have the first place,
then Marquisses, Dukes eldest
Sons, Earls, Marquisses eldest
Sons, Dukes younger Sons,
Vicounts, Earls eldest Sons,
Marquisses younger Sons, Ba∣rons,
Vicounts eldest Sons,
Earls younger Sons, Barons


eldest Sons, Vicounts younger
Sons, Barons younger Sons.


Here note, That it was de∣creed
by King 
James,
 that
the younger Sons of Barons
and Vicounts should yeeld
Place and Precedence to all
Knights of the Garter, 
quate∣
us
tales,
 and to all Privy
Councellours, Master of the
Wards, Chancellour, and Un∣der
Treasurer of the 
Exche∣quer,

Chancellour of the
Dutchy, Chief Justice of the
Kings Bench, Master of the
Rolls, Chief Justice of the
Common Pleas, Chief Baron
of the 
Exchequer,
 and all o∣ther
Judges and Barons of the
Degree of the Coise of the
said Courts, and that by rea∣son
of their Honourable Order
and Employment; and also to


all Bannerets made under the
Kings Banner or Standard di∣splayed
in an Army Royal in
open War, and the King per∣sonally
present.


Note also, That if any of
the Degrees of Nobility a∣bove-mentioned
are descended
of the Blood Royal, they are
to have place of all those of the
same Degree with them.


Moreover, Observe that all
the Nobles of the same Degree
take place according to the Se∣niority
of their Creation.


There are certain Marks of
State that belong to each De∣gree
amongst the Nobility,

which they may practise or not
practise at pleasure.



A Duke may have in all pla∣ces
out of the Kings presence a
Cloth of Estate hanging down
within half a yard of the
ground, so may his Dutchess,
and her Train born up by a Ba∣ron;
and no Earl to wash with
a Duke without the Dukes
pleasure.


A Marquiss may have a
Cloth of Estate reaching
within a yard of the ground,

and that in all places out of the
presence of the King or a Duke,
and his Marchioness to have her
Train born by a Knights Wife;
and no Vicount to wash with a
Marquiss, but at his pleasure.


An Earl also may have a
Cloth of Estate without Pen∣dants



but only Fringe, and a
Countess may have her Train
born by a Gentlewoman out of
the presence of her Superiours,
and in their presence by a Gen∣tleman.


A Vicount may have a Co∣ver
of Assay holden under his
Cup while he drinks,
 but no
Assay taken, as Dukes, Mar∣quisses
and Earls may have.
And a Vicountess may have
her Gown born up by a Wo∣man
out of the presence of her
Superiours, and in their presence
by a Man.


A Baron may also have the
Cover of his Cup holden un∣derneath
whilst he drinketh,
 and
a Baroness may have her Gown
born up by a man in the pre∣sence
of a Vicountess.



All Dukes eldest Sons be as
Earls, and the younger as Lords,
with the addition of their Chri∣stian
Names, as Lord 
Thomas,

Lord 
John, &c.


A Dukes eldest Son of the
Blood Royal shall take place of
a Marquiss that is not, and of
an Earl that is of the Blood
Royal.


A Marquisses eldest Son is
called Lord of a place, and the
younger Sons Lord 
Thomas,

Lord 
John, &c.


A Marquisses eldest Son of
the Blood Royal shall go be∣fore
an Earl that is not, and of
a Vicount that is of the Blood
Royal.


An Earls eldest Son is called
Lord of a place, and all his
Daughters Ladies, but his
younger Sons not Lords.



An Earls eldest Son of the
Blood Royal takes place of a
Vicount that is not, and of a
Lord that is of the Blood
Royal.


A Vicounts eldest Son is no
Lord, nor his Daughters La∣dies,
and therefore the eldest
Son and the eldest Daughter
of the first Vicount of 
England,

is said to be the first Gentleman
and Gentlewoman without Ti∣tle
in 
England.


A Vicounts eldest Son of
the Blood Royal takes place of
all Barons.


The Princes of the Blood,
the Great Officers of the
Realm, and the Bishops are to
precede, according to an Act
of Parliament, 31 
H.
 8.


The Lord Chancellour, Lord
Treasurer, Lord President of


the Kings Council, Lord Privy
Seal: These being Barons or a∣bove,
shall in Parliament sit a∣bove

Of Temporal Lords or Peer
of 
England,
 there are at presen

about 170, whereof there ar

10 Dukes, 3 Marquisses, 6

Earls, 8 Vicounts, and 78 Ba∣rons;
whereas within 60 year

last past there was not on

Duke, but one Marquiss, abou

20 Earls, 3 or 4 Vicounts, an

40 Lords.



The Laws and Customs of

England
 alwayes willing that

Decorum
 and Conveniency
should be every where observed,

and considering the Charges and
Expences appertaining to the
several Degrees of Honour, as
they belong to Men of Principal
Service to the King and Realm,
both in time of War and Peace,
expected that each of them
should have a convenient Estate
and Value of Lands of Inheri∣tance,
for the support of their
Honours and the Kings Service.
Therefore antiently when the
intrinsique value of a Pound

Sterling
 was worth 30 
l.
 of our
Money now, every Knight
was to have about 800 Acres,
reckoned at 20 
l.
 yearly in
Land, that is, about 600 
l.
 of


our Money at this day: A Ba∣ron
to have 13 Knights Fees
and one third part, which a∣mounted
to 400 
l.
 which mul∣tiplied
by 30, was as much as
8000 
l.
 a year at this day. An
Earl 20 Knights Fees, and a
Duke 40. And in case of de∣cay
of Nobility, or that they
had so far wasted their Reve∣nues,
that their Honours could
not decently be maintained (as
the Roman Senators were in
such case removed from the
Senate) so sometimes some
English Barons have not been
admitted to sit in the Higher
House of Parliament, though
they kept the Name and Title
of Dignity still.


For the better support o

these Degrees of Honour, the
King doth usually upon the


Creation of a Duke, Marquiss,
Earl, or Vicount, grant an
Annuity or yearly Rent to
them and their heirs, which is
so annext to the Dignity that
by no Grant, Assurance, or a∣ny
manner of Alienation can be
given from the same, but is still

ncident to, and a support of the
same Creation; contrary to
that Principle in Law, 
That e∣very
Land of Feesimple may be
charged with a Rent in Fee∣simple
by one way or other.


To a Duke the King grants
40 
l.
 heretofore a considera∣ble
Pension, to a Marquiss 40
Marks, to an Earl 20 
l.
 and
to a Vicount 20 Marks. To
Barons no such Pensions is or∣dinarily
granted, onely the
late King creating 
Mountjoy
Blount
 (the late Earl of 
New∣port
)


Lord 
Mountjoy
 of 
Thurl∣ston,

granted him a Fee of 20
Marks 
per annum
 to him and
his heirs for ever.


As the King of 
England
 hath
ever had the repute of the
richest in Domaines of any King
in 
Europe,
 so the Nobility of

England
 have been accounted
the richest in Lands of any
Neighbouring Nation; some
having above 20000 
l.
 yearly,
others 15000, and so many of
them above ten, that if one
with another they have 10000

l.
 yearly, it will amount to in
all amongst the 160 Lords Six∣teen
hundred thousand pounds
a year, about the ninth part of
the yearly Revenue of all 
Eng∣land,

which upon Computa∣tion
is found to be about Four∣teen
Millions yearly.



The English Nobility for
Valour, Wisdome, Integrity,

nd Honour, hath in all for∣mer
Ages been equal to any in
Christendom.


Every Lords House was a
kind of a well disciplined
Court, insomuch that the
Gentry, Males, and Females,
were wont to be sent thither
for vertuous breeding and re∣turned
excellently accom∣plisht.


At home their Table Atten∣dance,
Officers, Exercises, Re∣creations,
Garb, was an Ho∣nour
to the Nation.


Abroad they were attended
with as brave, numerous, and
uniform Train of Servants and
Followers as any 
u
ope;
 not
thinking it consistent with their
Honours to be seen walk the


Streets almost in 
Cuerpo
 with
one Lackey, or not that, much
less to be found drinking in a
Tavern, 
&c.


If the English Nobility by 

long continued Peace, exces∣sive
Luxury in Diet, want o

Action, 
&c.
 were before th

late Wars born more feeble in
body than their Ancestors, an

by too fine and too full Die

afterwards were rendred weak∣er
in mind, and then during th

late troubles by much licenti∣ousness
and want of fit Educa∣tion,
were so debauched, tha

it was lately difficult to fin

(as some are bold to affirme)
the Courage, Wisdom, Inte∣grity,
Honour, Sobriety, and
Courtesie of the Antient No∣bility;
yet is it not to be doubt∣ed,
but that under a Warlike


Enterprising Prince all those
Vertues of their Fore-Fathers
may spring afresh: especially if
we consider the vicissitude of
all sublunary things, and re∣member
that there was once
a time when the 
Juvenes No∣biles,

in Old English the 
Edel
Knaben,
 were so 
leud,
 that
those words came at length to
signifie, as now, 
Idle Knaves.






Of the Commonalty
or Third State of
England.


THe Law of 
England,
 con∣trary
to the Laws and
Customs of other Countries,

alleth none Noble under a


Baron; so that not only all Ba∣ronets,
all sorts of Knights,
all Esquires and Gentlemen,
but also all the Sons of the No∣bility,
are by our Law reckon∣ed
amongst the 
Commons
 of

England:
 and therefore the el∣dest
Son of a Duke, though
by the 
Courtesie
 of 
England
 sti∣led
an Earl, yet shall be ar∣raigned
by the Stile of Esquire
only, and may be tried by a
Jury of 
Common Freeholders;

and in Parliament can sit only in
the 
House of Commons,
 if ele∣cted,
till called by the 
Kings
Writ
 to the 
Lords House.
 Yet
doth it seem very absurd that
all Noblemens Sons, with all
Knights, Esquires, and Gentle∣men,
should be esteemed 
Plebe∣ans,

but rather as in 
Rome
 they
were, in a middle Rank, 
inter


Senatores & Plebem;
 or else as

n other Christian Kingdomes,
they should be considered as

he 
Minor Nobilitas Regni:
 so

hat as Barons and all above,
may be stiled 
Nobiles Majores;


o from a Baron downward to

he Yeoman, all may be not

fitly, stiled 
Nobiles Minores.


The Lower Nobility then
of 
England
 consists of Baro∣
ets,
Knights, Esquires, and
Gentlemen.


The next Degree to Barons

re Baronets,
 which is the low∣
st
Degree of Honour that is

ereditary. An Honour first

nstituted by King 
James Anno

611,
 given by Patent to a
Man and his Heirs Males of his
Body lawfully begotten; for

hich each one is obliged to

ay into the 
Exchequer
 so much


money as will for 3 years at 8


d. per diem,
 pay 30 Foot Souldi∣ers
to serve in the Province o


Vlster
 in 
Ireland,
 which summe
amounts to 1095 
l.
 which with
Fees doth commonly arise to
1200 
l.


Baronets have precedenc

before all Knights excep

Knights of the Garter and
Knights Bannerets, made un∣der
the Kings Banner or Stand∣ard,
displaied in an 
Army Roya

in open War, and the Kin

personally present.


Baronets have the Priviledgi
to bear in a Canton of thei

Coat of Arms, or in a whol

Scutcheon the Arms of 
Vlster
viz.
 In 
a Field Argent a Han

Gules:
 also in the Kings Ar∣mies
to have place in the gros
near the Kings Standard, wit



some other particulars for their
Funerals.


The whole number of Baro∣nets
in 
England
 are not to ex∣ceed
200 at one and the same
time; after which number com∣pleated,
as any for want of
heirs come to be extinct, the
number shall not be made up by
new Creations, but be suffered
to diminish; as appears by their
Patent.


No Honour is ever to be cre∣ated
between Baronets and Ba∣rons.


The first Baronet that was
created, was Sir 
Nicholas Ba∣con

of 
Suffolk;
 whose Succes∣sor
is therefore stiled 
Primus
Baronettorum Angliae.


This Word 
Knight
 is deri∣ved
from the German Word




Knecht
 signifying originally 


Lusty Servitor.


The Germans (as the anti∣ent
Romans gave their young
men 
Togam Virilem
) by Pub∣lick
Authority bestowed on
their young men able to ma∣nage
Arms) a Shield and a
Javelin, as fit for Martial Ser∣vice,
and to be a Member of the
Common wealth, accounted
before but a part of a Family;
and such a young man publick∣ly
allowed, they called 
Knecht:

whence we had our Institution
of Knighthood.


The thing 
Knight
 is at this
day signified in 
Latine, French,
Spanish, Italian,
 and also in
the 
High
 and 
Low Dutch

Tongues, by a Word that pro∣perly
signifies a 
Horseman,
 be∣cause
they were wont to serve


in War on Horsback; and
were sometimes in 
England
 cal∣led

Radenyhts, id est, Riding
Servitors;
 yet our 
Common
Law
 stiles them 
Milites,
 be∣cause
they commonly held
Lands in Knights Service to
serve the King in his Wars as
Soldiers.


The Honour of Knighthood
is commonly given for some
personal desert, and therefore
dies with the person deserving,
and descends not to his Son.


In 
England
 there are several
sorts of Knights, whereof the
chiefest are those of the Order
of 
St. George,
 commonly cal∣led

Knights of the Garter.


This Order is esteemed the
most Honourable and most An∣tient
of any now in use in 
Chri∣stendom.

It began as appears in


the Statutes of this Order in
the 23th year of the Warlike
and Puissant King 
Edward
 3,
who was Founder thereof, and
at first made choice of the most
Illustrious Persons of 
Europe,

to be of that 
Royal Society
 (no
doubt) upon a Martial, and not
upon any such Amorous Ac∣count,
as is intimated 
Page
 96
of this Treatise, which ridicu∣lous
Story, to the dishonour of
the Order, was first fancied by

Polydore Virgil;
 and since upon
his credit taken up by many
late Authors.


It appears by Antient Wri∣tings
that this Honourable
Company is a Colledge or
Corporation, having a Great
Seal belonging to it, and con∣sisting
of a Soveraign Guardian


(which is alwayes the King of

England
) and of 25 Compa∣nions
called 
Knights of the Gar∣ter,

of 14 Secular Canons, that
are Priests, of 13 Vicars who
are also Priests; of 26 poor
Knights, who have no other
Maintenance but the allowance
of this Colledge, which is gi∣ven
them in respect of their
Prayers, to the Honour of God
and of St. 
George,
 who is the
Patron of 
England
 and of this
Order in particular; and is none
of those Fabulous St. 
Georges

as some have vainly fancied;
but that famous Saint and Sol∣dier
of Christ St. 
George
 of 
Cap∣padocia,

a Saint so universally
received in all Parts of 
Chri∣stendom,

so generally attested
by the Ecclesiastical Writers of
all Ages from the time of his


Martyrdome till this day, that
no one Saint in all the Calen∣dar
(except those attested by
Scripture) can be better eviden∣ced.


There be also certain Offi∣cers
belonging to this Order,
as the Prelate of the Garter,
which Office is settled on the
Bishoprick of 
VVinchester.
 A
Chancellour of the Garter, A
Register, who of later times
hath been constantly the Dean
of 
VVindsor,
 though antiently
it was otherwise. The Princi∣pal
King at Arms called 
Gar∣ter,

whose chief function is to
manage and marshal their So∣lemnities
at their Installations
and Feasts. Lastly, The Usher
of the Garter.


There are also certain Orders
and Constitutions belonging to


this Society touching the So∣lemnities
in making these
Knights, their Duties after
Creation, and their high Pri∣viledges,
too long for this
place.


The Colledge is seated in
the Castle of 
VVindsor,
 with
the Chappel of St. 
George,

there erected by King 
Edward

3. and the Chapter House.


The Order of the Garter is
wont to be bestowed upon the
most excellent and renowned
Persons for Honour and Ver∣tue;
and with it a Blew Garter
deckt with Gold, Pearl, and
Pretious Stones, and a Buckle
of Gold, to be worn daily on
the Left Leg; also at High
Feasts they are to wear a Sur∣coat,
a Mantle, a Black Vel∣vet
Cap, a Coller of Garters,


and other stately and magnifi∣cent
Apparel.


They are not to be seen a∣broad
without their Garter up∣on
the Left Leg, upon pain of
paying 2 Crowns to any Offi∣cer
of the Order who shall first
claim it; onely in taking a
Journey a Blew Ribon under
the Boot doth suffice.


Upon the Left Shoulder,
upon Cloak, Coat, or Riding
Cassack in all places of Assem∣bly,
when they wear not their
Robes, they are to wear an
Escutcheon of the Arms of
St. 
George,
 that is, a Cross
with a Garter, and this by an
Order made 
April
 1626. That
Ornament and Embellishment
about the said Escutcheon now
worn, and called the Star or ra∣ther
the Sun in its glory; was at
the same time enjoyned. The



The greatest Monarchs of

Christendome
 have been enrol∣led,
and have taken it for an
Honour to be of this Order.


There have been of this Or∣der
since the Institution 8 Em∣perours,
25 or 26 Forreign
Kings, besides many Soveraign
Princes, 
&c.




The Fellows and Compani∣ons
of the Most Noble
Order of St. George, are
at present these that fol∣low,
ranked according as
they are seated in their
several Stalls at Wind∣sor.


IN the first Stall on the right
hand is the 
Soveraigne
 of
the Order King 
Charles
 the


Second, who is Patron and Sole
Disposer of the Order.


The Stall opposite to His
Majesty is now void.


In the other Stalls on the

Sovereign
 Side are thus placed
these that follow: 2 The
Duke of 
York,
 3 Prince 
Ru∣pert,

4 Marquiss of 
Branden∣bourgh,

5 Earl of 
Salisbury,

6 Earl of 
Northumberland,

7 Duke of 
Buckingham,
 8 Earl
of 
Bristol,
 9 Count 
Marsin,

10 Earl of 
Sandwich,
 11 Duke
of 
Richmond,
 12 Earl of 
Straf∣ford,

13th Stall is void. On
the other side, opposite to
these afore-named, are placed
in this Order these that follow:
2 Prince Elector 
Palatine,

3 Prince of 
Orenge,
 4 Prince
of 
Denmark,
 5 Earl of 
Berk∣shire,

6 Duke of 
Ormond,



7 Duke of 
Newcastle,
 8 Prince
of 
Tarent,
 9 Duke of 
Albe∣marle,

10 Earl of 
Oxford,

11 Earl of 
Manchester,
 12 Duke
of 
Monmouth,
 13th Stall on
this Side also is void.


The whole number of Fel∣lows
of this Order is not to ex∣ceed
26.


In the next place are 
Knights
Bannerets,
 
Equites Vexilliferi,

antiently a high Honour, now
obsolete; there being at this
time none of this Order in 
Eng∣land.


These may bear Supporters
of their Arms, and none un∣der
this Degree.


Knights of the Bath,
 so cal∣led
of their 
Bathing
 used before
they are created. The first of


this sort were made by 
Henry

4th. 
Anno
 1399. They are
now commonly made at the
Coronation of a King or
Queen, or Installation of 

Prince of 
VVales.
 They wea

a Scarlet Ribon Belt-wise
They are still made with much
Ceremony, too long here to
be described.


Other Knights called 
Equi∣tes
Aurati,
 from the Gilt Spurs
usually put upon them, and
Knights Batchelors, 
quasi Bas∣chevaliers,

Knights of lower
Degree: So Bachelors in Arts
or Divinity, 
quasi
 Low
Knights or Servitors in Arts.
These were antiently made by
girding with a Sword and Gilt
Spurs, and was bestowed one∣ly
upon Sword men for their


Military Service, and was re∣
uted
an excellent and glorious
Degree, and a Noble Reward

or Courageous Persons; but

f late being made more com∣mon,
and bestowed upon

own Men, contrary to the

ature of the thing (as Degrees

n the University are sometimes

estowed upon Sword men) it

s become of much less reputa∣
ion.
Yet amongst Gown men

 is given only to Lawyers and

hysitians, and not to Divines,

ho may as well become that
Dignity, and be Spiritual
Knights as well as Spiritual
Lords.


These are now made with no
other Ceremony but kneeling
down, the King with a drawn
Sword lightly toucheth them on
the Shoulder, after which here∣tofore


the King said in French

Sois Chevalier au nom de Dieu

and then 
Avances Chevalier.


When a Knight is to suffe

death for any foul Crime, hi

Military Girdle is first to be un∣girt,
his Sword taken away, hi

Spurs cut off with an Hatchet

his Gantlet pluckt off, and hi

Coat of Arms reversed.


Next amongst the Lowe

Nobility are 
Esquires,
 so cal∣led
from the French word 
Es∣cuyers,
Scutigeri,
 because they
were wont to bear before the
Prince in War, or before the
better sort of Nobility 

Shield, or else perhaps because
they bear a Coat of Arms as
Ensigns of their descent; and
by our Lawyers are called 
Ar∣migeri.



Of this Title are first all Vi∣counts
eldest Sons, and all Vi∣counts
and Barons younger
Sons; and by the Common
Law of 
England
 all the Sons
of Earls, Marquisses, and Dukes,
are Esquires and no more. Next
are the Esquires of the Kings
Body, mentioned among the
Officers of the Kings Court;
after these are reckoned Knights
eldest Sons, and their eldest
Sons for ever; then younger
Sons of the elder Sons of Ba∣rons;
next Esquires created by
the King by putting about their
Necks a Collar of Esses, and
bestowing on them a pair of Sil∣ver
Spurs. Lastly, any that
are in superiour Publick Of∣fice
for King or State, are re∣puted
Esquires, or equal to E∣squires,
as Justices of the Peace,


Mayors of Towns, so Councel∣lours
at Law, Batchelors of Di∣vinity,
Law, or Physick, al∣though
none of them really are
so.


In the last place,
 among th

lower Nobility are accounted
the Gentry of 
England,
 that
have no other Title, but are
descended of antient Families
that have alwayes born a Coa

of Arms.


This Kind of Honour is de∣rived
from the Germans to the
rest of 
Christendome,
 and was
never known in any Countrey
where the German Customs
were unknown, as in 
Asia, A∣frica,

and 
America.
 The Ger∣mans
antiently warring oft a∣mongst
themselves, painted
their Scutcheons with the


Picture of some Beast, Bird, or
other thing for distinction,
and put some eminent and vi∣sible
Mark upon the Crest of
their Helmets, and this Orna∣ment
both of Arms and Crest
descended by inheritance to
their Children, to the eldest
pure, and to the rest with some
note of distinction, such as the
Old Master of Ceremonies, in
High Dutch 
Here-alt,
 now 
He∣rald

thought fit.


Gentlemen well descended
and well qualified, have al∣wayes
been of such repute in

England,
 that none of the
higher Nobility, no nor the
King himself, have thought it
unfitting to make them some∣times
their Companions.


The Title of Gentleman in

England
 (as of Cavalier in



France, Italy,
 and 
Spain
) is
not disdained by any Noble∣man.
All Noblemen are Gen∣tlemen,
though all Gentlemen
are not Noblemen.


The State of Gentry was an∣tiently
such, that it was ac∣counted
an abasing of Gentry
to put their Sons to get their
Living by Shop-keeping, and
our Law did account it a dispa∣ragement
of a Ward in Chi∣valry
to be married to a Shop∣keepers
Daughter, or to any
meer Citizen; for Tradesmen
in all Ages and Nations have
been reputed ignoble, in regard
of the doubleness of their
Tongue, without which they
cannot grow rich (for 
Nihil
proficiunt nisi admodum menti∣untur,

as 
Tully
 observed) and
therefore amongst the 
Thebans



no man was admitted to places
of Honour or Trust, unless he
had left off trading ten years
before: So by the Imperial
Laws a Tradesman is not ca∣pable
of any Honourable Estate,
nor to be a Commander over
Souldiers; and therefore the
English Nobility and Gentry
till within late years, judged it a
stain and diminution to the ho∣nour
and dignity of their Fa∣milies,
to seek their Childrens
support by Shop-keeping, but
only (as in all great Monarchies)
by Military, Court, State, or
Church Emploiments, much
less to subject their Children
to an Apprentisage, a perfect
Servitude; for during that
time, whatever they gain by
their Masters Trade or their
own wit, belongs all to their


Master, neither can they lie our
of their Masters House, no

take a Wife, nor trade of their
own, but subject to all Hou∣shold
Work, all Commands o

their Master, undergo what pu∣nishment,
and eat and wear
what their Master pleaseth;
which Marks of Slavery consi∣dered,
Heralds are of opinion
that a Gentleman thereby lo∣ses
his Gentility for ever, till
he can otherwise recover it;
and yet to the shame of our
Nation we have seen of fare
not onely the Sons of Baroners,
Knights, and Gentlemen, sit∣ting
in Shops, and sometimes
of Pedling Trades, far more fit
for Women and their Daugh∣ters,
but also an Earl of this
Kingdom subjecting his Son
to an Apprentisage and Trade;


but the folly of the English in
swerving from their Ancestors
steps herein (as in other things)
is now apparent, for those young
Gentlemen possessing more
noble and active Spirits, could
not brook such dull slavish
lives, and being thereby unfit∣ted
for other emploiments,
have generally taken ill debau∣ched
courses.






Priviledges.


The lower Nobility of 
Eng∣land

have fewer and lesse Pri∣viledges
than those in other
Monarchies.


Some few Priviledges belong
to Knights, 
quatenus
 Knights.

 a Knight be a 
Minor,
 yet
shall he be out of Wardship
both for Lands, Body, and
Marriage; for though the Law
doth judge him not able to do


Knights Service till the Age of
21 years, yet the King being
Sovereign and Supreme Judge
of Chivalry, by dubbing him
Knight, doth thereby allow
him to be able to do him
Knights Service.


Knights are excused from at∣tendance
at Court-Leets.


They and their eldest Sons
not compellable to find Pled∣ges
at the 
Visus Franci Plegii.


Knights by 
Magna Charta
cap.
 21. are so freed, that no
Demesne Cart of theirs may
be taken.


The Son and Brother of a
Knight, by Statute law, are capa∣citated
to hold more than one Be∣enfice
with cure of Souls.


By the Stat. 
Primo Jacobi

It seems that Knights and their
Sons (though they cannot


spend 10 
l. per annum,
 nor are
worth 200 
l.
 may keep Grey∣hounds,
Setting Dogs, or Nets
to take Pheasants or Par∣tridges.


Some Priviledges also be∣
ong
to Gentlemen. Antient∣
y
if an ignoble person did

trike a Gentleman in 
England,

he was to lose his hand.


A Gentleman by Stat.

Quint. Eliz.
 may not be com∣
elled
to serve in Husbandry.


The Child of a Gentleman

rought up to singing, cannot

e taken without the Parents

nd Friends consent, to serve

n the 
Kings Chappel,
 as others
may.


The Horse of a Gentleman,
may not be taken to ride post.




Note,
 That as there are som

Great Officers of the Crown

who for their Dignity an

Worth of their Places; al∣though
they are not Noble
men, yet take place among

the highest of the Higher No∣bility;
so there are some Per∣sons
who for their Digni∣ties
in the Church-degrees i

the University Offices, in th

State or Army, although th

are neither Knights nor Gentle∣men
born, yet take place a∣mongst
them. So all Dean

Archdeacons, Chancellours
Prebends, Doctors of Divi∣nity,
Law, and Physick
Heads of Houses in the Uni∣versity,
usually take place nex

to Knights, and before all Es∣quires
and Gentlemen.



Likewise all Judges of
Courts, Mayors, Bailiffs, Ju∣stices
of the Peace.


All Commissionated Officers
in the Army, as Colonels, Ma∣ster
of Artillery, Quarter-Ma∣ster
General, 
&c.


All higher Officers in the
Kings Court or State.


All Sergeants at Law, 
&c.

These are wont to precede Es∣quires.


All Batchelors of Divinity,
Law, and Physick, all Doctors
in the Arts, commonly called
Masters of Art, all Barresters
in the Innes of Court, all Cap∣tains,
Officers in the Kings
Houshold, 
&c.
 may equal, if
not precede, Gentlemen, that
have none of those qualifica∣tions.



In 
England
 Gentry (as in

Germany
 all Nobility) and
Arms are held in 
Gavelkind,

descending to all the Sons alike,
only the eldest Son beareth
Arms without difference, which
the younger may not.


Of the low Nobility in 
Eng∣land

the number is so great,
that there are reckoned at pre∣sent
above 500 Baronets more
than the first intended number;
that is in all above 700, who
are possest one with another of
about 1200 
l.
 a year in Lands.
Of Knights above 1400, who
one with another may have a∣bout
800 
l.
 Lands a year. Of
Esquires and Gentlemen above
6000, each one possest one
with another of about 400 
l.
 a
year in Lands, besides younger


Brothers, whose number may
amount to about 16000 in all

England,
 who have small E∣states
in Lands, but are com∣monly
bred up to Divinity,
Law, Physick, to Court, and
Military Emploiments, but of
late too many of them to Shop-keeping.


The Lands in the possession
of the lower Nobility will a∣mount
to about four Millions
and sixty thousand pounds
yearly.


Next to the lower Nobility
and the first Degree of the
Commons or Plebeans are the
Freeholders in 
England,
 com∣monly
called Yeomen from the
High Dutch 
Gemen
 or 
Gemain,

in English Common, so in the
Kings Court it signifieth an


Officer, which is in a middle
place between a Sergeant and a
Groom, or else from the Low
Dutch 
Yeman, Some-body,
 as
the Spaniard calls a Gentleman

Hidalgo, Hijo d' algo,
 that is,

the Son of Some-body.


The Yeomanry of 
England

having Lands of their own to a
good value, and living upon
Husbandry, are lookt upon as
not apt to commit or omit any
thing that may endanger their
Estates and Credits, nor apt
to be corrupted or suborned,

&c.
 wherefore they are judged
fit to bear some Offices, as of
Constable, Churchwarden, to
serve upon Juries, to be Train-Souldiers,
to vote in the Ele∣ction
of Knights of the Shire
for Parliament, 
&c.



In Cases and Causes the Law
of 
England
 hath conceived a
better opinion of the Yeoman∣ry
that occupy Lands, then of
Tradesmen, Artificers, or La∣bourers.


Husbandry hath in no age
rendred a Gentleman ignoble
nor uncapable of places of Ho∣nour.


Amongst the Romans some
of the greatest Dictators and
Consuls had been once Hus∣bandmen,
and some of them
taken from Plowing their
Ground, to bear those Highest
Offices and Dignities; so di∣vers
Princes, Kings, and Em∣perours,
have exercised Agri∣culture,
and the Grand 
Scip
o

and the Emperour 
Dioclesian

left their Commands to enjoy
Husbandry.



By the Statutes of 
England

certain Immunities are given to
Freeholders and landed men,
though they are not Gentle∣men:

Vide Stat. 1 Jacobi, cap.
27. & alibi.


Of the Free-holders in 
Eng∣land

there are more in number
and richer than in any Coun∣trey
of the like extent in 
Eu∣rope,

40 or 50 
l.
 a year a piece
is very ordinary, 100 and 200 
l.
 a
year in some Counties is not rare.


Besides these Freeholders
(which are so called, because
they hold Lands or Tenements
inheritable by a perpetual Right
to them and their heirs for ever)
there are in 
England
 a very
great number of Copyholders,
who hold Lands within some
Mannors only by Copy of
Court Roll of the said Man∣nour,



&c.
 & have 
Jus perpetuum
& utile Dominium,
 though not

Allodium & directum Domini∣um,

which none in 
England

but the King hath.


Amongst the Commons of

England
 in the next place are
reckoned Tradesmen, amongst
whom Merchants of Forrein
Trafick have for their great be∣nefit
to the publick, & for their
great Endowments and gene∣rous
living been of best repute
in 
England,
 and although the
Law of 
England
 look upon
Tradesmen and Chapmen that
live by buying and selling as a
baser sort of people, and that
a Ward within age may bring
his Action of Disparagement
against his Guardian for offering
any such in Marriage; yet in

England
 as well as 
Italy
 to be∣come


a Merchant of Forreign
Commerce, without serving
any Apprentisage, hath been
allowed as no disparagement
to a Gentleman born, especi∣ally
to a younger Brother.


Amongst Tradesmen in the
next place are Whole-sale∣men;
then Retailers, lastly
Mechanicks or Handy-crafts∣men.
These are all capable
of bearing some Sway or Of∣fice
in Cities and Towns Cor∣porate.


The lowest Member, the
Feet of the Body Politique, are
the Day-Labourers; who by
their large Wages given them,
and the cheapness of all Neces∣saries,
enjoy better Dwellings,
Diet, and Apparel in 
England,

than the Husbandmen do in
many other Countries.










Liberties and Properties.


As the Clergy and Nobili∣ty
have certain Priviledges pe∣culiar
to themselves, so they
have Liberties and Properties
common to the Commonalty
of 
England.


The Commons of 
England

for hereditary fundamental Li∣berties
and Properties are blest
above and beyond the Sub∣jects
of any 
Monarch
 in the
World.


First, No Freemen of 
Eng∣land

ought to be imprisoned or
otherwise restrained, without
cause shewn for which by Law
he ought to be so imprisoned.


Secondly, To him that is
imprisoned, may not be denied
a Writ of 
Habeas Corpus,
 if it be
desired.



Thirdly, If no cause of Im∣prisonment
be alledged, and
the same be returned upon an

Habeas Corpus,
 then the Pri∣soner
ought to be set at Li∣berty.


Fourthly, No Soldiers can
be quartered in the House of
any Freeman in time of Peace,
without his will; though they
pay for their quarters.


Fifthly, Every Freeman
hath such a full and absolute
propriety in Goods, that no
Taxes, Loans, or Benevolen∣ces
can be imposed upon them,
without their own consent by
their Representative in Parlia∣ment.
Moreover, They have
such an absolute Power, that
they can dispose of all they
have how they please, even
from their own Children, and


to them in what inequality they
will; without shewing any
cause: which other Nations
governed by the Civil Law, can∣not
do.


Sixthly, No Englishman
may be prest or compelled,
(unless bound by his Tenure)
to march forth of his Coun∣ty,
to serve as a Souldier in
the wars, except in case of a
Forreign. Enemy invading, or
a Rebellion at home. Nor may
he be sent out of the Realm
against his will upon any for∣reign
Employment, by way of
an honourable Banishment.


Seventhly, No Freeman
can be tried but by his Peers,
nor condemned but by the
Laws of the Land, or by an
Act of Parliament.



Eighthly, No Freeman may
be fined for any Crime, but
according to the merit of the
Offence, alwayes, 
salvo sib

contenemente suo,
 in such man∣ner
that he may continue and
go on in his Calling.


Briefly, If it be considered
only that they are subject to no
Laws but what they make
themselves, nor no Taxes but
what they impose themselves,
and pray the King and Lords to
consent unto, their Liberties
and Properties must be ac∣knowledged
to be transcendent,
and their worldly condition
most happy and blessed; and
so far above that of the sub∣jects
of any of our Neighbour
Nations, that as all the Wo∣men
of 
Europe
 would run into

England
 (the Paradise of Wo∣men)


if there were a Bridge
made over the Sea: so all the
Men too, if there were but an
Act for a general Naturalizati-of
all Aliens.






Of the Women, Chil∣dren,
and Servants
of England.


TOuching the Women of

England
 there are divers
things considerable in the En∣glish
Laws and Customs, Wo∣men
in 
England
 with all their
Moveable Goods, so soon as
they are married, are wholly in

potestate viri,
 at the will and
disposition of the Husband.



If any Goods or Chattels be
given to Feme Covert to a
Married Woman, they all im∣mediately
become her Hus∣bands.
She cannot let, set,
sell, give away, or alienate a∣ny
thing, without her Hus∣bands
consent.


Her very Necessary Apparel
by the Law is not hers in pro∣perty.
If she hath any Tenure
at all, it is 
in Capite,
 that is,
she holds it of and by her Hus∣band,
who is 
Caput mulieris;

and therefore the Law saith 
Ux∣or
fulget radiis mariti.


All the Chattels personal
the Wife had at the Marriage,
is so much her Husbands, that
after his death they shall not re∣turn
to the Wife, but go to the
Executor or Administrator of
the Husband, as his other


Goods and Chattels, except
only her 
Parapherna,
 which are
her Necessary Apparel, which
with the consent of her Hus∣band
she may devise by Will;
not otherwise by our Law; be∣cause
the property and possessi∣on
even of the 
Parapherna
 are
in him.


The Wife can make no Con∣tract
without her Husbands
consent, and in Law matters

sine viro respondere non potest.


The Law of 
England
 suppo∣seth
a Wife to be in so much
Subjection and Obedience to
her Husband, as to have no
will at all of her own: Where∣fore
if a Man and his Wife com∣mit
a felony together, the
Wife by the Law can be nei∣ther
Principal nor Accessory,
the Law supposing that in re∣gard


of the subjection and obe∣dience
she owes to her Hus∣band,
she was necessitated
thereunto.


The Law of 
England
 suppo∣ses
in the Husband a power o∣ver
his Wife, as over his Child
or Servant, to correct her
when she offends; and there∣fore
he must answer for his
Wives faults, if she wrong a∣nother
by her Tongue or by
Trespass, he must make satis∣faction.


So the Law makes it as high a
Crime, and allots the same pu∣nishment
to a Woman that
shall kill her Husband, as to a
Woman that shall kill her Fa∣ther
or Master, and that is
Petty Treason, and to be burnt
alive.



So that a Wife in 
England
 is

de jure
 but the best of Servants,
having nothing her own in a
more proper sense than a Child
hath, whom his Father suffers
to call many things his own, yet
can dispose of nothing.


The Woman upon Marriage
loseth not onely the power o∣ver
her person and her will, and
the property of her Goods, but
her very Name; for ever after
she useth her Husbands Sur∣name,
and her own is wholly
laid aside; which is not obser∣ved
in 
France
 and other Coun∣tries,
where the Wife sub∣scribes
her self by her Paternal
Name; as if 
Susanna
 the
Daughter of 
R. Clifford
 be
married to 
E. Chamberlayn,
 she
writes her self 
Susanna Clifford
Chamberlayn.



Notwithstanding all which,
their condition 
de facto
 is the
best in the World; for such is
the good nature of Englishmen
towards their Wives, such is
their tenderness and respect,
giving them the uppermost
place at Table and elsewhere,
the right hand every where, and
putting them upon no drudge∣ry
and hardship; that if there
were a 
Bridge
 over into 
Eng∣land

as aforesaid, it is thought
all the Women in 
Europe
 would
run thither.


Besides in some things the
Laws of 
England
 are above o∣ther
Nations so favourable to
that Sex, as if the Women
had voted at the making of
them.


If a Wife bring forth a
Child during her Husbands ab∣sence,


though it be for some
years within 
England,
 and not
beyond the Seas, that Husband
must father that Child.


If a Wife bring forth a Child
begotten by any other before
Marriage, yet the present Hus∣band
must own the Child, and
that Child shall be his Heir at
Law.


The Wife after her Hus∣bands
death may challenge the
third part of his yearly Rents
of Lands during her life, and
within the City of 
London
 a
third part of all her Husbands
moveables for ever.


As the Wife doth partici∣pate
of her Husband Name,
so likewise of his Condition.
If he be a Duke, she is a Dutch∣ess;
if he be a night, she is
a Lady; if he be an Alien made


a Denison, she is 
ipso facto
 so
too. If a Freeman marry a
Bondwoman, she is also free
during the Coverture; where∣fore
it is said as before, 
Uocor
fulget radiis Mariti.


All Women in 
England
 are
comprised under Noble or Ig∣noble.


Noble Women are so three
manner of wayes, 
viz.
 by Cre∣ation,
by Descent, and by Mar∣riage.


The King the Fountain of
Honour, may, and oft hath crea∣ted
Women to be Baronesses,
Countesses, Dutchesses, 
&c.


By Descent such Women are
Noble, to whom Lands holden
by such Dignity do descend a

Heir; for Dignities and Titles
of Honour for want of Males
descend to Females; but to


one of them onely, because
they are things in their own na∣ture
entire, and not to be di∣vided
amongst many (as the
Lands and Tenements are
which descend to all the
Daughters equally) besides by
dividing Dignities, the Repu∣tation
of 
Honour
 would be
lost, and the Strength of the

Realm
 impaired; for the 
Ho∣nour

and 
Chevalry
 of the 
Realm

doth chiefly consist in the 
No∣bility

thereof.


By Marriage all Women are
Noble, who take to their Hus∣bands
any Baron or Peer of the

Realm;
 but if afterwards they

 to Men not Noble, they

 their former Dignity, and
follow the condition of their la∣

Husband; for 
eodem modo
distolvitur earum Nobilitas, quo


constituitur.
 But Women No∣ble
by Creation, or Descent,
or Birthright, remain Noble,
though they marry Husbands
under their Degree; for such
Nobility is accounted 
Character
indelebilis.
 Here note, that by
the Courtesie of 
England
 a
Woman Noble only by Mar∣riage
alwayes retaineth her
Nobility; but if the Kings
Daughter marry a Duke or an
Earl, 
illa semper dicitur Rega∣lis,

as well by Law as Cour∣tesie.


Noble women in the Eye of
the Law are as Peers of the
Realm, and are to be tried by
their Peers, and to enjoy most
other Priviledges, Honour, and
Respect as their Husbands▪
Only they cannot by the opini∣on
of some great Lawyers


maintain an Action upon the
Statute 
De Scandalo Magnatum,

the Makers of that Statute
meaning only to provide in that
Case for the Great Men, and not
for the Women, as the words
of that Statute seem to import.
Likewise if any of the Kings
Servants within his Check Roll
should conspice the death of
any Noblewoman, this were
not Felony, as it is, if like
Conspiracy be against a Noble∣man.


None of the Wives Digni∣ties
can come by Marriage to
their Husbands, although all
their Goods and Chattels do;
onely the Wives Lands are to
descend to her next Heir: yet
is the Courtesie of 
England

such, that as the Wife for her
Dower hath the third part of


her Husbands Lands during her
life; so the Husband (for the
Dignity of his Sex, and for
playing the Man in begetting
his Wife with Child, which
must appear by being born a∣live)
shall have all his Wives
Lands (for his Dower, if it
may be so called) during his
life.


By the Constitutions of 
Eng∣land

married persons are so fast
joyned, that they may not be
wholly separated by any agree∣ment
between themselves, but
only by Sentence of the Judge,
and such separation is either 
a
Vinculo Matrimonii,
 and that
is 
ob praecontractum, vel ob
contractum per metum effectum,
vel ob frigiditatem, vel ob affi∣nitatem
sive Censanguinitatem,
vel ob Saevitiam;
 or else such


separation is 
a Mensa & Thoro,

and that is 
ob Adulterium.


The Wife in 
England
 is ac∣counted
so much one with her
Husband, that she caunot be
produced as a witness for or a∣gainst
her Husband.






Concerning Children in
England.


The Condition of Children
in 
England,
 is different from
those in our Neighbour Coun∣tries.


As Husbands have a more
absolute Authority over their
Wives and their Estates, so
Fathers have a more absolute
Authority over their Children.
Fathers may give all their E∣states
from their own Children,


and all to any one Child, and
none to the rest; the conside∣ration
whereof keeps the Chil∣dren
in great awe.


Children by the Common
Law of 
England
 are at certain
ages enabled to perform cer∣tain
Acts.


A Son at the age of 14 may
choose his Guardian, may claim
his Lands holden in 
Socage,
 may
consent to Marriage, may by
Will dispose of Goods and
Chattels.


At the age of 15 he ought
to be sworn to his Allegeance
to the King.


At 21 he is said to be of full
age, may then make any Con∣tracts,
may pass not only
Goods but Lands by Will,
which in other Countries may
not be done till the 
Annus con∣sistentiae,



the age of 25, when
the heat of youth is somewhat
abated, and they begin to be
staied in mind as well as in
growth.


A Daughter at 7 years is to
have aid of her Fathers Tenants
to marry her, for at those years
she may consent to Marriage,
though she may afterwards dis∣sent.


At 9 she is dowable, as if
then or soon after she could 
vi∣rum
sustinere,
 and thereby 
Do∣tem
promereri.


At 12 she is enabled to rati∣fie
and confirm her former con∣sent
given to Matrimony, and
if at that age she dissent not, she
is bound for ever; she may then
make a Will of Goods and
Chattels.



At 14 she may receive her
Lands into her own hands, and
is then out of Wardship, if she
be 14 at the death of her An∣cestor.


At 16 (though at the death of
her Ancestor she was under 14)
she shall be out of Wardship;
because then she may take a
Husband who may be able to
perform Knights-service as well
as hers.


At 21 she is enabled to con∣tract
or alienate her Lands by
Will or otherwise.


The Eldest Son inherits all
Lands, and to the younger
Children are disposed Goods
and Chattels, and commonly
the Eldest Sons Wives Portion;
and besides they are carefully e∣ducated
in some Profession or
Trade▪



If there be no Son, the Lands
as well as Goods are equally di∣vided
amongst the Daughters.






Concerning Servants in
England.


The Condition of Servants
in 
England
 is much more favou∣rable
than it was in our Ance∣stors
dayes, when it was so bad,
that 
England
 was called the
Purgatory of Servants, as it
was and is still the Paradise of
Wives, and the Hell for Horses.


Ordinary Servants are hired
commonly for one year, at the
end whereof they may be free
(giving warning 3 Moneths be∣fore)
and may place themselves
with other Masters; only it is
accounted discourteous and un∣friendly
to take another Mans


Servant, before leave given
by his former Master; and in∣discreet
to take a Servant with∣out
a Certificate of his diligence
and of his faithfulness in his Ser∣vice
to his former Master.


All Servants are subject to be
corrected by their Masters and
Mistresses, and resistance in a
Servant is punisht with severe
penalty; but for a Servant to
take away the life of his or her
Master or Mistris, is accounted
a Crime next to High Treason,
and called Petty Treason, and
hath a peculiar Punishment Ca∣pital.


Slaves in 
England
 are none
since Christianity prevailed. A
Slave brought into 
England,
 is
upon landing 
ipso facto
 free from
Slavery, but not from ordinary
service.



Some Lands in 
England
 are
holden in Villanage, to do
some particular Services to the
Lord of the Mannor, and such
Tenants may be called the
Lords Servants.


There is a Twofold Tenure
called Villanage, one where
the Tenure only is servile, as to
plow the Lords ground, sow,
reap, and bring home his Corn,
dung his Land, 
&c.
 the other
whereby both Person and Te∣nure
is servile, and bound in all
respects at the disposition of the
Lord; such persons are called
in Law pure Villans, and are
to do all Villanous Services to
improve the Land he holds to
the Lords use, themselves to
be wholly at the Lords Service,
and whatever they get is for
their Lord; of such there are


now but few left in 
England.

The nearest to this condition
are Apprentices (that signifies

Learuers
) a sort of Servants
that carry the Marks of pure
Villans or Bond-slaves (as be∣fore
in the Chapter of Gentry
is intimated) differing however
in this, that Apprentices are
Slaves only for a time and by
Covenant; the other are so at
the Will of their Masters.
