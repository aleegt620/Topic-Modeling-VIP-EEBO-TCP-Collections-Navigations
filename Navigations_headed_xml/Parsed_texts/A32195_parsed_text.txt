Hauing beene often sollicited by the Consuls of the seuerall Factories in Tur
y, & by other priuate merchants my esteemed friends, for true coppies of the Capitulations, vvee haue vvith the Grand Sig. as they vvere last renevved, & enlarged vvith aduantagious additions, & priuiledges by his Excellencie the Earle of vvinchilsea Our present Lord Ambassadour; I apprehen∣ded that printing some coppies thereof, vvould excuse mee from a greater paines, then transcribing so many vvould bee, as might satisfy my friends, & vvould serue for a good light, & information to euery member concerned in the Leuant trade, of the true extent of the articles vvee hold vvith the Turkish Empire, that so they may neither omit to take those aduantages in their trade, vvhich Our Capitulations allovv, nor ignorantly con∣fiding to vvhat vvas neuer granted, & agreed, runne into those errours, vvhich your com̄on purse hath so often been forced to rectify, & repaire.


These Capitulations, or articles of peace first opened our traffick vvith the Turkes in the Reign of Queene Elizabeth, about 80 yeares past, & since haue beene explained, & enlarged in the time of allmost euery Ambassadour vvith such alterations, as the state of affaires, & the abuses, & iniquitie of the times suggested: And yet all the uigilance, & caution of the many vvise, & resolute Mi∣nisters,

 that haue acted in his Embasse, could neuer (nor neuer vvill) bee able to prouide those prudent remedies, that may bee proofe, & a guard impregnable against the pretences, & uiolence o
 the Turkish auarice. The present 
mbassadour, my most estee∣med Lord (vvhom I haue the honour to serue as Secretary of his ovv
, & the af
aires of your Right VVorshipfull societie) hath contributed an affectuall addition to this vvorke, vvhich by a
uice, & information from all the Factories in Turky of their respectiue agreiuances, is as amply co
firmed, as the hand, & authoritie of the Emperour, & lavv of nations can establish: to vvhich proposalls tendered by the merc
ants, the vvarre then hot vvith Algier, occasioned his Excellencie to insert o
her cau∣tions, against the pyracies of Barbarie, vvhen at Adrianople hee encountred the messengers, that broug
 complaints of the assault his Maies
ies Fleet against the Capi
latio
, & Articles of peace had made upon the Gra
d Signors to vv
e of Algier, to vvhich al∣legations, his 
xcellencie made those prudent rep
ies, that neither the priuiledge of their Sect, nor their late presents, nor relation as subiects, could prevaile to afford them matter of fauour, or counten
nce: And at hovv easy, & cheap a rate your threa
ned es
ates vvere then protected, the accounts sen
 you home vvill iustify: & the inconsiderable Auances that haue happened since his arriuall, are a testimonie of the great vvisdome, & care of his Excellency; That if it please God, to con inue the same successe to him, in the remainde
 of his time, bles
ed vvith the present flo
rishing estate of your trade, his returne may bee celebrated vvi
h the same, & glory of the most happy, & fortunate of Embassadours.


These Capitulations being thus compleated, to vvhich nothing can at present, bee thought or, to make more, perfect, 
or no oppress
on imaginable, vvhich 
eet
 not a prohibition herein, untill the ma
itious inuention of the Turkes (vvhich is ingenious in nothing but in matters of their intere
) espy some unarmed part, in vvhich to vv
rd Vs: It is the vvi
dome, 
igilance, & reso u
ion of the Embas adour to maintaine them in reuerence, & obseruation: in vvhich that course, & method is to bee taken, as is not practised in the Courts of Christendome, & is of that different forme, in matte
 & proceeding, as vvill render an experi∣enced Minister in the treaties of other countries a Nouice in this, untill ti
e & conuersa
ion hath instructed him in a nevv science & unacq
inted Maximes of State, & policie.


The Capitulations the Grand Sig.
r
 giues to us, & other Christians tha
 t
ff ck vvith 
im, are (in my opinion) of an other nature & forme, then articles of peace are usuall to bee betvveene tvvo

 nations; for hee requires no counterpart from his Maiestie, vvhe∣reby to oblige him to performe the 
ame conditions vvith him∣self, but as if hee needed, & expected nothing from the English conferres on them seuerall Imperiall im̄unities, & priuiledges, as his Charter, & Acts of grace, vvithout demand of any returnes vvhich hee accounts as a diminution to his all containing Maiesty to bee needfull, or vvanting of. And this p
ide, is 
o naturall to the Turkes, & so necessary to bee flattered by those, vvho vvould maintaine the intercourse of peace, & trafficke vvi h them, that it is no meane Art to knovv vv
ll, how to nourish, & d
lly vvi
h their barbarous humour. But it is beyond, I must confesse, my capacitie, to bee more, then superficially acquainted vvith these mysteries, it is for my Lord, to bee Master, & profoundly uersed in them; vvho knovves the times, both to threaten, & to flatter, & vvhen vvith resolute vvords, or soft speeches to dispearse, & calme those stormes, vvhich vvee vvho liue, under the arbitrary vvill of Tyrants, doe often foresee, & yet dissolue, before the fury reach, & arriue you. This is the care, & study of his Excel∣lencie, vvho hath many times occasion to bee more tender of your safetie, then his ovvne, & to interpose himself, & his, betvveene you, & the barbarous rage. And vvhen I, vvho am one of the meanest of those concerned in your interest, 
an bee of seruice, & 
se to the publick benefit of the Right vvors∣hipfull societie, I shall thinke my life too meane a sacrifice to o
fer to you; for hauing receiued so many obligations from your vvorships & testimonies of your bountie, I iudge my self for euer bound to subscribe my self.

COVRTEOVS READER


If in perusing these follovving Capitulations you find some fevv letters misplaced, or the letter VV not so neatly formed, as vvere to bee vvished, attribute the fault neither to the Printer, nor Correctour: for the presse at Constantinople being but sildo∣me employed, is not furnished vvith the uarietie of those letters, vvhich are only propper to northern languages, amongst vvhich the VV is of speciall use; to supply vvhich defect, I haue beene forced to imitate that letter as vvell as I could beyond my ovvne art, & profession. And if any other letters are let slip, it vvas in time of the Correctours urgent auocation to other employments vvhich permitted him not to bee so accurate, & attentiue here∣unto as hee desired. And so hoping you vvill pardon, vvhat slight errours you may possibly meet vvith herein I remaine.

After vvhich there being arriued an other Ambassadour at this HighPort sent from the king of

s; As in times past, in the dayes of one of our forefathers of famous memorie Sultan Soliman Han, there vvas gran

And vvhilest in all Scales, & Ports in these parts they had refuge to the banner, & protection of the English Consuls It seemeth, that the French Ambassadour by some meanes hauing a nevv gotten into their Capitulations, that the said merchant strangers should come under their banner, did endeauour to force them in all Scales to their protection; for vvhich cause the controuersie vvas againe renevved & referred to our Diuan, or Great Councell vvhich after a due examination & a nevv election permited to the vvill, & choice of the said merchants, they againe did desire to bee under the protection of the Ambassadour of the King of England, notvvithstanding it being made knovvne to the Imperiall Port that as yet the french Embassadour did not desire to molest the said merchants, nor to force them under his protection, the first Article vvritten in the french Capitulations, that the merchants strangers should come under their protection, vvas by the Imperiall com̄and made Void & annulled; And to the end that according to the antient custo∣me of the said merchant strangers they should allvvayes come under the banner, & protection of the Ambassadour, or Consuls of England; & that neuer, hereafter they should bee uexed, or tro∣ubled by the french Embassadour in this point The said Embassa∣dours of his Maiestie of England hauing desired that this parti∣cular should bee vvritten, & enrouled in this nevv Imperiall Ca∣pitulationj this present article vvas accordingly inserted, & by the Imperiall authoritie It is com̄anded, That for euer in time to come, merchants of the said Princes, in the mentioned forme, & according to this Imperiall com̄and in their hand, shall allvvayes bee under the banner, & protection of the Embassadour, & Consuls of England.

There shall neuer bee permitted, or granted any Imperiall co∣m̄ands, contrary to the tenour, & articles of this Imperiall co∣m̄and, or Capitulations, nor in preiudice of this our peace & amitie, but in such occasion the cause shall first bee certifyed to the Ambassadour of England residing at the Port, to the end, that bee may ansvver, & obiect any scandalous action or other pretence, vvhich might infringe the peace, & league.






XXXV


The English merchants of all the merchandize, vvhich they shall bring, or transport in their ships hauing paid the custome, they shall also pay the right of Consulage to the English Ambassa∣dour, or Consul.








XXXVI


The Eng
ish merchants, & all under their banner, s
all & may safely throughout our dominion, trade, buy, sell, (except only com̄odities prohibited) all sorts of merchandize; likevvise either by land, or sea, they may goe, & traffick, or by the vvay of the riuer Tanais in Moscouia or by Ru

, vvithout the impediment, or molestation of any of our ministers, & they shall pay the custome & other duties of that country, & nothing more.






XXXVII


The English merchants, & all under their banner shall & may safely, & freely trade, & negotiate in Aleppo, Cairo, Scio, Smirna & in all parts of our dominions, & according to our antient custo∣mes of all their merchandize, they shall pay three in the hund∣red for custome, & nothing more.






XXXVIII


The English ships vvhich shall come to this our city of Constanti∣nople if by fortune of seas, or ill vveather, they shall bee forced to Co f
, or to such like Port; as long as the English vvill not unla

n any custome at arriuall at any Port, & hauing landed their 
er∣chandize, & paid their customes, & other duties, they may quietly & safely depart vvith out the mole
tation of any man.






XXXX


In regard English ships coming into our dominions, doe use often times to touch in some part of Africa, & there take in Pilgrims, & Mahometan passengers to transport them to Alexan∣dria, & arriuing at that Port, It seemeth that the Customers, & other officers, doe prete
d to take custome of all goo
s, vvhich are found in t
eir ships before the merchants are vvillin
 to la
d any; by occasion of vvhich molestation they haue forbo
e to

 transport any pilgrims. And in like manner, their ships vvhich come to Constantinople & carry diuerse merchandize, to tran∣sport part thereof to other places, the customers, & Farmours vvould enforce to land, & pretend to take custome thereof. VVherefore vvee doe com̄and, that all the English ships vvhich vvith their merchandize shall come into this Port of Constanti∣nople, Alexand
ia, Tripoli of Suria, Scanderoone, or into any 
ort vvhatsoeuer of our Empire according to use, they shall pay only custome of such goods, vvhich vvith their ovvne vvill they shall designe to sell, & such other merchandize, as they dis∣charge not from their ships vvillingly our customer shall not demand, nor take custome, nor other duties, but they may tran∣sport them vvhether soeuer they please.

And if it shall happen, That any of the said English Nation, or any under their banner shall com̄it man slaughter, bloudshed, or any other like offence; or that there shall happen any cause appertaining to the lavv, or Iustice, untill the Embassadour or Consul shall bee present, to examine the cause, the Iudges, nor other ministers, shall not decide nor giue any sentence, but such controuersie shall allvvayes bee declared in the presence of the Embassadour, or Consul to the end, that no man bee Iudged, or condemned contrary to the lavv, & the capitulations.






XXXXII


VVhereas it is vvritten, in the Imperiall Capitulations, that the goods landed out of any English ship, vvhich shall come into our dominions, & pay custome ought also to pay the dutie of Consulage, to the English Embassadour, or Consul. it seemeth That diuerse Mabometan merchants, Sciots, & other merchants in peace, & amitie vvith this Imperiall Port, & other merchant strangers doe deny, & refuse to pay the right of consulage. VVherefore, It is com̄anded, that all the merchandize vvhich shall bee laden upon their ships, & haue paid custome bee they goods of vvhomsoeuer, according to antient Imperiall Capitula∣tions, they shall pay the right of Consulage to the Embassadour or Consul of England vvithout any contradiction.






XXXXIII


That English merchants vvhich trade at Aleppo, & those under their banner of all the silke vvhich they shall buy, & lade upon their ships, shall pay the custome, & other duties, as the french, & Venetian merchants doe pay, & not one asper, or farthing more.

As the Embassadours of the King of England vvhich shall bee Resident in this Imperiall Court are the Representatiues, & Comissioners of the person of his Maiestie so the Interpreters are

 to bee esteemed the Com̄issioners of the Embassadour, Therefore for such matter as the Interpreters shall translate or speake in the name, or by the order of the Ambassadour; it being found that that vvhich they haue translated, to bee according to the vvill, & order of the Embassadour, or Consul, they shall bee all∣vvayes free, from any imputation, or punishment. And in case they shall com̄it any offence, our ministers shall not put any of the said Interpreters in prison, nor beat them vvithout knovv∣ledge of the Ambassadour, or Consul; in case any of the English Interpreters shall die, if hee bee an Englishman, all his goods, or faculties shall bee possessed by the Ambassadour, or Consul of England, but if bee shall bee a subiect of our dominion, they shall bee consigned to his next heire, & hauing no heire, they shall bee taken into our Exchequor. And as in this particular so also in all other the aboue mentioned articles, & priuiledges granted by our forefathers of happy memorie, It is expressely com̄anded & Ordained, That all our slaues shall euer obey, & obserue this Imperiall Capitulation & that the peace, & amitie shall bee res∣pected & maintained, vvithout any uiolation vvhatsoeuer.

Since vvhich time of our fore fathers of famous memorie, & the gran
 of these aboue mentioned Capitulations, articles, & estab∣lishment of peace, & amitie, the said King of England hauing in the time of our grand father of happy memorie Sultan Mahomet Han sent one, his vvell desired Ambassadour a person of qualitie to this high Port, to confirme this peace, articles & Capitula∣tions vvhich Embassadour did declare, that often times there vvere to diuerse persons Imperiall com̄ands granted, subrepti∣tiously procured contrary to the tenour, & articles of the Impe∣riall capitulations; vvhich being vvithout our knovvledge pre∣sented to our Iudges, and Gouernours, & the da

To the end therefore, that for the time to come, such commands shall not bee accepted of any, but that the imperiall Capitulations might bee allvvayes obserued, & maintained, according to the sincere meaning; the said Ambassadour demonstrating the sinceritie of his Maiestie & his request herein to our Imperiall knovvledge, vvhich vvas most acceptable; in conformitie thereuto it vvas ex∣pressely ordered; That all such com̄ands vvhich allready haue beene, or shall hereafter bee granted, vvhich are, or shal bee repugnant to the tenour of this Imperiall Capitulation, vvhat∣soeuer such commands sh

 Capitulations shall bee obserued; And vvhosoeuer shall present such com̄and contrary to the Capitulations, they shall bee taken from him, & in no vvise bee of any force, or ualiditie. In vvhich time also on the part of our said Grand father all the aboue vvrit∣ten Priuiledges, Articles, & Capitulations, vvere accepted, & rati∣fyed, & the peace, amitie, & good correspondence antiently con∣tracted vvas a nevv of him confirmed & established.

In the time of the inauguration of Sultan OSMAN Han in the Imperiall, & high throne, the King of England did againe send a famous, & noble Geentleman, his Embassadour, vvith letters, & presents vvhich vvere most acceptable. And the said Ambassadour desiring in the name of his King, & Lord, that the antient Capitulation, articles, & contracts granted in the dayes of our forefathers should bee of him renevved, & confirmed, & the antient peace, & amitie, anevv fortifyed, & established, vvhich his request vvas to the said Sultan Osman most acceptable. And the antient Capitulations, articles, Priuiledges, herein vvritten, & confirmed, & the long since contracted peace, & amitie by him promised, & accepted.

Being informed that in our dominions many of our Customers, & other officers in Aleppo contrary to the Imperial Capitulations under colour of taking custome, & rest upon silke of the English merchants, haue uiolently taken from the said merchants agreat sum of mony. And vvhereas in the Imperiall Capitulations, it is vvritten that for silke vvhich the English shall buy in Aleppo, they shall pay as the french, & Venetian merchants doe, & no more; Notvvithstanding the said customers, besides the tvvo & half per cent for custome & Rest haue taken from that nation

 is

 that

 in all the differences, & suites vvith the English Nation our Ma∣gistrates are not to heare nor decide the cause, unlesse their Em∣bas

Also vvhereas in the Imperiall Capitulations, it is ordered, that the Customers shall not take any custome for such gold, & dol∣lars as by the English Nation shall bee brought in, or carried out of Our Imperiall Dominions, & that the merchants are to giue only three percent, for the custome of t

end to take custome for their 
equeens, & dollars; & to take more custome then their due for their ravv silkes, vvhich they buy, & of the goods vvhich they land at Scanderoone to carry up to Aleppo, they demand six per cento; vvhich uniust exactions haue beene heretofore rectifyed, & redressed vvith an expresse Hatte sheriffe. But being novv againe informed, that the said 
nglish merchants, are as before vvronged, by reason that the Customers doe ualue, & estimate the goods of the English merchants more then they are vvor
h; & though the Customers are to haue bu
 three percent yet by an ouer ualuation of the goods they take from them six per cent. And the seruants of the Custome house under pretence of small duties, and expences vvrongfully take great sum̄es of mo
y from them. And a greater number of vvaiters being put aboard the English ships, then heretofore haue beene used, the charges thereof are a great expence to the merchants, & masters of ships that sustaine it. To all vvhich, vvee being requested for a redresse, doe Com̄and, that vvhen the Customers doe set great ualues upon their goods, th merchant offering to them accor∣ding to the rate of three per cent in specie of the same goods, the Customers shall not refuse but accept the same. And being desired by the English Embassadour that the bone specifyed abuses, & iniustice should bee rectifyed vvee Doe Com̄and, that contrary to the Imperiall Capitulations the English merchants bee neither in the foregoing particulars, nor in any other manner troubled nor their priuiledges uniustly infringed.

That the gallies, & other uessells of the Imperiall Fleet departing the dominions of the Grand Signor, & meeting on the s
a vvith the ships of England, they shall in no vvise giue them mo∣lestation, nor detaine them in their uoyage, nor take from them any thing vvhatsoeuer, but ought a
lvvayes to shovv to one & other good friendship, vvithout doing the least damage,. And it being thus dec ared in the Imperiall Capitulations, the B
yes and Captaines, vvho saile upon the Seas, & those of Algier, T
 is, & Tripoli meeting English ships vvhich saile from one Port to an other ought not

And contrary to the Articles of the Imperiall Capitulations, the goods of the English Nation ought to receiue no molestation
