A IOURNAL
of a late Voyage of

M
r
. de Gennes

To the Straits of
MAGELLAN
By le S
r
. Froger














TO THE
Right Honourable
THE
Lord 
Phelippeaux,

Count of 
Maurepas,
 Secre∣tary
of State, Superinten∣dant-General
of Maritime
Affairs, 
&c.


My Lord,


THE glorious Post You are
in possession of, and where∣unto
the judicious Choice of the
Greatest and Wisest of Kings,
as well as a most ripen'd Capaci∣ty,
hath advanced▪ You to, doth


so naturally appropriate this Rela∣tion
unto Your Self, that I cou'd
not forbear, how shapeless soever
the same may be, to present it to
Your Honour: I had no other
Design in the first Undertaking,
than to compile it for my own
particular Instruction: But the Si∣lence
of all those who made the
Voyage with me, constrained me
to expose it to publick View.
Your Lordship can find nothing
here, which the Extent of Your
Knowledge hath not already anti∣cipated;
for what can such a Mini∣ster
be ignorant of, who for the
Revolution of so many Years, and
in such hazardous Times, hath su∣stain'd
the Weight of Publick Af∣fairs
in the most potent Monarchy
of the World, and whose Extra∣ction
is from a Family wherein
Science and Illustrious Qualities are
as Hereditary as Nobleness of Birth,


and Integrity of Life? Wherefore,

My Lord,
 I have been so far from
thinking to offer any thing New
to Your Honour upon this Occasi∣on,
that I have had no no other
Intention, than barely to make
known the ardent Desire I have to
be in a Condition to merit Your
Protection by a continual Applica∣tion
of my self to my Duty, and
an Inviolable Adherence to Your
Lordship's Will, who am with pro∣foundest
Respect,


My Lord,


Your most Humble, and
most Obedient Servant,
T. Froger.










THE
PREFACE.


AS I have always had a passionate
Desire to see Foreign Countries, I
was no sooner Master of my own Inclina∣tions,
but I made it my Business, in the
prosecution of my Design, to attain to what∣ever
might contribute to the Imploy∣ment
of an honest Man, and to distinguish
my self from those Travellers, who run
over the World for the sole delight they
have of seeing different Objects, without
ever putting themselves in a Condition
to be useful to their Country: Wherefore
being thus inclin'd, and assisted by the
Advice of my Friends, I took to the
Study of the 
Mathematicks,
 and at
length, by reading the Relations of others,
made my self familiarly acquainted with
the History of the different Nations of
the World.



The Noise which Monsieur 
de Gennes

his Expedition made in 1695, deter∣min'd
my Resolutions of taking that Op∣portunity
to go abroad, as believing I
could not do better than to lay hold of
the Conveniency of so brave a Voyage;
and therefore without any more ado, I
abandon'd the little Experience that an
Age of Nineteen Years cou'd supply me
with, to the Course of my Fortune, came
quickly to make use of the Lessons I had
learnt (as well as the chief Officers of
the Mariners) under one of the great∣est
Masters of the Age; and began now
to come to the practick Part of what I
knew before but in the Theory. The ge∣neral
Idea I had formed with my self
of the Voyage, and the frequent Con∣versations
I had with our Pilots, gave
me the Advantage of taking notice of
all the Circumstances I thought necessary
to Sailing; And I am not to omit,
that the long abode I have made in
divers Parts, giving me a real Taste
of the Pleasure there is in seeing Foreign
Countries; I have with all imaginable
Exactness enquir'd into the Commerce
of the Place, the particular Interests
of each Colony, the Strength, Situation,
and Advantages of the Ports; the Man∣ners,


Customs, and Religion of the Peo∣ple;
and lastly, the Nature of those
Fruits, Plants, Birds, Fishes, and the
Animals that seem'd to have any thing
extraordinary in or peculiar to them,
and these I have set out in the best
manner I cou'd, by a great many Cop∣per-Cuts,
all of them respectively fixed in
their proper Places.


But I have more particularly apply'd
my self to make Charts of the Entrances
of Harbours and Rivers, either of my
self, as I have had Leasure for it, as
may be seen in those I have given of

Gambia, Rio-Janeiro,
 and 
All-Saints
-Bay,
as by reforming the Charts or Me∣moirs
that have been taken of the Streight
of 
Magellan,
 of the disemboguings of the
Isles of 
Antilles,
 and of the Government
of 
Cayenne,
 that hath not yet appear'd
in the World, under the Name of 
Aequi∣noctial
France,
 in that Extent, and
with those Limits I have set it forth by.


I hope this Relation will meet with
so much the more favourable Reception,
seeing I have retrencht it of those te∣dious
Particulars wherewith others of this
kind are usually stuffed, and have made
use of all the Exactness and Simplicity
that a Work requires that has no other


than Truth for its End, and wherein
the Reader will have the pleasure either
of seeing new Descriptions, or his Judg∣ment
regulated in respect of those he has
already seen elsewhere; and lastly, an
orderly View given of all the unfortunate
Disappointments of so noble an Underta∣king,
that had been made, during the
War we were engag'd in, and of which
you have the Subject at large in 
p.
 80,
85, 
&c.
 and so onwards.












A
RELATION
OF A
VOYAGE
Made in the Years 1695, 1696,
1697. to the Coasts of 
Africa,

the Streights of 
Magellan, Brasil,


Cayana,
 and the 
Antilles
 or 
Caribby

Islands.


VVE set out from 
Rochel
 on
the 3d.
 of 
June, A. D.

1695. to navigate the
Southern Sea, with six
Vessels, 
viz.
 The 
English Falcon,
 furnish∣ed
with 46 Pieces of Cannon, and 260
Men, under the command of 
Monsieur
de Gennes
 Captain: The 
Sun of Africa,

carrying 32 Pieces, and 220 Men, com∣commanded


by M. 
du Pare,
 Captain of
the Light Frigat: The 
Seditious,
 a light
Frigat of 26 Guns, and 140 Men, 
M. de
la Roque
 Commander: The 
Corvette-Fe∣licity

of 8 Pieces of Ordnance, and 40
Men: The 
Glutton-Pink
 of 10 Guns, and
40 Men: And the 
Fruitful-Pink,
 of 4
Guns, and 20 Men: These two Pinks
carry'd two Mortars and 600 Bombs,
with all sorts of Provisions and Ammu∣nition
necessary for a long Voyage.


We set sail about three a-clock in the
Morning, with a fair North-East Wind,
pass'd the 
Pertuis
 or Straight of 
Antioch,

and before Noon, entirely lost the sight
of Land.


On the 7th. Instant at Eleven of the
Clock, we discover'd at the distance of
three or four Leagues under the Wind,
two Vessels, which the 
Felicity
 went to
view: They came from St. 
Domingo,

and were steering their Course for 
Ro∣chel.


On the 9th. we had sight of another
Vessel, which the 
Seditious
 and the 
Fe∣licity

gave chase to, during four Hours:
The latter, which came very near her,
inform'd us, that she seem'd to be a 
Sal∣ly-Man,

and might carry about 30 Pieces
of Cannon.



On the 10th. at Noon, we made 15
Leagues a-cross Cape 
Finisterre.


On the 11th. at Break of day, we
were separated from the 
Seditious,
 and
the 
Fruitful,
 as also from another Vessel,
which follow'd us from 
Rochel.


On the 15th. at four a-Clock in the
Afternoon, we espy'd a very large Ship,
which came up to view us within three
Cannon-shot, and afterward tack'd about
again; whereupon we gave her Chace,
till the darkness of the Night caus'd us
to lose the sight of her.


On the 21th. at Sun-Rising, we disco∣ver'd
the Island of 
Madera,
 from whence
we judg'd our selves to be distant about
20 Leagues.


On the 22th.
 at 11 a-clock at Night,
we lost the Shallop with Decks, which

M. de Gennes
 had caus'd to be built, on
purpose to throw out the Bombs: For as
she was tacking about, whilst the Sea
ran very high, her Cable broke, and she
was driven out of her Course.


On the 26th. at three a-clock in the
Morning, we pass'd the Tropick of 
Can∣cer;

at Break of day, we discover'd the
Land of 
Praya;
 and in the Afternoon
perform'd the Ceremonies of the 
Tropi∣cal
Baptism
 or Ducking, which are com∣monly


us'd by the Mariners in those
Places.


On the 1st. day of 
July,
 at three a-clock
in the Morning, the 
Corvette
 let
off a Gun, to give us notice that she
was near Land; whereupon we sail'd
beyond that Vessel without discerning
her, by reason that she was very low
built, and the Night was dark.


On the 3d. we discover'd 
Cape Verd,

or 
Green Head,
 and cast Anchor at 11
a-clock at Night, within two Leagues
of the Island of 
Gorea:
 The next Day
we likewise rode at Anchor within a
Cannon-shot of the Place.


The Governour of that Island imme∣diately
sent to compliment M. 
de Gennes,

with a Present of an Ox, and two Do∣zen
of Pullets. The Person who brought
this Present told us, That the Vessels of
the 
East-India
 Company pass'd by a lit∣tle
while ago, and that an 
English
 De∣serter
had inform'd them, That almost
the whole Garrison of 
Gambia
 was fall'n
sick, and wanted Provisions; which
piece of News was so well confirm'd to

M. de Gennes,
 even by the Relation of
the Governour himself; that if the 
Se∣ditious

and the 
Fruitful
 had come up
with us, we should have set sail the


very next day, in order to besiege the
Fort, before the 
English
 could have had
any notice of our Arrival.


In the mean while, waiting till those
Ships appear'd, we diverted our selves,
some in Hunting, and others in Fishing;
nay we met with sufficient variety of
Divertisements, not very expensive,
without leaving the Villages. The Ne∣groes
came continually on board with
their
 Vessels full of Fish, which they
gave us in exchange for Knives, Sheets
of Paper, little pieces of Iron, and o∣ther
Toys of the like nature: We also
pierc'd some Barrels of Wine, and set∣ting
aside the Heat of the Weather,
which was excessive, the Sports and Pa∣stimes
abated a great deal of the Impati∣ence
that we had to go to 
Gambia.


On the fifth Instant, 
M. de Gennes,

M. 
du Parc,
 and the Governour of 
Go∣rea,

went to give a Visit to the 
Alcaty

or Governour of a Village call'd 
The
Gap,
 situate on the Sea-shore, near a
small Marsh, being the only place where
fresh Water can be taken in; upon
which account the 
Alcaty
 suffers none
to do it, till an Agreement be made be∣forehand,
to give him a Bottle of Bran∣dy
for every Shallop. He receiv'd these


Gentlemen very courteously, and grant∣ed
their Requests upon good Terms.


The next Day M. 
de Gennes
 invited to
Dinner the Governour of 
Gorea,
 the a∣foresaid

Alcaty
 of 
Gap,
 and another 
Al∣caty

of a neighbouring Village, who
was the Brother of a Favourite of the
King of 
Houmel,
 and otherwise in great
esteem for his Magnanimity, and for
being one of the most robust and well-set
Men of the Country. The 
Alcaty

of 
Rufisca
 was also present, by chance,
with a Negro Lady, the Widow of a
certain 
Portuguese,
 who had one of
the chief Places in the Kingdom:
This Lady had excellent Features,
was endow'd with a generous Disposi∣tion,
and of a very obliging Deport∣ment;
being of a middle-siz'd Sta∣ture,
and cloath'd after the 
Portuguese

Fashion. M. 
du Gennes
 treated them all
magnificently, and made them some small
Presents: He was also desirous to divert
them with a Volly of Cannon and Mus∣ket-shot:
But Dinner was scarce ended,
when they earnestly importun'd to be
dismiss'd. The cause of their sudden
Departure being unknown to us, we
were not a little surpriz'd, in regard that
they had no reason to be tir'd with the


Company; till the Governour of 
Gorea

told us,
 That apparently they had oc∣casion
to ease themselves, and that a Su∣perstitious
Custom prevail'd among 'em,
never to do it at Sea.


On the 9th. Instant, our Shallop be∣ing
fitted out to take in fresh Water, a
Storm of Wind arose, which threw
her on the Coast: She suffer'd little
Dammage, by reason that the Shock
happen'd on the Sand: Nevertheless
this Accident was like to have occasi∣on'd
a great Contest with the Negroes,
who gave it out, That one Moiety of
the Vessels that run a-ground on their
Coasts, ought to be appropriated to
their Use: And even the Governour of

Gorea
 himself acknowledg'd, that they
had a Right to such a Claim: But for∣asmuch
as this Law was made only in
reference to Merchant-Ships, we speedi∣ly
set some of our Men on Shore, to
stand upon their Guard; and for far∣ther
Security, retain'd seven or eight
Negroes, who were come on board to
trade with Fish: In the mean while, our
Carpenters wrought during the whole
Night; and the next Day in the After∣noon
our Shallop return'd laden with
Water, and as sound as before.



On the 13th. at two a-clock, two Ves∣sels
appear'd, whilst our 
Corvette
 was
sailing to the Village of 
Rusisca;
 where∣upon
we discharg'd a Cannon to cause
her to return, and to recal all the Mariners
on board: We likewise made Signals to
the other Ships, which were answer'd
by them. They were the 
Seditious
 and
the 
Fruitful
 Pinks, which came to join
with us again, after having waited for
our Arrival eleven Days at 
Madera:

They cast Anchor at two a-clock, and
the next Day our 
Corvette
 set out a se∣cond
time for 
Rufisca,
 to get some Pro∣visions,
that were necessary for our de∣parture
in good earnest.


Before we leave 
Gorea,
 it may not be
improper to give some account, how
the 
French
 settled in that Island, and to
relate what I have seen and heard con∣cerning
the Nature of the Coast, and the
Traffick and Manners of the Inhabitants.


The Island of 
Gorea
 is distant only
one League from the Continent, four
from Cape 
Verd,
 and may be about
half a League in Compass. The 
Hol∣landers

first fix'd a Colony therein, and
built the Forts of St. 
Francis
 and St. 
Mi∣chael,

which are still to be seen: After∣ward
the Count 
d' Etrées
 made himself
Master of the Place 
A. D.
 1678: The



English
 took it from the 
French
 in 1692.
and demolish'd the Forts which were e∣rected
by the 
Hollanders:
 At last the

Senegal
 Company, having re-taken it in
1693, rebuilt St. 
Michael
's Fort: And
there are at present in this Island about
100 
Frenchmen,
 with some Families of

Lapto's
 or free Negro's, who are hir'd
by the Company to trade from one
Coast to another.


The Sea-Coast is flat, sandy, and in
many places very barren: The Soil
brings forth Millet, Rice, Tobacco, and
some Fruits, which are all generally ve∣ry
insipid: The Country is every where
beset with a sort of wild Apple or Crab-Trees,
that grow as thick as Broom in
a Heath or Warren: There are also cer∣tain
small Shrubs, which are very com∣mon;
their Fruit, call'd 
Mandanaza
 by
the Negro's, being no bigger than a
small Nut, exactly resembles an Apri∣cock
in Shape and Colour: It is of a
very grateful Taste, but very unwhol∣som:
Its Leaf is like that of Ivy, but
of a somewhat lighter Green. I have
seen there a sort of Trees not unlike
our Plum-Trees, the Fruit of which has
the Colour, Bigness, and almost Taste
of our Cherries; 'Tis call'd 
Cahoüar;



and I have caus'd the Figure of it to be
drawn, because it appear'd to me to be
very remarkable. The Negro's made a
Present to us, as a choice Banquet, of
certain large Fruits that resemble small
Gourds, but under the Skin, is only a
kind of Substance like dress'd Flax:
They cause them to be roasted under
Embers, and afterward chew them to
suck out the Juice, which is as yellow
as Saffron: This Fruit has a Stone as
large as an Egg, and as hard as Iron.
In the Country there is a great number
of Palm-Trees, out of which the Ne∣gro's
extract a sort of white Liquor,
that we call Palm-Wine, and which is
thus prepar'd: They make an Incision
in the Trunk, and apply to it a Gourd-Bottle,
into which the Liquor runs by
the means of a Pipe: 'Tis very pleasant
to drink when one is hot; but at the end
of two or three Days, it is spoil'd, and
easily inebriates.


The Island affords great variety of
Game: Turtle-Doves, 
Pintades,
 Pigeons
and Partridges as big as Pullets, and of
an exquisite Taste, are very numerous;
besides divers sorts of large Fowl, which
are unknown in 
Europe.
 There are also
Goats, Stags, Buffles, Apes, Civet-Cats,

A Storke of y
e
 Coaste
of Affrica.


M. Vander Gucht Scul:







Tygers, Elephants, Lions, flying Ser∣pents,
and many other Animals. A∣mong
others we met with two very
care Birds, 
viz.
 one as big as a Turkey,
with black Feathers, its Legs being thick
and short, and its Head of an extraordi∣nary
Figure, which will be better ex∣plain'd
by the annex'd Draught of it,
than by a large Description. The other
Bird is somewhat less, having white Fea∣thers
over the whole Body, the Bill long
and yellow, the Tail and the tip of the
Wings of a very lively Fire-Colour, and
the Legs small and very long.


The People of these Coasts from the
River 
Senegal,
 are entirely black, robust,
and well-set. They all go stark naked,
both Men and Women, except their
Privy Parts, that are cover'd with a
sort of Cotton-Stuff, which they call

Pagnes:
 They are very slothful, and al∣ways
hold a Pipe in their Mouth: They
feed upon nothing but Millet and Fish,
and very seldom eat any Flesh: They
were surpriz'd to see us eat Herbs, and
said that we were like Horses in that par∣ticular.
Their Trade consists in Slaves,
Gold, 
Morphil
 or Ivory, and Wax;
which Commodities they usually ex∣change
for Iron, Hatchets, Fusees, Co∣ral,


Glasses, Knives, Paper, red Stuffs,
and more especially Brandy; in which
they take so great delight, that the Son,
when 'tis in his power, often sells his Fa∣ther
to procure it.


Every Province has its particular Go∣vernour,
who gathers the Tributes due
to the King, and takes care to call an
Assembly of the Negroes when they are
enjoyn'd to go on Warfare. Their ordinary
Arms are the Hanger,
 the 
Sagay,
 which
is a very light Half-Pike, and the Bow,
which nevertheless they do not use ve∣ry
dexterously; some of them are also
furnish'd with Fire-Arms. Their princi∣pal
aim is to take a great number of
Prisoners, who are never exchang'd, but
are either distributed for the Service of
the Officers, or sold for the Soveraign's
Advantage. The King resides at the di∣stance
of thirty Leagues from the Sea-Coast
in a Town called 
Cayor,
 where he
has a Palace, and Appartments for his
Wives, always entertaining some Fo∣reigners
in his Court, and more especi∣ally
those of the 
Portuguese
 Nation:
His Dominions are extended very far in
the Country, and lie along the Coasts
from 
Rufisca,
 which is four Leagues di∣stant
from 
Gorea
 to the Southern side

of the 
Senegal:
 The Northern is inha∣bited
by certain 
Moors,
 who arrive there
in Caravans from the Deserts of 
Zaara,

and whose whole Trade consists in the
Gums, with which they load their Ca∣mels:
They likewise bring 
Barbary
 Hor∣ses,
with which the Negroes afterward
traffick even to the Confines of 
Guinée.

The King of 
Houmel
 keeps four or five
hundred for his Guard; and when he
has a mind to make War, he can raise
6000, all the People being obliged to
march, except the 
Marabous,
 who are
their Priests, and who stay at home
with their Wives, to make Prayers for
the good Success of the King's Arms.
These 
Marabous
 are very numerous, and
every one of them has divers Wives:
They pray to God five times a Day,
more especially at Midnight, and at the
Rising and Setting of the Sun; but be∣fore
they say their Prayers, they usual∣ly
wash their whole Body several Times:
Lastly, they write and speak the 
Ara∣bick

Tongue, as we do the 
Latin.


The most part of the Negroes are
destitute of Religion,
 and live in the
Woods, of the Booty that they get from
Travellers. Those who have any kind
of Belief, follow the 
Mahometan
 Sect,


very much corrupted: They wear a∣bout
their Neck, Arms, and Legs, and
even bind about their Horses, little Lea∣thern
Bags, which they call 
Grisgris,
 in
which are enclosed certain Passages of
the 
Alcoran,
 which were given by the

Marabous,
 to secure them from vene∣mous
Beasts, and from all sorts of
Wounds; an abominable Superstition,
which they equally observe in reference
to their manag'd War-Horses. They
circumcise their Children, but not till
they have attained to the Age of Twelve
or Thirteen Years. Their Sabbath is
kept on 
Monday,
 during which they for∣bear
working, and make but one Meal.
They have no considerable Festival but
that of 
Tabaské,
 which happens in the
Month of 
June;
 and for the celebration
of which, they prepare themselves a
Month before, by continual Fasting and
abstaining from correspondence with their
Wives: Then they meet together in a
large Plain, to say their Prayers, and to
be reconcil'd with their Enemies, eve∣ry
one bringing a Goat, a Calf, or some
other Animal of the like nature, which
the 
Marabous,
 cloath'd with a kind of
Surplice made of white 
Pagnes,
 or Cot∣ton-Stuff,
sacrifice to 
Mahomet.
 After



he celebration of the Festival, which
continues till Evening, every one car∣ries
away his Victim to make a solemn
Banquet of it, with his Family; which
Custom seems to have much relation to
the 
Jewish
 Passover.


When one of the principal Elders
dies,
 the 
Marabous
 embalm his Body,
and expose it to publick View in a Hut,
where the Women of the Neighbour∣hood
are assembled to lament his Death
during several Days. At last when these
Lamentations, which continue more or
less, according to the Quality of the de∣ceased
Person, are ended, the 
Marabous

wrap up the Corps in a 
Pagnes
 or Cot∣ton-Shrowd,
and bury it; whilst his in∣timate
Friends take a pride in stabbing
themselves, to shew the sincerity of their
Affection; which barbarous Custom they
blindly observe, even contrary to the
Prohibitions of their own Religion and
Laws. This is all that I have seen, or
could get Information of, concerning
those Coasts, with any manner of pro∣bability.


On the 19th. we set sail for the River
of 
Gambia,
 having for our Guides two
Negroes, and the 
English
 Deserter, of
whom we have already made mention.


We sail'd along the Coasts four or five
Leagues in length, and twenty the next
day. At 6 a-clock in the Evening we
cast Anchor within three Leagues and
a half of the Mouth of the River, and
immediately sent out our Shallops to
sound the depth of it, but they met
with a great deal of foul Weather du∣ring
the whole Night, and were not a∣ble
to return till the next Day at
Noon.


On the 22d. Instant, at eight a-clock
in the Morning, we all enter'd the Ri∣ver,
with 
English
 Colours, and at Ele∣ven
we saluted with three Cannon-shot,
a thick and very high Tree, which
serves instead of a Pavilion to the King
of 
Bar,
 and which the 
English
 are like∣wise
wont to salute, as often as they
come into, or go out of the River. At
Noon we ran a-ground before the Isle
of Dogs, on a Shelf of Mud, where we
stuck above two Hours, and could not
get off without some difficulty. At last
at Five a-clock in the Evening, we cast
Anchor within a small League of the
Fort, which we immediately invested,
with the 
Corvette
 and the Shallops, to
hinder the Importation of Provisions,
or of any manner of Succours. We


also began to unmast the 
Fruitful
 Pink,
to turn it into a Bomb-Galley.


The same Evening M. 
de Gennes
 sent
our two Negro Agents to a Village cal∣led

Gilofriée,
 situated on the River-side,
to carry a Letter to a certain ancient 
Por∣tuguese,

nam'd 
Don Cardos,
 whom the Go∣vernour
of 
Gorea
 had assur'd us to be
well-affected to the 
French.
 And in∣deed,
this 
Portuguese
 having receiv'd the
Letter, came to salute M. 
de Gennes,
 to
whom he afterwards gave an exact Ac∣count
of the Condition of the Fort,
and insinuated at the same time, that
forasmuch as the 
English
 were not well
belov'd by the King of 
Bar,
 it would
be no difficult matter, by the means of
some Present, to bring him over to
their Party. The Chevalier 
de Fontenay,

our second Captain, went at two a-clock
in the Morning, to compliment

Don Cardos,
 and to entreat him to per∣mit
us to land a Body of Men; to hin∣der
the 
English
 from taking in fresh Wa∣ter
and Provisions: But the King had
told him that he wou'd not be con∣cern'd
in our Quarrels, lest if we could
not take the Fort, it might give an oc∣casion
of Hatred to the 
English,
 who
might afterwards resent the Affront; and


that therefore he would not suffer any
one to land, but that he would readily
supply us with all Things that were in
his Power.


On the 23d.
 Instant M. 
de la Roque

went to summon the Fort to surrender,
and upon his Approach, a Canoo ap∣pear'd
to enquire of him what were
his Demands: He answer'd, That he
was desirous to speak with the Gover∣nour:
Whereupon he was conducted
blind-fold to the Governour's House,
and was receiv'd in his Absence by the
King's Lieutenant, whom he made ac∣quainted
with the occasion of our Arri∣val,
and that he was come to summon
the Place before we proceeded to any
Acts of Hostility. M. 
de la Roque
 was
nobly treated, and the Healths of the
Kings of 
England
 and 
France
 were drank
several times, with Volleys of Cannon-shot.
After the Collation, M. 
de la
Roque
 return'd on board, with three

English
 Officers, whom M. 
de Gennes
 en∣tertain'd
with the like Magnificence.
They desir'd some Days of Truce to
consult about the Affair, but no longer
time was granted to make their posi∣tive
Answer, than till six a-clock the
next Morning; so that they were re∣conducted


to their Fort very much dissa∣tisfy'd
with these Proceedings, and
wrote the following Letter to M. 
de
Gennes.




A Letter written by the English Offi∣cers
to M. de Gennes.


From St. James's Fort, 
July 23. 1695
.


SIR,


YOU have allow'd us so little time
to consider about your Summons, made
(as you say) by the Order of the 
French

King, that we are resolv'd to wait for
your Attacks, and to defend our selves to
the last Extremity, rather than to Sur∣render;
not doubting but to meet with a
generous Enemy. We are,


Sir, 
&c.




The next Night 23 or 24 of our
Shallops took a Brigantine and several
Canoos, laden with Provisions for the
Fort; whilst the 
Sun of Africa
 gave
Chace to another Canoo, in which the
Governour was passing over thither, who
perceiving their close Pursuit, threw


himself into the Sea, and made his E∣scape
to the Woods, from whence he
found means to retire the same Night,
without being discover'd.


At break of Day, we set out two of
our Shallops, and sail'd three Leagues
up a small River, which takes its Name
from the Village of 
Block,
 where a
certain Prince resides, who assumes the
Title of Emperor,
 and who is almost
continually engag'd in War against the
King of 
Bar.
 We burnt two small Ves∣sels,
which the 
English
 were refitting
there, and laded our Shallops with two
Pieces of Cannon, and divers cast Pate∣rero's
that were taken out of them. In
passing down the River, we landed at
the Village of 
Barifet,
 where a Petty
King keeps his Court, who is tributary
to the other of 
Block.
 This Prince
sent us word, That it was customary
for Strangers to make him some Pre∣sent,
and that he desir'd us to furnish him
with a Scarlet-Cloak: We contented him
with some Bottles of Brandy, which
were more acceptable to him than the
finest Cloak in the World.


On the 24th.
 Instant, at Eight a-clock
in the Morning, the 
Fruitful
 Pink dis∣charg'd
two Bombs, which did not come


near the Fort; therefore M. 
de Gennes

forbad the letting off any more, and de∣termin'd
to wait for the Tide of Flood,
in order to level the Shot within reach
of the Place. In the mean while, the
Governour having sent a Canoo with a
White Flag, to desire to Capitulate, two
Officers were detain'd as Hostages, and
M. 
de la Roque
 and the Chevalier 
de Fon∣tenay

were sent to the Fort, to draw
up the Articles, which were sign'd the
same Day, by all the 
English
 Officers,
and the next Day, by all the Captains
of the Squadron.

Sign'd



JOHN HAMBURY.


DE LA ROQUE.


The Chevalier
 DE FON∣TENAY.












On the 27th.
 at break of Day, M. 
de
la Perriere,
 Major of the Squadron▪
gave notice to the Governour to prepare
for his Departure, the Term which was
granted him being expir'd: At Six a-clock
the Shallops and Canoos ready fit∣ted
up, attended on the Commander,
and then cast Anchor in a Line, with∣in
Pistol-shot of the Fort. M. 
de Fon∣tenay,

who was chosen for Governour,


first came on Shore, where the 
English

Governour gave him the Keys, and em∣bark'd
the same time to go on board
the 
Felicity.
 Afterwards all the Forces
landed; Sentinels were set in all the ne∣cessary
Posts; the 
French
 Standard was
set up; 
Te Deum
 was sung by the Almo∣ners
of the Squadron, and 37 Cannons
were discharg'd.


This Fort was square,
 with four Ba∣stions,
lined with good Brick-Work, ha∣ving
in the Out-Works three pieces of
Fortification call'd 
Horse-Shooes,
 and se∣veral
Batteries along the Pallisado's: It
was furnished with a prodigious quantity
Arms, and the Magazines of Powder
were well stor'd; insomuch that 'tis cer∣tain
that if the Governour, being a
young Man, (who was more intent up∣on
his Pleasures than on the putting of
his Fort in a good Condition) had ta∣ken
care to keep therein a sufficient
quantity of Provisions and of fresh Wa∣ter,
it might have held out for a long
time. The Situation of this Fort was
very advantageous, and there wanted
only a Magazine of Powder, and a Ci∣stern
Bomb-proof, to render it impreg∣nable.



On the 28th. Instant M. 
de la Roque

went to desire the King of 
Bar
 to give
us leave to take possession of the Slaves
and Oxen, which the 
English
 had in his
Dominions: Whereupon the King re∣ply'd,
That the Fort being surrender'd,
every thing that was left on the Land▪
of very good right belonged to him:
M. 
de la Roque
 told him, that we would
not be so satisfy'd, and that if he re∣fus'd
to grant our Demands willingly,
we wou'd certainly do our selves Justice
by force of Arms. And indeed a Coun∣cil
was held about that Answer; and for∣asmuch
as it was well known, that in
the beginning of the War, he had seiz'd
on Merchandizes to the value of above
40000 Crowns, belonging to the 
French

who traded on that River; it was
determin'd to make a Descent upon the
Country, to take the King Prisoner, and
as many Negroes as cou'd be catched;
and to burn all their Hutts. This De∣cree
was ready to be put in execution,
when an 
Alcaty
 came to pass a Com∣pliment
upon M. 
de Gennes,
 and to as∣sure
him, that the King was unwilling
to engage in a War against him; on the
contrary, that he was very desirous
to keep an amicable Correspondence


with him; and that he might freely take
whatever he should think fit.


The next Day, M. 
de Gennes
 went to
give a Visit to the King; the principal
Officers walk'd before him to his Ca∣noo,
and conducted him to the Place
where the Interview was to be made.
The King appear'd a little while after,
without any regular Train, in the midst
of a great number of Negroes, and at∣tended
with some Drummers: He was
of a very advantageous Stature, and was
cloath'd with a red Doublet beset with
the Tails of Wild Beasts, and little Bells.
He had on his Head an Osier-Cap, a∣dorn'd
with divers Rows of Coral, and
two Ox-Horns. Here we may observe
by the way, that Circumcised Persons in
those Parts, have the liberty to wear
such a Cap, during eight Days imme∣diately
after their Circumcision, by ver∣tue
of which, they are authoriz'd to
commit all manner of Crimes imagina∣ble,
with impunity, and none durst com∣plain
of their outragious Villainies. The
King in this pompous Equipage, hold∣ing
a Pipe in his Mouth, walk'd with
a Majestick Gate under a stately Tree,
where he usually gives Audience to the
Ambassadors of the neighbouring Princes.


M. 
de Gennes
 went thither to salute him,
and made him a Present of 20 Bars of
Iron, a Barrel of Brandy, a Pair of Pi∣stols,
and a Burning-Glass, with the Ef∣fects
of which he was extremely sur∣priz'd.
The Interpreter being a 
French∣man

who dwelt on the River above ten
Years, spoke the Language of the Coun∣try
very fluently; by which means their
Conversation was continu'd for a consi∣derable
time; and among other things,
this poor King often enquir'd whether
he was much talk'd of in 
France?
 Af∣ter
a great deal of Discourse of the like
nature, they parted; but the King cau∣sed
M. 
de Gennes
 to be reconducted by for∣ty
Men of his own Guards, and several
Drummers, and presented him with some
of the finest Oxen that could be found
in the Village.


On the 30th. Instant, a Council was
held to determine, whether the Fort
should be kept or slighted: The latter
Advice was follow'd for divers Reasons,
and therefore we drew near, to take all
the Merchandizes that were to be ex∣ported
in our Vessels: They consisted
in several Pieces of Ordnance, a great
quantity of Arms, 
Morphil,
 Wax, Ves∣sels
of Tin and Copper, 
&c.
 Woollen and


Linen-Cloth, printed Calico's, Coral,
Glasses, and other Commodities, in which
a great Trade is carryed on in that
Country.


On the 5th. Day of 
August A. D.
 1695.

the 
Sun of Africa
 pass'd down the Ri∣ver,
to transport certain Merchandizes
and Ammunition to 
Gorea;
 but that
Voyage was undertaken to no purpose,
because the Governour would not furnish
himself with them, without the Consent
of the Company.


On the 14th. Instant,
 a Free-booter of
St. 
Domingo,
 which parted from thence
a Year ago, came to cast Anchor before
us, and having saluted us with three
Cannon-shot, we answer'd her with one.
This Vessel met with the 
Sun of Africa

at 
Gorea,
 by whom she was informed
of the taking of St. 
James
's Fort; and
that since it was determined to demo∣lish
it, some Advantage might be
got by divers Provisions that were left,
as being of no use to us. The same
Day, we suffered a considerable Loss
upon this Occasion: Forasmuch as the

Fruitful
 Pink was appointed to convey
the 
English
 Officers into 
France,
 and
was obliged to pass by 
Cayenna
 to leave
some of our 
Negroes
 there; 150 of


them were shut up in the Hold, lest
they shou'd attempt to make their E∣scape:
But these miserable Wretches,
scarce having room to breathe in, threw
themselves one upon another, as it were
in despair, so that 34 of them were found
stifled.


On the 16th. the 
Fruitful
 Pink being
ready to sail for 
Cayenna,
 saluted us with
her whole Artillery, and we answer'd her
with a Cannon-shot.


The 17th, 18th, 19th. and 20th. Days
of this Month were spent in breaking
the Cannons at St. 
John
's Fort, and un∣dermining
the Walls, from whence we
remov'd on the 21st. to avoid the ill
Accidents that might happen upon the
blowing up of the Place:
 On the 22d.
the Mines sprang, and took very good
effect; except two, which miscarry'd,
and were sprung the same Evening. The
King of 
Bar
 immediately sent to search
among the Ruines for such things as
might turn to his Advantage; and the

Portuguese,
 who had several Colonies on
the River, told us, that they durst not
go thither till after that the King and his
Officers had caus'd every thing to be car∣ry'd
away, which might be serviceable
to them. The 
English
 spent several Years


in building this Fort, which was situated
in the middle of a fine River, where
the Traffick is very considerable; and
the Revenues which they receiv'd from
thence are computed to amount to a
Million; so that the Loss of the Place
cannot be easily repair'd.


This River is navigable even so as to bear
large Barks,
 200 Leagues up the Country,
where it is join'd with that of 
Senegal,

in that place where the 
Niger
 forms its
famous Arms: Its Sides are flat, and cut
with many Channels, to which the Sea
runs up; and the Soil along its Banks
is fertil in Millet, Rice, Tobacco, and
divers sorts of Fruits; affording also
good Pasture for the feeding of nume∣rous
Herds of Oxen. The principal
Fruits that we observ'd in those Parts,
are the 
Banana,
 the 
Tabakomba,
 and the

Plougue.


The 
Banana
 is a long Fruit cover'd
with a yellow and tender Skin; the
Pulp of it being soft like Cotton, and of
a very good taste: It grows on a tender
Stalk, about two or three Fathoms high;
its Leaves are a Fathom long, and of a
proportionate breadth. This Stalk bears
only one single Bunch or Cluster, round
which there may be forty or fifty 
Ba∣nana's;



and when the Bunch is gather∣ed,
the Stalk is to be cut, by reason
that otherwise it cou'd not bring forth
any more Fruit.


The 
Tabakomba
 is almost of the same
Shape as a 
Bon-Chretien
 Pear; its
Peel or Rind is like that of a Pomegra∣nate,
and opens when the Fruit is ripe:
It contains five or six small Fruits of a
Rose-Colour, the Pulp of which is in∣sipid,
and the Stone very large.


The 
Plougues
 or Medicinal-Nuts con∣tain
three small Kernels, that are call'd

Indian
 Pine-Apple Kernels, and which
are us'd by the Apothecaries in the com∣position
of their Medicines.


There is at least as great Plenty of
Wild Beasts, and as much variety of
Game in those Parts, as on the Coasts
of 
Gorea.
 We saw there certain rare
Birds, which might well deserve a Place
in the famous Aviary of 
Versailes,
 by
reason of the admirable Beauty of their
Feathers, or upon account of their ex∣traordinary
Shape; particularly, the Pe∣lican,
which the Inhabitants of the
Country call 
Wide-Throat;
 and the 
Guinee

Peacock. The Pelican resembles a Goose
in its Size and Colour, having on the
lower part of its Bill, which is very long,

The Habit of the Circumcised▪


A Negro playing on ye Balafo







a Bag, capable of holding almost two
Quarts of Water. This Bird common∣ly
pearches upon fome Tree, near the
Banks of a River, waiting till the Fish
swim even with the Surface of the Wa∣ter,
to fall upon them, and even swal∣low
some that are a Foot long. The

Guinee
 Peacock,
 which others call the
Imperial, or the Lady, is black, and
almost of the bigness of a Turkey: It
walks stately, its Neck and Legs being
long, having Feathers of a Violet-Colour
on the Tail, and two Tufts on the
Head, which render it magnificent:
That on the fore-part of the Head is of
a black, and very fine Feather; and the
other behind is of a long thick Hair, of
a yellowish Colour.


The Apes are larger and more mis∣chievous
than in any part of 
Africa;

The Negroes dread them, and cannot
travel alone in the Country without
running the hazard of being attack'd by
these Animals, who often present them
with a Stick, and force them to fight.
I have heard the 
Portugueses
 say, that
they have often seen them hoist up young
Girles about seven or eight Years old,
into Trees, and that they could not be
wrested from them without a great deal


of difficulty. The most part of the
Negroes imagine them to be a Foreign
Nation come to inhabit their Country,
and that they do not speak for fear of
being compell'd to work.


The Air about this River is very un∣wholsom,
by reason of the Rains that
continually fall during six Months in
the Year; that is to say, from 
June

till 
November;
 insomuch that Strangers
can scarce avoid its malign Influence;
for this Air causes lingring Feavers, by
which Men are extremely wasted be∣fore
they die. We experimentally felt
these direful Effects, departing from
thence with about 250 sick Persons, of
whom above two third parts dy'd a lit∣tle
while after. These Rains sometimes
come with terrible Blasts of Wind;
which are so much the more formida∣ble,
in regard that a Vessel may be
suddenly surpriz'd and over-set with
them.


The 
Portugueses
 have many Habitati∣ons
in different Places, and more especi∣ally
in the Village of 
Gilofriee,
 where
they have a small sorry Church. Those
Persons who are desirous to settle in the
Country, of whatever Nation they be,
usually pay a yearly Tribute to the King,

to the value of 50 Crowns, besides the
Presents which they are in a manner
oblig'd to make him, on certain Festi∣vals,
and when he enters their Hutts;
where he always finds something that
may serve for his use, and which these
poor People dare not deny him.


The great Trade which is manag'd in
that River, has render'd the People
much more polite and civiliz'd than those
of 
Gorea:
 They are better 
Mahometans,

and have a greater Veneration for their
Commanders, whom they never accost,
but with one Knee on the Ground, and
throwing Sand over their Heads, as a
mark of their Submission. Their Hutts

are neat, and well built, being made of
a fat binding Earth, which soon hardens:
They are cover'd with Palm-Tree Leaves,
so well fitted, that they cannot be pene∣trated
either by the Rain, or the Heat
of the Sun. They are of a round Fi∣gure,
and cannot be better compar'd
than to our Ice-Houses. The most part
of the Negroes divert themselves there∣in,
with discoursing about the 
Alcoran,

or with playing on a certain Musical In∣strument,
which they call 
Balafo,
 whilst
their Wives are employ'd in tilling the
Ground. The 
Balafo
 is nothing else


but several Pipes of very hard Wood
set in order, which diminish by little
and little in length, and are ty'd toge∣ther
with Thongs of very thin Leather.
These Thongs are twisted about small
round Wands, which are put between e∣very
one of those Pipes, to leave a small
Space: This Instrument very much re∣sembles
one of ours in that particular;
but that of the Negroes is compos'd of
many more parts, in regard that they
fasten underneath ten or twelve Gourds,
the different Sizes of which perform the
same effect as our Organ-Pipes: They
usually play upon it with Sticks, the Ends
of which are cover'd with Leather, to
render the Sound less harsh.


The 
Portugueses
 told us, that the Ne∣groes
who live further up the Country,
with whom they have but small Deal∣ings,
are altogether Savage; boast of
being great Sorcerers, and have little
Religion: That when a King, or one of
the principal Commanders, dies, they
lay them in a new Hut, kill his best be∣lov'd
Wife, with a certain number of
Slaves to serve him in the other World;
and lastly, having said particular Pray∣ers,
and put Provisions and Tobacco
sufficient to last a long time into the Hutt,
they cover it with Earth.



On the 24th. Instant at Noon
 we pas∣sed
down the River, and the next Day
about 8 a-clock in the Morning, we pre∣par'd
to set sail. The Free-booter passing
by us, saluted us with five Guns, and
we answer'd her with one. We were
stearing our Course for 
Brasil,
 and that
Pickeroon for the Red-Sea. We gave the
Ship's Crew two Pieces of Ordnance,
with Powder, Ball, and some Oxen, on
condition that in the Passage they shou'd
set the Negro Prince of 
Assiny
 a-shore
in his own Territories. M. 
de Gennes

had the charge of him, but cou'd not
perform it, without interrupting the Voy∣age
he had undertaken.


On the 26th. and 27th. we had a great
Calm, and on the 28th. a Barrel of
Brandy took Fire in the Hold, but it
was soon put out, by the care that was
taken in applying a great quantity of
wet Clothes. The Number of our sick
Men increasing every Day, and the most
part of them dying for want of neces∣sary
Refreshment, a Council was held on
the 30th. to know whether it were most
expedient to continue our Course to 
Bra∣sil,

or to stand in for some Port: The
latter Advice was follow'd, and it was
determin'd that we shou'd go in quest


of the Islands of Cape 
Verd,
 where the Air
is much more healthful than on the
Coast of 
Guinee.


On the 3d. Day of 
September,
 we had
boisterous Winds, which being contrary
wou'd have driven us off from the I∣slands,
and perhaps wou'd have hinder'd
us from making them: Wherefore we
steer'd our Course for 
Gorea,
 to take in
fresh Provisions, waiting for a more fa∣vourable
Wind to return to the Island of
Cape 
Verd.


On the 5th. at break of Day,
 we di∣scover'd
Land, and at six a-clock in the
Evening we cast Anchor before 
Gorea,

where we took in 15 Oxen, and loaded
some of our Shallops with Water: Then
we set sail again on the 9th. Instant, with
a favourable Gale of Wind.


On the 12th. 13th. and 14th. we had
a great Calm; and on the 15th. at 8 a-clock
in the Morning we discover'd the
Island of 
May,
 from whence we steer'd
our Course for that of St. 
Vincent.


On the 17th. we came within sight
of an Island, the Coasts of which ap∣pear'd
to be very high and foggy. And
indeed, by its height we judg'd it to be
that of St. 
Nicholas.



On the 18th. and 19th. the Winds
were contrary; but on the 19th. and
20th. at Night they favour'd us; and at
two a-clock in the Morning we disco∣ver'd
Land by the Light of the Moon:
We continu'd the rest of the Night a∣bout
the Cape; and at break of Day we
perceiv'd it to be the Island of St. 
Lucia.

At two a-clock in the Afternoon we en∣ter'd
the Channel, which separates the
Island of St. 
Vincent
 from that of St. 
An∣tony;

and when we were arriv'd within
Musket-shot of a great Rock which lay
in form of a Sugar-Loaf in the middle
of that Channel, at the Entrance of St.

Vincent
's Bay, where our Ship was to
cast Anchor; we were becalm'd, and
oblig'd to tow it up with our Shallops
against the Current that carry'd us a∣bove
the Place. We spent the Night in
a perpetual Hurry; for the Wind conti∣nu'd
so little in the same Point, and
veer'd so often, that we durst not fall
into the Bay till break of Day.


On the 22d.
 we set up Tents on the
Land, for our sick Mariners, who were
very numerous; for many of them were
seiz'd with the Scurvy, besides the Fea∣vers
of 
Gambia;
 and of 260 Men be∣longing
to our Ship's Crew, we had on∣ly


80 left who were in a Condition to
Work.


The Island of St. 
Vincent
 is inhabited,

but it is barren, and beset with very
high Mountains: It affords little fresh
Water; Wood is also scarce there, and
it is customary to cast Anchor before it,
only by reason of the Safety of its Har∣bour.
We met with 20 
Portugueses
 of St.

Nicholas
's Island, who were employ'd there
during two Years, in dressing Goat-Skins,
with which this Island abounds: These
Animals were taken with Dogs so well
inur'd to the Game, that each of them
was wont to bring twelve or fifteen eve∣ry
Night. There is also abundance of
Tortoises in that Island, of which there
are different kinds, and some that weigh
three or four hundred Pounds. These
Animals make to Land to lay their Eggs,
hide them in the Sand, and return with∣out
sitting on them: They are not hatch'd
till the end of 17 Days, and continue
during nine of them without being able
to pass to the bottom of the Water, in∣somuch
that three quarters of them are
usually destroy'd by the Birds.


On the 23d. Instant,
 we Mann'd out
our Boat for St. 
Antony
's Island, to
trade for some Provisions; and our Ma∣riners,


conducted by two 
Portugueses
 of
St. 
Vincent,
 went to certain Cottages,
where they were kindly entertain'd by
the Inhabitants, who gave us some Pul∣lets,
and a great quantity of the Fruits
of the Country, 
viz.
 Figs, Raisins, 
Ba∣nana's,

Oranges, Lemmons, and Water-Melons;
telling them at the same time,
that if we sent Word thither in three
Days, they wou'd give notice to the
Village, where we might be supply'd
with Oxen, Hoggs, Pullets, Ducks,
Fruit, and every thing we cou'd desire.
This Village is situated in the middle of
many high Mountains, which render its
Access difficult: There are above 500
Inhabitants capable of bearing Arms, and
a great number of Negro-Slaves. The
Fathers 
Cordeliers
 have a Church there.
The 
Portugueses
 of this Island, as all the o∣ther
of the Islands of Cape 
Verd,
 are of a
swarthy Complexion, but they are ingeni∣ous
People, and very sociable: They feed
on a kind of Bread made of Millet and

Banana's.
 They have numerous Herds
of Oxen, Asses, Goats, and Hogs, with
variety of Fowl; Their Wine is also
good, and their Fruits excellent; inso∣much
that this Island, where the Air
is healthful, and always temperate, may


well pass for a very delightful Place.


On the 26th. at two a-clock in the
Morning, a Merchant-Man of 
Nantes,

that came to salt Tortoises for 
Marti∣nica,

cast Anchor by us. If their Ship's
Crew had known that they shou'd have
met with so good Company, they wou'd
not have enter'd so boldly; but they
were not aware of us till it was too late
to retreat; and if they had prov'd 
En∣glishmen,

they might have paid dear e∣nough
for their Curiosity. These Men
inform'd us of the loss of 
Namur,
 and
told us, that they pass'd by the Island
of St. 
Nicolas,
 where the Inhabitants in∣gag'd
them to bring back their Coun∣trymen,
of whom they had heard no
News since they went to St. 
Vincent.

They kept their Word; so that the 
Por∣tugueses

convey'd the Vessel under the
Wind into a Creek, where there is
greater abundance of Tortoises than in
any other place: They often assisted 'em
in Fishing, and were afterwards carry'd
back to St. 
Nicolas.


On the 27th. Instant, the Pink went
to St. 
Antony
's Island, to fetch the Provi∣sions
that the 
Portugueses
 had promis'd
us, and which we could not obtain till
the first Day of 
October,
 by reason of







Bourse

 Vincent at Cape Verd

the difficulty of conveying 'em to the
Sea-shore. Thus we had 1200 Pullets,
100 Hogs, above 25 Oxen, and a great
quantity of Fruits; the whole Cargo in
exchange for Linen-Cloth, Beads, Look∣ing-Glasses,
Ribbons, Knives, and some
other small Wares of the like Nature,
which contented them much better than
all the Money we cou'd have given 'em;
more especially in regard that they have
not any Harbours in their Island, so that
Vessels very seldom arrive there; and the
King of 
Portugal,
 who receives large
Revenues from thence, sometimes for∣bears
sending any thither during the
term of three Years. All these Provi∣sions,
with a vast quantity of good Fish
that we took in this Bay, serv'd in some
measure to recruit our Fleet.


Amongst the Fish that were caught
by us, we met with one of an extraor∣dinary
beauty in respect of the Rayes
about the Eyes, a great number of Spots
and Hexagonal Marks of a very lively
blue Colour: This Fish is commonly cal∣led
a 
Bourse.


On the 4th. Day,
 at Eight of the
Clock, we set sail with a North-East
Wind, steering our Course again to 
Rio-Janeiro,

or the River of 
January
 on the
Coasts of 
Brasil.



On the 5th. at Night, we pass'd be∣tween
the Islands of St. 
Jago
 and 
Fuogo.

The former is the first of all the Islands
of Cape 
Verd,
 and the See of a Bishop:
The other is only a large Mountain,
that continually burns, where we saw
Fire on the top of it during the whole
Night; and in the Day it only appear'd
to be Smoke. The 
Portugueses
 have of∣ten
endeavour'd to fix settl'd Habitati∣ons
therein, but could never accomplish
their Design, as being perhaps too much
disturb'd by the Cinders, Sulphureous
Matter, and even Stones that are thrown
out of this burning Mountain.


On the 6th. and 7th. we had strong
blasts of Wind, with Thunder and Rain;
and on the 10th. we saw two 
Blowers,

being a sort of small Whales, which
spout up Water very high, and with a
great Noise. We likewise discover'd vast
Shoales of Porpoises, that follow'd us
above two Hours: They are of the size
of a Hogg, swim in Rank and File as
it were so many Companies of Infantry,
and sometimes reach above two Miles in
length.


On the 11th. 12th. 13th. and 14th.
the Rains were continual, and the Winds
very unconstant, so that our Pilots were


very much surpriz'd; for in drawing
near the Coasts of 
Africa,
 they expect∣ed
to meet with the Trade-Winds, which
are very common in those Parts that
lie between the 
Tropicks.
 In the mean
while, our Water diminish'd, half of our
Men were fallen sick, and our Negroes
perish'd daily.


On the 30th. at Night we pass'd the
Equinoctial-Line within a Degree,
 or
thereabouts, of the first Meridian; and
the same Night we observ'd a Comet,
which continu'd till the 19th. of 
No∣vember.

Indeed we were not sensible of
the excessive Heats, and tedious Calms,
with which all the Relations of Voya∣ges
threaten those who cross the 
Torrid
Zone;
 for we always had some fresh
Gales of Wind, and the Nights were ve∣ry
cool.


On the 4th. Day of 
November,
 we
saw abundance of flying Fish, and 
Fre∣gats.

These flying Fish are almost as
big as a Herring, but their Head is more
square; and their Wings are nothing
else, but two very long Fins, that sup∣port
them above the Water as long as
they retain never so little Moisture.
The Gold-Fish and the 
Bonite
 continu∣ally
make War with them in the Wa∣ter,


and the Birds assault them in the
Air.


The 
Frigate
 is a large Bird,
 of a Grey
Colour, having short Legs, Feet like a
Goose, a forked Tail, and the Wings
sometimes seven or eight Foot in com∣pass:
These Birds fly with a great deal
of swiftness, and are to be seen for 300
Leagues.


On the 13th. we gave Orders to the

Felicity
 to spread her Sails, because she
stood in need of being careen'd; and at
the same time, to search for Store-Hou∣ses,
where at our Arrival we might un∣lade
our 
Gambia
 Merchandizes.


On the 17th. we saw a great Flock
of Birds; and on the next Day we dis∣cover'd
the Island of the 
Ascension,
 which
is distant above 150 Leagues from the
Coasts of 
Brasil;
 it is of a small com∣pass,
and very steep.


On the 22d.
 a very remarkable thing
hapned in reference to a Sow with young
that we took at St. 
Antony
's Island. This
Sow pigg'd, and the first of her young
was a Monster, which had the Body of
a Pig, the Ears and Snout of an Ele∣phant;
and above that Snout which
was in the middle of the Forehead, an
Eye with two Apples. This Monster


might have been kept for a Rarity if
it had liv'd; but the Sea kill'd it imme∣diately
after it was brought forth.


On the 24th. at four a-clock in the
Afternoon, we discover'd Land; but the
Winds and Currents being contrary to
us, we were not able to cast Anchor
till the 26th. Instant, which we then did
before the Island of St. 
Ann,
 on the side
of the Continent, from which they are
distant two small Leagues: They for∣merly
serv'd as a place of Retreat for
the 
Hollanders,
 when they attempted the
Conquest of 
Brasil.
 They are three in
number, and the greatest of them lies
in the middle, being about a League
and half in compass, and having a con∣venient
sandy Creek, where good fresh
Water may be taken in. There are al∣so
some wild Fruits, as Purslain and
small channell'd Cherries, which are al∣most
of the same Taste as ours.


In the Woods,
 with which these Islands
are beset, one may hear a melodious
Harmony, made by a great number of
small Birds, with fine Feathers: Among
others, there are 
Perroquets, Cardinals,

and 
Colibries.
 The Cardinal is a kind
of small Sparrow, the Wings and Tail
of which are black, and the rest of


the Body of a very lively Scar∣let.


The 
Colibrie
 is a small Bird no big∣ger
than a May-Bugg, with green Fea∣thers:
It has a Bill somewhat long, and
feeds on the Juice of Flowers like our
Bees: Its Nest is as large as an Egg, and
is so much the more curious, in regard
that it is made of fine Cotton, and hung
up with very small Threads. On the
Sea-Coasts there are 
Dotterils
 in so great
abundance, that our Mariners sometimes
kill'd five or six of them with a Stick
at one blow. These Birds are as big
as Ducks, and commonly fly about the
Islands and the Rocks that are not ex∣tended
far in the Sea. The two other
Islands are much less, and form with
the greater, to the North and South,
certain Channels, which one may pass
through, as occasion serves. The Nor∣thern
on the side of the Continent, has
a Creek very convenient for the ca∣reening
of Vessels; but the Southern is
only a huge round Rock.


Over-against the Coast stands a small
Village, inhabited by the 
Portugueses,

where we sent our Shallop to get some
Provisions for the sick Mariners: Our
Men found the Inhabitants under Arms,





map of the mouth of the River Ianeiro

The Mouth

of the River

Ianeiro

on the Coast of Brasil.


A Scale of one League







and ready to hinder our landing upon
the least suspicion. These People were
pillag'd some Years ago by Rovers, and
ever since stand upon their Guard as
soon as they discover the approach of
any Vessel. However we found means
to purchase a couple of Oxen, a dry'd
Fish, several Cheeses, and Pulse, with
some Fruits, at a dear rate.


On the 27th. we took in fresh Water,
and the next Day set sail for the River of

Janeiro.


On the 29th. we doubl'd Cape 
Frie,

and on the 30th. at eight a-clock in the
Morning, supposing that we had almost
made the River,
 we let off a Gun, to
give notice that we stood in need of a
Pilot; but having tack'd about on all
sides till three a-clock in the Afternoon,
without hearing any News, and without
being able to discover the Mouth; We
cast Anchor within three Leagues of the
Land, and sent our Boat along the Coast,
to search it out. The 
Portugueses
 of
St. 
Ann
 had told us, that there was at
the Entrance, a huge Rock in form of
a Sugar-Loaf; but instead of one, we
discern'd two, at a great distance one
from another; so that we were much
perplex'd, not knowing how to steer our
Course.



Our Boat lay at Anchor during the
Night, at the Mouth of the River, un∣der
the Cannon of the Forts, which
caus'd it to be stop'd. At break of Day
the Officer, who was in the Boat, went
to meet the Governour of the Place,
and return'd at six a-clock in the Even∣ning,
to inform us that the Inhabitants
scrupl'd to permit us to enter, by reason
(as they gave it out) of the great num∣ber
of our Sick Men: But it is more
probable,
 that not being accustom'd to
see any other Ships than those of their
own Nation, and fearing lest we might
be engag'd in a War against them,
they were so extremely terrify'd at our
Arrival, that as soon as our 
Corvette

(which enter'd eight Days before us)
appear'd, all the Women retir'd to the
Country, with the best Effects of the
Town.


At six a-clock in the Morning, we
prepar'd to draw near, and at nine an
Officer came, who caus'd us to cast An∣chor
within half a Cannon-shot of the
Forts, which are built on both sides of
that River. Afterwards he went to
make a Report to the Governour, and
promis'd us that he wou'd use his ut∣most
Endeavours to get an Order for the
sending of a Pilot.



In the mean while, there arose a strong
Blast of Wind, which oblig'd us to hoist
up Sail, by reason that our Ship got
loose from Anchor, and ran upon a Shelf
of Rocks which is in the middle of the
River: But the Commanders of the
Forts, who had Orders to stop our
Course, and who, without having any
regard to the apparent Danger we were
in of perishing at that instant, imagin'd
that we design'd to enter without their
leave, discharg'd twelve or fifteen Can∣non-Balls
a-cross our Masts, to oblige
us to cast Anchor: Thus they made a
Bravado, insulting over us, because they
knew that we stood in need of their
Assistance, and durst not resent their Af∣fronts.
Therefore we made haste to
cast Anchor; and about a quarter
of an Hour after, an Officer came on
board, who left us a Pilot, and a Phy∣sician
to visit our sick Men: He told
us that we might weigh Anchor, and
that he was going to the Fort to know
the Governour's Pleasure: But as we
were under sail, before he arriv'd there,
we receiv'd ten Cannon-shot more,
which shatter'd our Flag, dismounted
one of the Port-Holes in the Gunner's
Room, and pass'd between the Shrouds,


without hurting any one of our Crew.
Then we went to cast Anchor with the

Seditious
 Pink, within a small League
of the Town; neither wou'd the Go∣vernour
suffer the 
Sun of Africa,
 nor the

Glutton
 Frigate, to enter, by reason that
he had Orders (as he pretended) from
the King of 
Portugal,
 not to admit above
three Foreign Men of War into the
Harbour.


The next Night, at two or three a-clock,
the 
Sun of Africa,
 which conti∣nu'd
still at the Mouth of the River,
got loose from Anchor; and forasmuch
as the Current drove her on the abovemention'd
Shelf of Rocks, so that she
could not be stay'd by any of the An∣chors,
she discharg'd several Cannon-shot,
and made Fires upon all the Masts,
as a Signal to get Succour: Whereupon
we sent our Shallop, which got her off
from that place, where she would have
been inevitably lost without their Assi∣stance.
This Ship set sail the same Day
for 
La Isla Grande,
 which is twenty
Leagues distant from thence; and the
Pink cast Anchor in a small Bay at the
Mouth of the River, where she waited
till the 
Corvette
 came up to enter. M.

de Gennes
 made a Complaint to the Go∣vernour,


of the Insult that was offer'd
us at our Entrance, and that the King's
Ships were basely left in danger: He
excus'd himself upon account that the
People were ready to make an Insurre∣ction;
that it was none of his Fault
that we did not enter at first; and that
for the future he wou'd serve us as far
as it lay in his power.


On the 4th. Instant,
 we set our sick
Men a-shore in a small Village that
fronts the Town on the other side the
River.


On the 5th. The Governour sent us a
Pilot, who caus'd us to cast Anchor
within a quarter of a League of the
Town;
 which we did not salute, because
they refus'd to return us an equal num∣ber
of Shot.


On the 15th. a Vessel enter'd which
came from the Bay of 
All-Saints.


On the 17th. and 18th. two other
Vessels arriv'd that came from the Coast
of 
Angola,
 loaden with Negroes.


On the 20th. we paid our Ship.


On the 22d. the 
Felicity
 set out for

La Isla Grande,
 and the 
Glutton
 Pink en∣ter'd
in its place, to take in some Quin∣tals
of Bisket, made of Meal that we
brought out of 
Europe.
 She likewise


took in some Salt-meats, Meal of 
Ma∣nioc

or 
Yuca,
 with 
Cassave,
 Rice, 
Mayz,
Guildive,
 and other Provisions, which
we purchas'd with 
Gambia
 Merchandi∣zes,
upon which we lost a great deal
in the exchange,
 by reason that the Go∣vernour
having prohibited the Inhabi∣tants
to trade with us, and taking up∣on
him to be the sole Seller and
Buyer, we were oblig'd to afford our
Commodities at a cheaper rate than
they bear in 
Europe;
 which sufficiently
shews the sinister Practices of that Na∣tion,
of whom three quarters are ori∣ginally

Jews.
 We likewise sold our Ne∣groes,
but retain'd the most robust of
them, to recruit part of our Fleet,
which the Sickness of 
Gambia
 had much
impair'd; our single Ship having alrea∣dy
lost above 50 Men.


We continu'd till the 27th. Instant in
this River, which may without doubt
pass for one of the safest and most con∣venient
in 
America.
 Before it falls into
the Sea, it forms a large Bay, where
Vessels ride as it were in a private Port.
The bottom of it is firm, and the
Winds are broken by the means of the
high Lands, with which it is encom∣pass'd:
The Shelf of Rocks that lies


at its Mouth, and by which one can∣not
pass without coming within half a
Cannon-shot of the Forts that command
it, contributes much to the security of
the Harbour.


At the distance of two Leagues from
the Mouth of the River, stands the Ci∣ty
of St. 
Sebastian,
 which is an Episcopal
See, the usual Place of Residence of
the Governour of the Province. 'Tis si∣tuated
on the Western side of the Ri∣ver,
and in a fine Plain, surrounded with
high Mountains: 'Tis large and well
built, and the Streets are Streight, so
that the magnificent Structures of the

Jesuits
 and 
Benedictins
 that terminate
them on both sides, each on a small
Ascent, render the Prospect very delight∣ful:
It has no Fortification on that side
towards the Country; and 'tis defended
only by a small Fort on the Sea-shore
below the 
Jesuite
's College.


The Inhabitants are polite,
 and en∣dow'd
with a Gravity customary to their
Nation: They are Rich, take much de∣light
in Trading, and keep a great num∣ber
of Negro-Slaves, besides divers en∣tire
Families of 
Indians,
 whom they
maintain in their Sugar-Plantations, and
whose Liberty they are not willing to


retrench, as being the Natives of the
Country. Their Slaves for the most
part manage all their Houshold-Affairs,
which renders them so dissolute and es∣feminate,
that they will not vouchsafe
to stoop to take up a Pin themselves,
for which they have occasion. Luxury
is so predominant among them, that not
only the Burghers, but even the Monks
may have to do with common Harlots,
without fearing the Censures or Re∣proaches
of the People, who have a ve∣ry
great Respect for them. Uncleanness
is not the only Vice peculiar to these
lewd Monks: They live in gross Igno∣rance,
so that very few of them under∣stand
the 
Latin
 Tongue; and it is to be
fear'd, that as they strive even to out∣vie
the 
Sodomites
 in their Debaucheries,
they may one Day partake of the like
Punishment. There are vast Multitudes
of 
Cordeliers, Carmelites,
 and 
Benedictin

Monks every where in the Territories
of 
Brasil;
 but they take little Care of
the Conversion of an infinite number of
poor 
Indians,
 who stand in need of be∣ing
instructed in the Mysteries of the
Gospel; and there are only eight or ten
Reverend 
Capuchin
 Fathers of the 
French

Nation, and some Jesuits, throughout


that vast Continent, who take Pains in
performing the Functions of their Mission
with an extraordinary Zeal.


I cannot forbear relating a small Ad∣venture
which happen'd to a young Man
of our Squadron,
 who fell out with one
of the Inhabitants, and was oblig'd to
draw his Sword in his own Defence;
but perceiving himself alone, and press'd
with a great number of 
Portugueses,
 he
thought fit to retire, and seeing the Door
of the 
Carmelite
's Monastery open'd, he
made bold to enter, not doubting but to
meet with a sure Sanctuary in that Place;
but he soon found the contrary, for one
of these charitable Monks immediately
struck him on the Head with a Hanger,
the Marks of which Wound will always
appear during his whole Life-time: Then
many others rush'd in, and beat him
with Cudgels, and at last put him again
into the Hands of the Inhabitants, who
had Compassion on him, and detested
the barbarous Proceedings of the Monks.
The Reflections I have made on these
counterfeit Monks, ought not to give
Offence to those who make a Consci∣ence
of discharging their Duty; since
the Invectives made against such Liber∣tines▪
serve only to augment the Respect


that ought to be had for those who
seek for an occasion to shew the effects
of a true Zeal, and use all possible means
for the propagating the Christian Reli∣gion,
even to the apparent hazard of
their Lives.


The Country lying about this River
affords good Pasture,
 bringing forth a∣bundance
of Tobacco and Canes, of
which the finest Sugar is made; and
also a kind of very strong Brandy,
which we call 
Guildive.
 The latter
comes of Slips, are full of Knots, that
put forth Leaves like those of Reeds,
and grow on Ridges as Corn: These
Canes when gather'd, are carry'd to
the Mill to be ground, and the Juice
that they yield runs through several
Pipes into the Cauldrons, where the Su∣gar
is made and refin'd, almost after the
same manner as Salt-Petre. The Soil is
likewise very fruitful in Rice, Mayz,
and 
Manioc,
 which are Roots that put
forth a small Shrub four or five Foot
high, and are propagated of Slips: The
Fields in which they are planted, and
where they are left standing two or
three Years, are like those of our Hemp-Closes:
These Roots, which serve in∣stead
of Bread in a great part of 
Ame∣rica;



are as thick and long as Carrots:
They are usually grated with Rasps made
for that purpose, and Meal is made of 'em
after having squeez'd out all their Juice,
which is the rankest Poyson in the World,
and which they take care to drain off
into Places under-ground, lest the Cat∣tle
shou'd drink it. The most part of
the 
Portugueses
 feed on this Meal, such
as it is; and others make of it a kind
of small Cakes, which they bake on I∣ron-Plates
appropriated to that use.
There is abundance of Fruit and Pulse
in those parts: Cabbiges, Onions, Let∣tuces,
Purcelain, Melons, Water-Melons,
Goads, Grapes, and many other Fruits
that we have in 
Europe,
 thrive there,
and come to perfection: But the pecu∣liar
Fruits of the Country are Oranges,

Banana's, Ananas's,
 Potato's, 
Ighname's,
Coco's, Goyaves,
 and many others, of
which they make very good Confe∣ctions.


The 
Ananas
 grows like an Artichoak,
and resembles a large Pine-Apple: Its
Leaves are long, thick, and arm'd with
small Prickles. It bears a Crown of the
same Leaves, and may be esteemed as
the best Fruit in the whole Continent of

America.



The Potato and 
Ighname,
 are Roots
very like the 
Toupinambous;
 The former
is of the taste of a Chesnut, and is usual∣ly
eaten broil'd or roasted in Embers.
The 
Ighname
 is somewhat insipid, but
much more wholsome and larger than
the Potato, but both these sorts of
Roots are of singular use to make very
savory Pottage.


The 
Coco
 grows upon a Tree which is
much like a Palm-Tree: This Fruit is
very large, and has nothing but what
may be apply'd to some Use: It is co∣ver'd
with a kind of Tow, which may
serve to caulk Vessels, better than Hemp:
This Tow being taken off, we meet
with a large hard Nut, of an Oval Fi∣gure;
of which Cups and other Toys of
the like nature are usually made, that bear
the Name of 
Coco's.
 This Nut contains
a white Kernel, of the Taste of a Hazel
Nut, lying round about of the thickness
of one's Finger: Lastly, the Middle is
fill'd with a cool Liquor resembling thin
Milk, about the Quantity of a large
Glass-full; insomuch that this Fruit alone
may serve for a Man's Sustenance: And
indeed the most part of the 
Indians
 do
not trouble themselves about providing
any Victuals, when they know that they


shall meet with Coco-Trees in the pla∣ces
through which they are to pass.


The 
Goyave
 is somewhat bigger than a
Nut: Its Pulp is red, very stony, and
of the Taste of a Peach. The Tree
that bears this Fruit resembles our Plum-Trees.


There are also numerous Herds of
Oxen, Hogs, and Sheep, with variety
of Game, and several sorts of Fowl, but
every thing is sold 
t an excessive dear
Rate. The Fleet that arrives there every
Year from 
Portugal,
 brings Wine, Meal,
Oil, Cheese; Linnen and Woollen Cloth,
and all other necessary Merchandizes;
and returns laden with Sugar, Leather,
and Train-Oil; from whence arises a
considerable Revenue to the King of 
Por∣tugal.

Formerly they had great Quanti∣ties
of Tobacco, but at present the Sale
of it is forbidden, as one of the greatest
Obstacles to the Trade of the Bay of

All Saints:
 'Tis also prohibited to deal in
Corn and Wine, to prevent the interrupt∣ing
of the 
European
 Commerce, of which
the Inhabitants may make considerable
Advantage, as well as those of St. 
Paul,

in the Territories of St. 
Vincent,
 whose
Political Government is so Remarkable,


that it may not be amiss to give some
Account of it by the way.


This Town,
 which is situated Ten
Leagues up the Country, derives its Ori∣ginal
from an Association of Robbers of
all Nations, who by little and little,
form'd a great Town, and a kind of
Common-Wealth, where they made a
Law, not to admit a Governour. They
are surrounded with high Mountains; so
that one cannot enter, or go out, but
thro' a 
Defilé
 or narrow Passage, where
they keep a strong Guard, for fear of be∣ing
surpriz'd by the 
Indians,
 with whom
they almost continually make War, and lest
their Slaves should find Means to escape.
These 
Paulists
 usually march 40 or 50 in
a Body, arm'd with Bows and Arrows,
which they use more dexterously than
any Nation in the World: They traverse
the whole Continent of 
Brasil,
 passing
as far as the River of 
Plata,
 or to that of
the 
Amazons,
 and return at the End of
four or five Months, sometimes with
above 300 Slaves, whom they drive as
Herds of Oxen; and having tamed a lit∣tle,
they dispose of them in the Country
to till the Ground, or employ them in
fishing for Gold, which they find in so great
quantity, that the King of 
Portugal,
 to


whom they carefully send a fifth Part, re∣ceives
every Year above 8 or 900 Marks:
They pay him this Tribute not out of a
motive of Fear, for they are more potent
than he, but to follow the Custom of
their Ancestors, who not being at first
well settled in their Retreat, endeavour∣ed
to withdraw themselves from Subje∣ction
to their Governours, under pre∣tence
of managing the King's Affairs, to
whom they own themselves at present,
to be Tributaries, but not Subjects, that
they may shake off the Yoke on the first
Opportunity.


On the 25th. instant,
 we set our sick
Men on board again, who, except five
or six, were very hearty. The Com∣mander
of the Place where they lodg'd,
was a generous old Gentleman, of great
Integrity, and was not at all tainted
with the sordid Principles of his Coun∣trymen;
For he entertain'd our sick Ma∣riners
with a Paternal Charity, supplying
them with Eggs, Confits, Wine, and ge∣nerally
with every thing that was ne∣cessary
for them, at his own proper Costs
and Charges; nay he offer'd to retain
the weakest of them in his own House
till our Return.



On the 27th. we set sail, and pass'd
between the Forts, with our Cannons
mounted, and Matches lighted, being
all ready to answer them if they shou'd
attempt to disturb us about the Salute
at parting, or shou'd make us wait for
the Governour's Orders. We no longer
stood in need of them, of which they
were also very sensible: They all ap∣pear'd
in Ranks on their 
Parapets,
 and
seem'd to be overjoy'd at our depar∣ture,
by reason that they were tir'd
with the continual Guards that they
kept during the time of our Abode a∣mong
them. The Governour thought
himself so little secure, that he sum∣mon'd
all the Inhabitants within four
Leagues round about. We were no
sooner gone, but he caus'd a Fort, fur∣nish'd
with some Pieces of Ordnance,
to be built below the Town on a small
Island, which commands the Road, and
where the 
French
 settl'd when this River
was first discover'd.


On the 29th. after a great Calm, we
cast Anchor at seven a-clock in the E∣vening
in the Channel of 
La Isla Grande;

and on the 30th. the Heat was so ex∣cessive,
that we were ready to burn even
in the Water. In the Afternoon a gentle

Breeze came off from the Main, which
moderated the Heat of the Sun; where∣upon
we set sail, and having made three
Leagues, cas
 Anchor by the 
Sun of A∣frica,

within a Musket-shot of the Land,
and in a sandy and very convenient
Creek, where Vessels may be shelter'd
from all manner of Winds, and where
one may take in the best fresh Water.


La Isla Grande
 or 
the Great Island,
 be∣ing
about 18 Leagues in compass, lies
high, and is beset with Woods of a
prodigious thickness, insomuch that one
cannot walk in them 100 Paces toge∣ther:
But there are entire Plains of O∣range-Trees
and Lemmon-Trees, with
much variety of wild Fruits; and a∣mong
others the Pear of 
Mapou,
 which
bears a sort of Red Cotton, and of
which Quilts are made, that are so ex∣tremely
durable, that they can scarce
be worn out; for by exposing them to
the Sun from time to time, the Cotton
swells again of it self, and the Quilt be∣comes
as it were new. We met with a∣nother
sort of Fruit, which is as big as
a small Nut, and seems to have the
crown'd Head of a Clove. There are
also many of those Animals that we call

Tatous,
 and the Scales of which serve


to adorn Apothecaries Shops: Their
Flesh is firm, and has the taste of fresh
Pork.


On the Coast over-again
 this Creek,
stands a large Town belonging to the

Portugueses,
 where there are about four
or five hundred Inhabitants, and two
Convents, 
viz.
 one of 
Carmelites,
 and
the other of the 
Cordeliers.
 We there
bought some Provisions, 
viz.
 Oxen,
Fowl, dry'd Fish, and four 
Pyrogues,

which cost us from forty to eighty
Crowns: These are large 
Canoos,
 very
long, and made of one single Tree
hollow'd: They are light, fit for De∣scents,
and capable of holding 60 Men.
The Governour of 
Rio-Janeiro
 sent on
purpose to forbid the Inhabitants to sell
us any sorts of Commodities whatever;
but they had not much regard to his
Prohibition, for they furnish'd us with
every thing we desir'd. They have all
Habitations in the Mountains, and affect
to be as free as the 
Paulists.


On the 5th. Day of 
January A. D.
 1696.

after having taken in fresh Water and
Wood, we set sail for the Streights of

Magellan.


On the 6th. 7th. 8th. and 9th. we
had a great Calm; and on the 10th.

Pag. 66.


THE STRAIGHT OF
MAGELLAN


A Scale of Leagues







being come within forty Leagues of the
Land, we began to stand off from the
Coast at that distance, to avoid the
Shelves of Sand that lie at the Mouth
of the River of 
Plata,
 and which run
very far into the Main.


On the 21st. and 22d. at Night, as we
were sailing a-cross Cape St. 
Antony,
 we
lost sight of the 
Felicity,
 altho' the
Moon shone bright, the Sea was calm,
and the Wind moderate; neither could
the Fault be attributed to any thing, but
the Negligence of those Mariners who
were then upon the Watch, and who
relying too much on the calmness of
the Weather, fell asleep. We discharg'd
divers Cannon-shot, and all steer'd dif∣ferent
Courses, in quest of that Ship, but
it was to no purpose.


On the 23d. we saw a great many
Sea-Wolves lying asleep on their Backs,
upon the Surface of the Water.


On the 26th. and 27th. we had a
dreadful Storm of Thunder, and much
Rain.


On the 29th. we saw some Whales,
Sea-Pies, and prodigious Flocks of other
Birds, that follow'd us as it were so
many Ducks.



On the 30th. we saw abundance of Sea-Weeds,
which made us conjecture we
were near Land; but having sounded,
it appear'd that we were still distant from
it above forty Leagues.


On the 31st. the Sea was all over co∣ver'd
with small Cray-Fish, insomuch
that it might well be call'd the 
Red-Sea;

We took up above 10000 of them in
Baskets.


On the 1st. and 2d. of 
February,
 the
Winds were boisterous, and the Sea ran
high.


On the 4th. at Noon, we discover'd
the Cape of St. 
Ynes de las-Bareras:
 The
Lands thereabouts are low, and as far as
we cou'd discern, very barren: We dis∣cern'd
a very thick Smoke, which in∣duc'd
us to believe that there were some
Inhabitants. The most part of Naviga∣tors
who have sail'd on those Coasts,
and who have publish'd Relations of
their Voyages, affirm, that when the Sa∣vages
discover the Arrival of any Ves∣sels,
they usually make great Fires, and
offer Sacrifices to the Devil, to conjure
him to raise Storms to destroy them.


On the 5th. and 6th. the Winds were
very variable, and the Weather hazy.



On the 7th. at three a-clock in the
Morning, the Pink let off a Gun, to
give us notice that she descry'd Land,
whereupon we cast Anchor, because it
was very requisite for us to discover it;
and at break of Day we discern'd a
Cape, which our Pilot, and two of our
Officers, who had before pass'd the
Streights of 
Magellan,
 assur'd us to be
that of 
The Virgins.
 The Winds veer'd,
and became contrary, so that we were
not able to cast Anchor, to make any
Discovery.


On the 8th. the Winds still continu'd
contrary to us; and at two a-clock in
the Afternoon blew with so great impe∣tuosity,
that our Cable broke; neither
could we hoise up our Sails, which were
taken in, to give less Advantage to the
Wind; forasmuch as there was no pro∣bability
of being able to carry any Sail,
we suffer'd our selves to lie by, at the
mercy of the Waves, till the next Day
at four a-clock in the Morning, when
the Fury of the Wind being somewhat
abated, we drew near the Land, and at
Noon cast Anchor at the Mouth of the
River of 
Sancta Cruz,
 there to wait for
a favourable Gale, to rejoyn our Vessels.
We scarce let fall Anchor, but the Storm


was appeas'd, the Sea became calm, and
we made as much Sail as we could that
Day.


We doubl'd the Cape at Night, and
at break of Day came up with our Fleet,
and steer'd our Course to the above∣mention'd
Promontory,
 which we sup∣pos'd
to be that of the 
Virgins;
 choosing
rather to follow the Directions of the
Navigators who had already cruis'd a∣bout
those Coasts, than that of the Sea-Charts,
which are often mistaken in
places that are so little frequented: How∣ever
we insensibly drove upon a Shelf,
from whence it would have been very
difficult to get off, if we had not time∣ly
discover'd our Error by sounding:
Therefore we immediately chang'd our
Course, and lengthen'd the Coast, bear∣ing
but little Sail.


On the 11th. Instant, we discover'd
another Cape, very like the former, and
altho' we had scarce reason to doubt it
to be that of the 
Virgins,
 yet we could
not be well satisfy'd till we found it by
experience. We tack'd about for some
time, till the Foggs were dispers'd, and
at Noon we enter'd the Straight, where
we cast Anchor at four a-clock in the
Afternoon, at the Entrance of the Bay


of 
Possession,
 with a favourable Wind and
Current.


On the 12th. at break of Day, we
prepar'd to set sail, but there was so
little Wind, that we were not able to
make three Leagues during the whole
Day.


On the 13th. at break of Day, we
set out again, and made as much sail
as the Tides wou'd permit us. At four
a-clock in the Afternoon we doubled
the Cape 
Entrana,
 and cast Anchor at
the Entrance of the Bay of 
Boucaut.

We there saw several Whales, and a
great number of Porpoises all over white
except their Head and Tail.


On the 14th. we weigh'd Anchor,
and tack'd about till Noon, when the
Tide being contrary to us, we were ob∣lig'd
to cast Anchor within two Leagues
of the Land, in the middle of 
Boucaut

Bay. The Coast is flat, barren, and
destitute both of fresh Water and Wood.
We there met with Snipes, and many
Flocks of Sea-Pies; and some of our
Mariners told us, that a League up the
Land, they had seen Buffles and Goats.
There is also (as everywhere through∣out
the Streights) a prodigious quanti∣ty
of Cockles and Muscles, which are


not at all inferiour to those of 
Cha∣ronne.

We found some, the Shells of
which were of an admirable Beauty,
and weigh'd half a pound.


On the 16th.
 we weather'd Cape

Gregory,
 and at Noon cast Anchor with∣in
a small League of St. 
George
's Island,
to which we could not come nearer,
by reason that we were becalm'd, and
the Tides began to run contrary. This
Island being about a League in Compass,
is high and barren, yet we found there
some Mushrooms, many Sea-Pies, and
several Hutts of Savages abandon'd. We
also took some 
Penguins,
 from which
the Island derives its Name, which was
impos'd by the 
English,
 by reason of
a great quantity of this sort of Birds
which they found therein: They are
somewhat larger than Geese, have short
Legs, with Grey and very thick Fea∣thers;
Their Wings are bare without
any Feathers, and serve only instead of
Finns: They live for the most part in
the Water, retire to Land to sleep, and
make Holes in the Ground like Foxes.
The most part of our Company spent
the Night there, to have the pleasure
of viewing the Sea-Wolves:
 These A∣nimals
climb up steep Rocks, sit on


their Tails like Monkeys, and make a
dreadful noise to call their Mates: When
they bring forth Young, they carry them
into the Woods, supply them with Fish,
and tend them as carefully as an indul∣gent
Mother does her Children.


On the 18th. a blustering Wind arose,
which oblig'd us to stand in again for

Boucaut-Bay,
 where we cast Anchor in
the Evening, under shelter of Cape 
Gre∣gory:

The Pink follow'd us, and the
other Vessels were not long in coming
up.


On the 19th, and 20th. it was exces∣sive
cold, and the Winds grew more
boisterous. We saw great Fires on the
Island of 
Fuogo,
 and the Savages seem'd
to be desirous to converse with us, but
the Sea ran so high, th
 we could not
come near them.


On the 21th. we set sail again, dou∣bled
Cape 
Gregory,
 and having cross'd
St. 
George
's Island, along which we coast∣ed
with Plummet in hand, we suddenly
found our selves fallen upon the Point of
a Shelf: We cast Anchor to sound, and
continu'd our Course again an hour af∣ter.
At 5 a-Clock in the Evening, we
cast Anchor within six Leagues of St.

George
's Island, in a Creek, where the


Coast arises delightfully, and begins to
be beset with Woods: There are divers
small Rivers, where very good Water
may be taken in, and on the Banks of
which we met with Salery, Gooseberries,
Foxes, Bustards, Thrushes, Ducks, and
Cormorants, and abundance of other
Sea-Fowl.


On the 22th, and 23th. the Winds
were contrary.


On the 24th. we set sail, and at Noon
came up again with our Vessels, which
we left at St. 
George
's Island, and which
had cast Anchor within two Leagues of

Famine
 Bay: We took in there very
good fresh Water, but not without some
difficulty, by reason that the Coast was
full of Rocks. In that place we had the
first sight of the Savages,
 of whom
about Eight or Ten on the Sea-shore were
making certain Bark-Canoos, which they
did not abandon, but entreated us by Signs
not to meddle with them. Among these
Savages was a robust old Woman, who
appear'd to be Aged about 80 Years, and
who seem'd in a manner to Command 'em.
They were arm'd with Slings, Bows and
Arrows, and were attended with 5 or 6
little Dogs, which apparently serv'd 'em
for Hunting: Their Arrows were point∣ed

with a sharp Flint-Stone very arti∣ficially
cut, in form of a Serpent's
Tongue: They also made fit large pieces
of Flint to cut Wood, not having the
use or knowledge of Iron.


These Savages are robust, and of a
tall Stature, their Complexion being of
an Olive-Colour: Their Hair is black,
long, and cut above their Head in form
of a Crown. They usually paint their
Faces, Arms, and several other parts of
their Body, with a white Tincture.
Notwithstanding the excessive Cold, they
always go naked; except that their
Shoulders are cover'd with the Skins of
Sea-Dogs and Sea-Wolves. They are
destitute of Religion, and free from all
manner of Care. They have no settled
Habitation, but rove up and down,
sometimes in one place, sometimes in
another. Their Hutts are made only of
a Semi-Circle of Branches, which they
set up, and let one into another, to
shelter themselves from the Wind. These
are the famous 
Patagons
 whom some
Authors avouch to be eight or ten
Foot high, and of whom they tell so
many strange Tales, even making them
swallow whole Pails full of Wine: How∣ever
they appear'd to us to be very sober;


and the tallest among them was not a∣bove
six Foot high.


On the 25th.
 we prepar'd to set Sail,
but had scarce pass'd Cape 
Froward,

when we found the Winds variable and
contrary; insomuch that not being able
to cast Anchor, we were oblig'd to pass
the Cape in the Night.


On the 26th. at break of Day, the
Fury of the Winds being somewhat al∣lay'd,
we set Sail again. At two a-clock
in the Afternoon we doubl'd Cape

Froward
 and Cape 
Holland
 at ten at
Night,
 but with terrible Blasts of Wind
that came from between two Moun∣tains,
and for the most part surpriz'd us
in the midst of a great Calm. At Mid∣night
there arose a high Wind, which
oblig'd us to stand in for some Port;
and the first Anchorage that we could
meet with, was two Leagues above Cape

Froward,
 in a spacious and very conve∣nient
Bay, where we continu'd till the
3d. of the next Month, to take in Wood
and fresh Water, in a River which there
falls into the Sea, and where the Shal∣lops
ride at flowing Water. In a little
Island situated in the middle of this Ri∣ver,
we met with a dead Body half
rotten, and cover'd with about a Foot

of Earth, but we cou'd not distinguish
whether it were the Corps of an 
Eu∣ropean

or of a Savage, only the Skins
of Sea-Wolves, which we found hard
by, induc'd us to believe that he was a
Native of the Country. This Bay is not
mark'd in the Charts; therefore we cal∣led
it the 
French
 Bay, and impos'd on
the River the Name of Monsieur 
de
Gennes.


On the 3d. of 
March
 we put out to
Sea, with a favourable Gale; but we had
scarce doubl'd Cape 
Froward,
 when the
Winds veer'd after their usual manner,
with Blasts that came by Fits, and fell
foul on our Vessel when we were least
aware of it. We pass'd the Cape in the
Night, the Winds blew f
h, and we
were oblig'd to stand in two Leagues
above the 
French
 Bay, which we were
not able to make.


On the 5th. we discover'd 
Famine
-Bay,

so call'd, because the Inhabitants
of a new Colony of 
Spaniards
 were
there miserably starv'd to death, which
Colony was settl'd by 
Philip
 II. King of

Spain,
 who endeavour'd by that means
to hinder the Passage of Foreigners to
the Southern Sea. This Bay is large,
having a firm bottom, so that 40 Ships


may conveniently ride at Anchor there∣in.
There are spacious Plains round a∣bout,
which may be sown with divers
sorts of Grains. There is also great
plenty of Game; and 'tis probable that
the 
Spaniards
 might find more in those
Parts, if it were not destroy'd by the
Savages.


On the 6th. we weigh'd Anchor, and
doubl'd the Capes 
Froward
 and 
Holland,

where we felt, as at other times, very
furious Blasts of Wind; but the next
Day at Noon, we cast Anchor two
Leagues below Port 
Gallant.


On the 8th. a high Wind arose, which
drove the 
Sun of Africa
 from her An∣chor,
and forc'd her to stand in for the

French
 Bay


On the 9th. at Noon, the Winds
were as favourable as could be wish'd
for; yet we could not take the Advan∣tage,
by reason that we were oblig'd to
wait for the 
Sun of Africa,
 which did
not appear till the next Morning at
break of Day: Then we prepar'd to set
Sail, but the Winds immediately veer'd,
and became contrary, with a great deal
of Hail and Rains so that we were ob∣lig'd
to cast Anchor a League below Port

Gallant.



The Winds continu'd contrary to us,
till the 20th. Instant, being very sharp,
and there fell abundance of Rain, Hail,
and Snow, with which the Mountains
are cover'd during the whole Year. We
took in fresh Water and Wood, and saw
a great number of Whales.


On the 20th.
 we set sail with a fa∣vourable
Wind, but it soon return'd to
its wonted Career, and we could only
make the Road of Port 
Galant,
 where
we continu'd fifteen Days longer, with
cold Winds, a great deal of Rain
and Snow. This Road is large, and
shelter'd from the Eastern Winds. The
Situation of the Harbour is pleasant and
very commodious, two small Rivers fal∣ling
into it. There are also to be seen
the finest Shells in the World, with va∣riety
of Fowl, 
viz.
 Larks, Thrushes,
Ducks, and abundance of Sea-Pies. We
often heard the Cries of the Savages
in the Mountains, but could not see
them.


Forasmuch as our Provisions began to
fail, the Season being already very far
advanc'd, and there was no longer any
hopes to meet with favourable Winds
to convey us into the Southern Sea; we
held a Council on the 3d. Day of 
April,



and it was determin'd that if the Wind
did not change within the space of two
Days, we should return to 
La Isla Grande,

to take in Provisions, in order to seek
our Fortunes elsewhere. It may be easi∣ly
imagin'd in so lamentable a Conjun∣cture,
how great a Mortification this
Disappointment was to Persons, who ho∣ped
to make their Fortune by so noble
an Enterprize. There was not one Ma∣riner
of the whole Squadron who did
not choose rather to perish with hun∣ger,
than to be diverted from the right
Course; And indeed they were already
accustom'd to eat Rats, and paid fifteen
Pence a-piece for them. Altho' we were
not so happy as to see those fortunate
Coasts of 
Peru,
 from whence we are
supply'd with what is generally esteem'd,
most precious; nevertheless I am apt to
believe, that a particular Account of
the Occasion of our Undertaking this
Voyage, may not be altogether unac∣ceptable
to the Reader.


In the Year 1686.
 certain Free-boot∣ers
of St. 
Domingo,
 who are well known
to be Enemies to Peace, after having
for many Years infested the Coast of

Carack, New-Spain,
 and 
Cuba,
 without
being able to get any considerable Prize,


took a Resolution to pass to those of
the Southern-Sea, which they know to
be much more Rich, and less fortify'd.
There were two Passages which lay o∣pen
into those Parts, 
viz.
 one along the
Coast, and the other by the Streight
of 
Magellan:
 The former, as the short∣est,
was taken by some other Rovers;
but there were two great Difficulties,
one of being attack'd by the 
Indians

during their Course, who have some∣times
War and sometimes Peace with
the 
Spaniards:
 And the other Difficulty
is to find in that Sea, Vessels conveni∣ent
for the performing of such a Voy∣age.
The Passage thro' the Streight of

Magellan
 appearing to these Free-booters
to be the safest,
 they set Sail, being 80
Men in number, for the Southern-Sea,
where they soon became formidable by
the frequent Descents they made in se∣veral
Places, and by the great number
of Ships richly laden, which they took:
However, notwithstanding these Prizes,
they made but little Booty, as well by
reason of the irregular Conduct of their
ill-disciplin'd Company, as in regard that
the Merchandizes were too combersome
to be manag'd by Persons who had no
settled place of Retreat: Therefore they


contented themselves only with putting
them to Ransome; and when they
could take a sufficient quantity of Pro∣visions
for five or six Months, they re∣tir'd
to some Island, where they spent
their time in Hunting and Fishing;
and after having consum'd their whole
Stock, they return'd to the Coast.


Thus our Free-booters liv'd wretched∣ly
for the space of seven Years,
 till
some of them, mov'd with a Desire to
return to their Native Country, took
a Resolution to sail back to the Nor∣thern
Sea, and to that purpose met to∣gether
in the Island 
Fernand,
 where
they divided their Booty, and every one
of them had the Summ of eight or
nine thousand Livres for his Share.
However twenty three of them having
lost by Gaming what they were so long
in getting, continu'd on that Island with
a
 
Pirogue,
 in which they cross'd over
to 
Peru,
 resolving either to perish, or
at least to repair their Losses. Some
time after, they took five rich Ships, a∣mong
which they chose that which they
judg'd to be most convenient for the
making an end of their Voyage: They
loaded it with cast Metal, divers 
Indian

Merchandizes and Provisions, and at last


would have return'd with a much rich∣er
Cargo than the others, if they had
not had the ill Fortune to lose their
Ship in the Streight of 
Magellan,

where they spent ten whole Months
in building a Bark, as well as they
could, and with all the Application
requisite in so great an Exigence:
They laded their Bark with what they
could save out of the Wreck of their
Ship, and pass'd 
Cayenna.


All the Free-Booters being come back
to the Northern Sea,
 thought fit to re∣tire
with their small Cargo; so that some
of them settled at 
Brasil,
 and others
went to 
Cayenna,
 St. 
Domingo,
 and the
other Islands of 
America;
 but there were
about four or five, who being unwilling
any longer to undergo the Hardships of
so mean a Condition, took a Resolution
to make a Second Voyage, and to that
purpose, they pass'd over into 
France,

with good Memoires concerning their
Adventures. One of them nam'd 
Ma∣certy,

made Application to Mousieur

de Gennes,
 whom he knew to be
a Man very fit for the Management of
great Undertakings, insomuch that the
latter approv'd his Design, and went to

Paris,
 to represent to the Court the Ad∣vantages
that might arise from such a


Voyage, proffering his Service to carry
on so noble an Enterprize.


The Proposals made by M. 
de Gennes

were receiv'd with all the approbation,
that could be wish'd for; the King sup∣ply'd
him with Ships at his own choice,
and the Project was so well approv'd of,
upon account of its Novelty, that divers
Persons of the highest Quality readily
contributed to the equipping of our Fleet.
A great number of Young Men, who
were equally excited by Curiosity to see
such fine Countries; and by the hopes
of getting an opportunity to make their
Fortune, earnestly desir'd to be admitted
into the Company: However it seems,
we did not go on successfully in all
Points, since our Design at last prov'd
abortive: But 'tis to be hop'd, that the
Court will not discourage an Underta∣king
of so great Importance, which fail∣ed
only by reason of the small Experi∣ence
we then had of the Season of the
Winds. 'Tis well known, that the 
Spa∣niards

are not in a Condition to make
War with us; that by the means of the
vast Treasures which they gather daily
out of 
New-Spain
 and 
Peru,
 they have
actually made themselves Masters of those
Countries, by spilling the Blood of a


vast multitude of poor 
Indians,
 who on∣ly
sought for an amicable Correspondence
with those haughty Invaders, who to
strike a greater Terror into their Minds,
gave it out, that they were descended of
the Gods. Besides all the Tortures which
they could devise for the destroying of
those miserable Wretches, they carried
on their Cruelty so far, as to assassinate
and sell them for the Slaughter, for the
Maintenance of their Attendants. And in∣deed,
there are many 
Frenchmen
 who can
testifie, that the Coasts of 
Peru
 are still co∣ver'd
with the Skeletons of those unfortu∣nate
Victims, whose Blood cries to Heaven
for Vengeance, and for the Liberty of
their native Country; insomuch that
nothing can prevent the Destruction of
those Enemies of God and Nature, who
under the Name of Christians, revive
Idolatry, and live in the midst of their
Treasure, in a Luxury that even sur∣passes
that of brute Beasts. I might
enlarge on this Subject, but that 'tis
more expedient to resume our former
Discourse, and to give a farther Account
of our Misfortunes.


On the 5th. Instant, the Winds be∣ing
still contrary, we prepar'd to re∣turn
to the Northern Sea, as it was


determin'd two Days before. But we
were scarce under sail, when the Winds
chang'd as it were on purpose to de∣ceive
us, and induc'd us to make another
Attempt, which was not only
fruitless, but wou'd have certainly pro∣ved
our Ruine, if we had not been ap∣parently
protected by Divine Providence
in a very extraordinary manner. We
had not made a League, when these
favourable Winds terminated in a great
Calm, and the Tides (the Course of
which we cou'd not discern from Cape

Froward
) drove us on the Coasts, in∣somuch
that four Shallops were not a∣ble
to get us clear of the Shore. We
let fall a large Anchor, which very
much abated the force of the Cur∣rent,
but could not hinder us from run∣ning
a-float, by reason that the bottom
not being firm, cou'd not hold it. We
might have leapt off from the Poop a∣shore,
and judg'd the Danger to be
unavoidable,
 when a gentle Breeze hap∣pily
blew fresh from the North, and
set us at Liberty; whereas if any other
Wind had arose, we had certainly pe∣rish'd.
In the mean while, the 
Sun of
Africa
 and the 
Glutton
 Frigate were very
near running the same Hazard.



We lay before the Cape during the
whole Night, and at break of Day, we
set sail again, but the Winds being con∣trary,
we were forc'd to spend the next
Night in the like manner, before Cape

Froward.


On the 7th.
 at break of Day, the
Winds blowing fresh again from the
North-East, we made our last Effort,
and doubl'd Cape 
Froward,
 but to no
purpose. However we did not forbear
to put out to Sea, and on the 11th.
at six a-clock in the Evening, having
pass'd between 
Terra de Fuogo
 and the
Shelves that lie at the Mouth of the
Streight, we re-enter'd the Northern Sea,
and steer'd our Course directly for 
La
Isla Grande.


On the 16th. at break of Day, we
were separated from the 
Sun of Africa

and the 
Seditious
 Frigat, by the means
of a great Fog, which hinder'd 'em from
hearing the Signals that we gave to tack
about.


On the 17th. and 18th. we had foul
Weather, and the Sea ran very high.


On the 26th. the Weather was very
foggy, and the Winds were so boiste∣rous,
that we were oblig'd to take
down the Mizzen-Mast: The Waves


swell'd extremely, and we were beset
on all sides as it were with Mountains
of foaming Billows; insomuch that in
the Evening we lost one of our Ma∣riners,
who fell into the Sea, as he
was coming down from the Top-Mast.


On the 27th. our Pilots sail'd a-cross
the River 
de la Plata,
 at the di∣stance
of 60 Leagues from the Land,
and on the 29th. we had a great deal of
foul Weather.


The Winds were very favourable to
us,
 till the 9th. of the next Month;
but we did not take a provident Care
to sail along the Coasts, which we
could not discover till within 20 Leagues
to the North of the Islands of St. 
Ann.


On the 12th. we cast Anchor in a
Road very full of Fish, where we
took a great quantity of fine ones,
and among others, divers Sea-Porcu∣pines,

so called, because they are a∣ctually
armed with sharp-pointed Bri∣stles,
as the Porcupine or Hedg-hog,
which they prick up when pursued by
other Fishes.


On the 13th. at nine a-clock in the
Evening, we made ready to set Sail;
but on the 14th. and 15th. the Winds
were very variable.






P. 88


A Sea Porcupine taken on the Coast of Brasil▪







On the 16th. we discover'd Cape

Frie,
 but were not able to double it,
because there was very little Wind
stirring. About eight a-clock in the
Evening, the Sky being very serene,
we discern'd the Moon to be in an
Eclipse, that continu'd almost for the
space of two Hours, and which in∣deed
was not foreseen by us, in re∣gard
that we did not meet with any
Almanacks in the Straight of 
Magel∣lan,

where the Inhabitants, although
great Star-gazers, do not reap the
Fruits of their Observations. About
two a-clock in the Morning, we de∣scry'd
a Vessel under the Wind, and
some gave it out that there were
two: Whereupon we prepar'd our Bat∣teries,
and kept the Weather-gage du∣ring
the whole Night. At break of
Day, we perceiv'd it to be a 
Portu∣guese

Bark, which a Storm had dri∣ven
from the Mouth of the River

Janëiro:
 The Mariners belonging to
this. Vessel inform'd us, that the Fleet
was arriv'd, and that the Governor was
chang'd, but that he heard no News
of our Ships. We freely bestow'd on
them two Barrels of Water, of which
they were destitute two Days, and were


not able to make Land, to take in any.


On the 19th. we doubl'd Cape 
Frie,

and on the 20th. we cast Anchor with∣in
seven Leagues of 
Rio-Janeiro;
 but
we had not so much as one blast of
Wind, and the Currents were contrary.
There we saw Two of those Pillars of
Water that arise out of the Sea, and
which are commonly call'd 
Spouts:

When they draw near, 'tis customary
to discharge several Cannon-shot, to di∣sperse
them, and by that means the dan∣ger
is often escap'd.


On the 21st. we put out to Sea,
and the next Day we cast Anchor,
within two Leagues of the Coast, be∣fore
the Mouth of the River, but we
determin'd not to enter it, by reason
that our Place of Meeting was appoint∣ed
to be at 
La Isla Grande.


On the 24th. we prepar'd to set Sail
again, when the Rocks cut our Cable,
and sav'd us the trouble of weighing
Anchor; and so little Wind was stir∣ring
in the Night, that at break of Day
we found our selves driven by the
Currents under Cape 
Frie,
 which made
us take a Resolution to stand in for
the Islands of St. 
Ann,
 to wait for a
fair Wind, as also to take in fresh Wa∣ter


and Provisions, of which we had a
very short Allowance. Thus we cast
Anchor on the 26th. Instant at Noon,
and found the Island as full of Fowl as
at our first Arrival.


On the 27th. we sent our Boat a∣shore
to take in Provisions, and to get
Information about our Vessels: We
purchas'd six Oxen, two Hoggs, and
some Pullets, but not without a great
deal of Difficulty, by reason that all the
Provisions were transported to 
Rio Ja∣neiro,

for the use of the Fleet: We
were also inform'd, that our Ships
had enter'd that River twenty Days
ago.


On the 29th. at five a-clock in the
Evening, we set Sail with a favourable
Wind, and order'd the Pink to carry
the Lanthorn: We follow'd her for
some time, but forasmuch as she sail'd
too near the Coast, and the Night was
dark, we left her to continue her Course,
and stood somewhat farther out to Sea.


On the 30th. at break of Day, we
weather'd Cape 
Frie,
 and found the
Winds and Currents contrary as be∣fore.
At the same time, we discern'd
the Pink four large Leagues to the
Windward of us; nevertheless (as


we were afterwards inform'd) she conti∣nu'd
at Sea eight Days longer, before
she could find means to enter the
River.


The rest of that Day, and the next,
we had but little Wind, and that too
was contrary; insomuch that after di∣vers
fruitless Attempts, Monsieur 
de
Gennes
 judg'd, that for the future we
ought not to be obstinately resolv'd
to pursue our intended Course, lest we
should be reduc'd to the greatest Ex∣tremity;
but that 'twas more expedi∣ent
to stand in for the Bay of 
All-Saints;

since by sailing thither, we
should get so far onward in our Way,
and we should certainly meet with
plenty of Provisions in that Place.


Therefore we cast Anchor 
June
 the
first,
 at Four a-clock in the Evening,
before the Islands of St. 
Ann,
 to get
some Recruits, having on board Vi∣ctuals
sufficient only to serve for eight
Days at most; and forasmuch as it was
requisite to give notice to our Vessels
of the Course that we had determin'd
to steer, we sent an Officer a-shore to
desire a Pass-port of the Commander of
the Town, to go to 
Rio-Janeiro
 by Land,
to acquaint them with our Design:


the Officer who had received Orders to
return the same Evening, not appearing
by next Day Noon; Monsieur 
de Gennes

believing some Misfortune had befallen
him, sent out a Shallop armed with
two small Guns, to get Intelligence,
which return'd to us again about Five
in the Evening: And the Men reported,
That they had seen the Canoe in the
River, where there were Dwelling-places;
and that the Officer who ap∣peared
on Shoar, came up to the point
of Land there, in Order to give them
Notice to return, because it was shal∣low
Water, and that he had passed over
a Ridge of Rocks where the Surge of
the Sea was very frightful; and that
this was the Reason, together with his
tarrying for three Beefs they were
in quest of for us, that detained our Ca∣noe
from returning to us.


The Shallop went back next Day,
about ten of the Clock, and as she was
ready to enter in, the Officer who had
sent her back the Day before, gave
them a Signal to come to an Anchor,
and to wait till the Tide came in. They
continued in that Posture till two a
Clock in the Afternoon; when the Of∣ficer
that commanded, grown quite


weary with staying, made use both of
his Sails and Oars, and put forwards;
and that in spight of the Advice of the
Master, and of all the Signals that
could be made from the Shoar to the
contrary: But he was no sooner incom∣moded
with the terrible Rocks afore∣mentioned,
than that he began to re∣pent
(tho' it was now too late) of his
Rashness. After they had bore divers
rude Attacks of the Sea, a Wave brought
all their Oars on one side, and this Wave
was followed by another, that opened the
Shallop in the very middle, and drown∣ed
the Commander,
 with seven Seamen
more; but the Master, together with
the Gunner and seven other Mariners,
saved themselves, and remained on
Shoar to seek out their Comrades Bo∣dies.


That same Evening our Canoe came
to inform us of this sorrowful News;
and withal, that it was impossible for
us to pass over the Territories of the

Portuguese
 to go to 
Rio-Janeiro,
 because
the Governour had given Orders at 
Cape
de Frie,
 to suffer no Stranger to pass that
way. She brought us three Beefs, some
Poultry, a Tyger-Cat, and another
very strange Animal, whom the 
Por∣tuguese

A CAPIVARD
or Water Hog

at the foot of a

Bananier.





call by the Name of 
Capivard:

he has a Body like a Hog, his Head is
of the shape of an Hares, and his Hair
thick and ash-coloured; he has no Tail
at all, but sits upon his Breech as an
Ape does; his Abode is mostly in the
Water, and goes not ashoar but in the
Night-time, when he ravages all the
Gardens round about, and roots up
Trees that he may come at the Fruit
of them.


On the 4th we sung Mass for the
dead, and discharged three Pieces of
Cannon for the Officer that had been
drowned, whose Name was 
Salior,
 born
at 
Paris,
 and a young Gentleman whose
Loss deserved to be regretted. This
being over, the Canoe was sent to shoar
again, to bring back those Seamen that
had the Luck to escape drowning; she
returned the same Day, and brought
along with her two Beefs more: The
Bodies of our drowned Friends could
not be found, and the 
Portuguese
 in∣forming
us that the Place where they
were lost were full of 
Requins,
 it's not
to be doubted but they were devoured
by them.


Next Day, which was the sixth,
about three in the Morning, we made


ready to sail for the Bay of 
All-Saints,

without giving Information of the same
to the other Vessels we had with us;
but seeing Monsieur 
de Gennes
 had spo∣ken
of it before at 
la Gloutonne,
 we had
some sort of reason to hope that they
would rejoin us, at least at 
Cayenne.


On the 7th and 8th we steer'd a
wide Course, that we might put by the

Abralhes,
 which are certain Islands and
heaps of Rocks that run out five and
forty Leagues into the Sea, and on
which divers Ships have perished. The

Portuguese,
 who are well acquainted
with them, make no great Difficulty
of sailing through the midst of them;
and so save a large Compass that others
are oblig'd to make, to avoid them.
We saw a great Whale the Day fol∣lowing,
that went round our Ship se∣veral
times, and twice under it.


We were on the 10th, 11th, and 12th.
troubled with excessive Heats, and had
but very little Wind; at what time
we catch'd a great Number of 
Requins,

which was a considerable help to leng∣then
out our Provisions: But tho' this
Fish appears to be firm Flesh enough,
yet it is so insipid that several of our
Men were injured with the eating of it.


It's thick, and five or six Foot long,
a great Lover of Man's Flesh, has a
large Mouth, and therein five rows of
very sharp Teeth: He turns himself
upon his back to catch his Prey, and
has two or three small Fishes near him
that are his Pilots, and never forsake
him, but serve to secure him from be∣ing
surprized by the Whale.


There is a sort of Fish which they
call 
Sucet,
 that is commonly fastened
to the 
Requin,
 and this has given many
Men occasion to believe that he is his
Pilot; but herein they are mistaken,
for this small Fish never closes with
the other, but when he finds himself
pursued; and then taking half a turn
round, he strikes the 
Requin
 over the
Head, and fixes himself so fast to the
other, that it's impossible for him
to make him let go his hold; inso∣much,
that this little Fish makes him∣self
to be convoyed with this pretty sort
of Guard whithersoever he pleases: On
the three following Days, 
viz.
 the 13th,
14th, and 15th, we were incommoded
with contrary Winds; but on the 17th
we kept about fifteen Leagues off of
the 
Abralhes
 and sailed on, and next Day
passed over the Shallows of St. 
Antony.



We made Land the 
Nineteenth,
 which
our Pilots computed at above thirty
Leagues distance; and this made us
judge, That the Sea Currents moved
to the North, as the 
Portuguese
 had
assured us, who take it for a Maxim,
that the Currents on the Coast of 
Bra∣sil

follow the Course of the Sun; that
when the same is in the Northern He∣misphere,
they run to the Northward,
but when in the Southern, to the
Southward. On the 
Nineteenth
 at
Night, having got within six Leagues
of Cape St. 
Antony,
 we brought to,
and by break of Day, we saw about
two Leagues to the Windward of us, a
Ship that steered the same Course as
we did; whereupon we slackned our
sail to let her come up, and believing
it might have been one of our own
Fleet, we gave her a Signal whereby to
know us, but she returned us no Answer,
and proved to be a 
Portuguese
 Ship, that
was making the best of her way for the
Bay of 
All-Saints
 as well as we: About
Noon we made the Cape of St. 
Antony,

and saw all along the Coast a great
Number of Barks, and the Negro's Pi∣peries,
as they are called, being no
other than three or four pieces of Wood


made fast together, whereon two Men
go out a fishing to the extent of two
Leagues: Some of them we boarded,
but we could never bring them to con∣duct
us to the Road, they alledging,
they were forbid to do it; but I be∣lieve
it was because they would not
leave their fishing.


But it fortunately happen'd, that we
descry'd two sorts of small Tartanes,
that were for making the best of their
way into the Bay as well as we; them
we waited for, and required them to
grant us a Pilot for our Money; upon
which, one of the Masters of these
Tartanes, offered himself to conduct us
to the Place where we were to An∣chor,
and this he performed with all
imaginable Civility: We drew up in
Order, within Cannon Shot of Cape
St. 
Antony,
 and about five in the Even∣ing
cast Anchor within a small League
of the Town, that we might not em∣barrass
our selves with the 
Portuguese

Fleet we found there, consisting of be∣tween
forty and fifty Sail, all laden
and ready every minute to sail away.


As soon as we were come to an An∣chor,
there came a Lieutenant from the
Admiral, to require us to salute him;


but Monsieur 
de Gennes
 made him an∣swer,
the King had given him Orders
not to salute any, without they received
Gun for Gun; and that he would send
his next Captain, to settle that Affair
with the Governour: The Lieutenant
hereupon, sent to see for his Shallop,
in order to assist us; and after a thou∣sand
tenders of his Service to us, he
accompanied the Chevalier 
de Fontenay

to wait upon the Governour, with
whom he had no long Dispute, for they
quickly agreed not to salute one ano∣ther
at all, which made most of the 
Por∣tuguese

to murmur, and concernedly to
say, That it was not to be endured,
that a 
Frenchman
 should pass under
their Forts without saluting them, and
yet not be called to an Account for it:
But 'tis well known, they are no other∣wise
brave than upon their own Dung∣hills;
and that they had rather, upon
Occasion, have Recourse to their Beads
than to their Courage.


The Morrow being 
The Feast of God,

Monsieur 
de Gennes,
 accompanied with
several other Officers, went to wait
upon the Governour and the Intendant,
who shew'd him abundance of Civilities:
The Governour's Name was 
Don John


de Lancastre,
 one of the Principal Men
of the Kingdom, and Vice-Roy of 
Bra∣sil:

Then they went to see the Pro∣cession
of the Holy Sacrament,
 which
is as remarkable in that Town, for the
vast Number of Crosses, Shrines, rich
Ornaments, armed Troops, Companies,
Fraternities, and Religious Orders; as
'tis ridiculous for the Masquerades, Mu∣sical
Instruments, and Dancers that at∣tend
thereat, and who by their wanton
Postures, invert the end of this Holy
Ceremony. The Procession was no soo∣ner
over, but our Gentlemen went to
hear Mass, to the Convent of the Re∣verend
Fathers the Jesuits; where they
were received by some Fathers of the

French
 Nation very kindly, who con∣firmed
unto them the Loss of 
Namur,

and the Hopes there were of a Peace
with 
Savoy;
 from them they went to
dine with the 
French
 Consul, and heard
a great deal more News there also.


We were also informed by a Friar
newly come from 
Goa,
 that before he had
left that Port, he had seen a 
French
 Ship
that put in there, after having fought
three 
Arabian
 Vessels, by whom she had
been very rudely handled. When these
mischievous Pirates board any Ship,


they do, in order to blind their Ene∣mies,
make use of a sort of wrought
Lime, which being squashed down up∣on
the Bridge they use upon that Occa∣sion,
has a most terrible Effect.


Here we came to know also of the
Loss of the Famous 
Montauban,
 of whom
the Free-booters made so much Noise
at 
Bourdeaux.
 He met with a large

English
 Ship on the Coast of 
Guinea,

whom he boarded, and took her by
main Force; but the 
English
 Comman∣der
being enraged that he should be ta∣ken
by a Free-booter, he set the Pow∣der
on fire, and blew up his own Ship
and that of 
Montauban
's; who with a
dozen or fifteen of his own Men, threw
himself into the Sea, where they floated
upon Masts for five Days and five
Nights, and at last got a-shoar half dead
in the King of the Negro's Coun∣try,
where they were kindly received,
upon the account of an old 
Portuguese

that Traded upon that Coast, and who
took Compassion on those miserable
Wretches: When they had been there
about five or six Months, a 
Dutch
 Ship
bound for 
Jamaica
 passed by that way,
which took 
Montauban
 and seven or
eight of his Followers, who promised


to pay for their Passage, on board him;
while the other six, who could not find
the same Favour at the 
Dutch
-man's
hands, got a Passage in a 
Portuguese

Flute, that carried Negro's to 
All-Saints

Bay, from whence we gave them free
Transportation to 
Martenico.


On the 4th of 
July,
 the Admiral
with divers Merchant Ships, anchored
in the Road; and on the 8th, the whole
Fleet made ready to sail away for 
Lis∣bon,

consisting in all of 45 Ships, laden
with Sugar, Tobacco, Cotton, Fish,
Oyl and Skins; they were almost all
of them mounted from twelve to thirty
six pieces of Cannon, but the Admiral
and Vice-Admiral that were Men of
War, and out upon the King's Account,
carried one of them sixty Guns, and
the other no less than seventy two.


We drew nearer to the City on the
9th, having hitherto taken in no Pro∣visions;
for the 
Portuguese
 Fleet had
made it excessive dear, but now we
bought some 
European
 Meal, Magniot,
and Rice; and the Intendant was so
civil, as to let us have the Use of the
King's Magazine, to provide Salt to sea∣son
our Provision with: And that we
might not be wanting in any thing to


our selves that was necessary; we began
also to build us a Shallop instead of that
which we had lost at St. 
Anne
's.


All-Saints
 may be reckoned for one of
the largest,
 finest, and most convenient
Bay of any other in the World, being
capable of containing no less than two
thousand Ships; of a very good Depth,
and no Winds to be feared there. They
take a great Number of Whales therein,
build very fine Ships, and they had one
then upon the Stocks that would carry
sixty pieces of Cannon.


As for the City of St. 
Salvador,
 that
is seated upon this Bay, it's large, well
built, and very populous; but the Scitua∣tion
of it is not so advantagious, as
could be wished. It's high and low,
and scarce one straight Street therein;
it's the Capital City of 
Brasil,
 an Ar∣chiepiscopal
See, and the Residence of
the Vice-Roy: This place is honoured
with a Soveraign Council, and the Pri∣vilege
to coin Money; where, in order
to quicken Trade, they make such sort
of Pieces as are current no-where else,
but in 
Brasil:
 They have on the one
side the Arms of 
Portugal,
 and a Cross
charged with a Spear on the other, with
this Inscription, 
SƲBQ. SIGN. STABO.



This City, to the Seaward, is de∣fended
with some Forts, and several
Batteries mounted with Cannon, and
to the Landward, with earthen Bastions
ill made. We saw them lay the Foun∣dation
of a Fortress, the Governour had
ordered to be erected about half a Can∣non
shot without the Town: The

Dutch
 attempted divers times to make
themselves Masters of this Place, but
without Success, tho' they have taken
away two and twenty Ships from
thence at one clap.


The Inhabitants, to say nothing of
the common People, who are insolent
to the highest Degree, are neat, civil,
and honest, and withal rich, being lo∣vers
of Trade, and for the most part
are of a Jewish Extract; and this is
the Reason, that when any one of the
Inhabitants is about to make one of his
Sons a Divine, he is obliged to prove
his Ancestors were Christians, as the
Knights of 
Malta
 are under an Obliga∣tion
of making out their Gentility, be∣fore
they enter into the Order. They
love Women extreamly, and spare no
Charges for the setting out of their
Wives, who in respect to all other
things, have Cause enough to complain;


for they are never allowed to see any
Body, and go not out of doors at any
other time but on 
Sunday
 early in the
Morning, to go to Church: They are
a very jealous People, and 'tis a kind
of a point of Honour for a Man to stab
his Wife, when he can convict her
of being unfaithful to his Bed; tho' for
all that, this cannot hinder many of
them from finding out a way to impart
some of their Favours to us 
Frenchmen,

whose winning and free Conversation
they are mightily in love with.


As the Town is nothing throughout
but up's and downs, and that conse∣quently
Carriages are very impractica∣ble
there; their Slaves are forced to
perform what Horses should otherwise
do, and carry the heaviest sort of Goods
from one place unto another: And 'tis
also for the same Reason, that a thing
they call a Palanquin is much in use
there; it's nothing else but a kind of
a Sedan, covered over with a little
embroidered Canopy, and carried by
two Negro's by the help of a long Pole,
whereunto it's fastned at both ends:
Persons of Quality are carried therein
to Church, to make their Visits, and
also into the Fields. The Houses are


high-built, and most of them of Free-stone
and Brick; their Churches are
very sumptuous, being finely gilt, full
of Silver-plate, Sculptures, and a vast
Number of the best Ornaments that are
to be met with: And as for the Cathe∣dral-Church
there, dedicated to the
Cross, the Lamps and Candlesticks are
so high, and massy withal, that two
Men can scarce carry them.


They have several sorts of Religious
Orders amongst them; as 
Franciscans,
Carmelites, Benedictines, Jesuits,
 and
divers others, and all of them, except
a little Convent of 
French
 and 
Italian
Capuchins,
 are very rich; and more
particularly, the 
Jesuits
 are very potent
there, they being no less than 190 in
Number, their House of a vast Extent,
and their Church large and well beau∣tified:
Their Vestry is one of the most
Magnificent that ever was seen, it's
about an hundred and fifty Foot long,
and of proportionable Breadth: They
have three Altars in it, two whereof are
placed at the two ends, and the third
in the midst of that part that joins to
the Church; and upon which may be
seen, every Morning, above twenty
Calices, all of them made of Gold, Ver∣million,


and Silver; on each side of this
last Altar stand two great Tables, that
are of that length, that there is room
only left for two doors to open, by which
they enter into the Church. These two
Tables are made of very fine Wood,
the whole Surface of them being ador∣ned
with Ivory, a sort of Net-work,
and a great many fine Water-colour
Paintings, that are brought thither
from 
Rome.
 The fourth side of this
Vestry, that stands to the Seaward, is
pierced with divers large Crosses from
top to bottom, and the Ceiling very
curiously painted.


The Soyl here is flat or level, wa∣tered
with fine Rivers, on which the 
Por∣tuguese

inhabit for above fifty Leagues
into the Country, whose Dominion the

Indians
 shun, and for that end retire into
the Woods; but they steal their Cattle
continually, and eat them themselves
when they can catch them: Our 
Capu∣chins,

who (as we have already obser∣ved)
have a Convent in this City, have
travelled four or five Years among these
poor People, and expos'd themselves
with an Apostolical Zeal, to all sorts of
Fatigues, in order to reduce them from
their Blindness and Ignorance.



The Earth produces Sugar-Canes, To∣bacco,
Cotton, Magniot-Roots, Rice,
Maes, and such good Pasturage, that
they breed so great a Number of Cattle,
that Meat is sold there under a Penny
a Pound; but the Country is so pestered
with Ants, that they are constrained,
for the preserving of their Fields of
Maes and Magniot, to carry them to
feed upon the Roads: And those who
are curious in Gardening, must, by the
help of several small Channels, form an
Island of every Bed, to drown the Ants
in their Passage over. They have Pulse
and Fruits there in abundance, such as
they call the 
Banane, Ananas, Patatoes,
Ighname, Cocoe,
 and 
Goyave,
 of which
we have given a Description already.


Here they have also Cinamon, Pep∣per,
Ginger, the Oyl of 
Capahu,
 Balsom,
and several sorts of Roots that have a
wonderful Effect; and amongst the rest,
those called 
Para-ayra-braba,
 and 
Hypo∣pecovana.

The Cinnamon-tree is about
the Height of a small Cherry-tree,
bearing long Leaves, and pointed at the
end, of a bright green Colour; the 
Je∣suits

were the first that brought them
thither out of 
Ceylan,
 of which they
took great Care: But in some Years


they grew very common, because that
the Birds who eat the Fruit thereof,
sow the Seed up and down every-where,
being not able to digest it. The Plant
which bears the Pepper, clings round
about to other Trees like Ivy, has pret∣ty
large Leaves, pointed at the ends,
and of a deep green; and the Fruit it
produces are small Grapes, like those
growing on the wild Vine.


The 
Capahu-Oyle
 and the Balsom,
come from the Jurisdiction of 
Spiritu
Sancto;
 those they draw from certain
Trees, where the wild Beasts by rub∣ing
against their Bark, cure themselves
of their Wounds; for let them take off
never so little of them, these Liquors
will gush out, and have so much the
more admirable Effect, in that they are
not adulterated, as those we have in

Europe
 are. The 
Para-ayra-braba,
 is a
thick hard Root, which is made use
of as an infallible Remedy against all
sorts of Poysons: And as for the 
Hypo∣pecovana

it's a small Root, that in our
Armies has sufficiently discovered the
Vertues of it against the Bloody-flux,
being valued at ten Pistoles a Pound;
but now it's cheaper, as being more
common.



Among those that are curious, you
shall find very large Oranges, that ori∣ginally
were brought from the 
Mogul

Country; according to which they have
their Names, and some whereof are
eight Inches Diameter. They have a
sort of Roses growing amongst them,
whose Leaves are very like unto those
of 
Guimauva,
 and the Fruit whereof is
very singular, being white from Mid∣night
till Noon, and from Noon to
Mid-night again of a red Colour.


They have abundance of wild Fowl
in that Country, and a great Number
of extraordinary Birds, and more espe∣cially
the finest Parrots in the World;
to which may be added Tygers, Deer,
wild Boars, and several other Animals
that are unknown to us in 
Europe:

Monsieur 
de Gennes
 was presented with
a very large Tortoise, that lived with∣out
eating and drinking the rest of the
Summer, under one of the Carriages
of our Cannon; and these are a sort
of Animals that will never die till all
their Fat is entirely consumed.


We observed two sorts of Monkeys
there, which they distinguished by the
Names of 
Sagovins
 and 
Macaques;
 the
former are about the Bigness of a Squir∣rel,


some of them being of a greyish
Colour, but others have a fine Coat,
and of a Golden Hue; they are always
very merry and lightsome, but so ten∣der
that the least Cold kills them:
The 
Macaques
 are larger, and of a
brown Colour, weep continually, and
are no otherwise diverting, but that
they will imitate every thing they see
you do; and we had one of them that
would make some of our Ship-tackle as
well as the Seamen themselves.


The 
Portuguese
 have already found
some Silver Mines there, and lately
Amethists also; they have Brass enough
from the Coast of 
Angola,
 from the
Traffick they drive there, upon the
account of the Negro's. But to return,
on the 17th of 
July
 came in a 
Portu∣guese

Ship, belonging to the 
Guinea-Company,

lately erected amongst them,
which carried a white Flag with a Si∣nople
or green Cross in it, and next
Day our three Ships, which we did
not expect to see till we came to 
Ca∣yenne,

joined us; the 
Sun
 of 
Africa

gave us seven Guns, and we returned
her as many; the 
Seditious
 had lost her
Fore-round-top, and by them we were
informed that a Fleet of eighteen Sail


were put out of 
Rio-Janeiro;
 that the

Felicity
 had gone thither, that fifteen
Men had deserted them, and that Mon∣sieur

de la Roque
 had two of his Men
killed and an Officer wounded, in a
Descent they had made against the 
Por∣tuguese,

who detained five or six of our
Officers in Prison, upon account of a
Quarrel that happened, wherein two of
the Inhabitants were left dead upon
the spot.


On the 22d we heard the good 
Ca∣puchin

Father 
Francis
 preach; this Man
had spent five and twenty Years in
preaching to the 
Indians,
 and told Mon∣sieur

de Gennes,
 That he had several
times asked Leave of the General of
his Order, to return for some time into

Europe,
 but that he had desired him to
continue where he was, and not to for∣sake
that Work he had so happily en∣tered
upon; And that so taking the
Desires of his Superiour, as a Com∣mand
from him, he said he was ready
to re-enter upon his Mission, and had
no farther Thoughts of his Native
Country.


Having, by the sixth of 
August,
 ta∣ken
in our Stores of Water and Wood,
and laid in Provision for six Months,


we prepared for our Departure, and
found the Governour very civil, who
made a Present to all the Captains of
some 
Amethists,
 and of all sorts of Re∣freshments;
and the seventh Day be∣ing
come, we sailed away, and having
doubled the Cape of St. 
Antony,
 we
kept our Course out at Sea for some
Days, that we might shun the Coast,
which, by reason of the Banks of Rocks,
as well as the Storms that are frequent
there, is very dangerous.


On the 8
th
 we descry'd two Barks,
that made all the sail they could to
come up with us, and we staid for
them, as believing they were about to
bring us some News, because there was
a Ship put in there the Day before.
But they proved to be Negro's, who
came to desire us to take them away
with us, or else they would commit
themselves to the mercy of the Waves,
sooner than they would return again
under the Tyranny of their Masters;
but we sent them back, that we might
not give the 
Portuguese
 Occasion to com∣plain
of us, that we had taken away
their Slaves:
 And in truth, these sort
of Wretches are in a very miserable
State; they are born Slaves, and they


are scarce able to lift up their hands to
their heads, but they make them work
at tilling the Ground as Oxen do: Be∣sides
they are ill-fed, and bastinado'd
for the least Fault: They behold their
Children sold before their Faces, and
sometimes their Wives: And this does
affect the greatest part of those who
have been bred up in the Christian Re∣ligion,
to that Degree, that they run
away from their Masters, and chuse
rather to go and die in the Woods
among the 
Indians,
 where they meet
with greater Humanity than with the
other: But this they must execute with
the greatest Precaution, for if their
Masters once catch them, they give
them no Quarter; for they hang a great
Iron Collar about their Necks on each
side whereof there are Hooks, whereunto
is fastened a Stake or Branch of a
Tree, with which they thrash them at
Pleasure; and this they repeat so often,
that they put them almost out of Con∣dition
to follow their Work: But if it
so happen, that after this sort of Cha∣stisement
they relapse again into the
same Fault, they without any more
ado, cut off one of their Legs, nay,
and sometimes hang them for an Ex∣ample


of Terrour unto others; and tho'
all this is bad enough, yet the 
Spani∣ards

and the 
English
 treat them still in a
more cruel manner.


I knew one living in 
Martinico,
 who
being of a compassionate Nature, could
not find in his heart to cut off his
Slave's Leg, who had run away four
or five times, but to the end he might
not again run the risque of losing him
altogether, he bethought himself of
fastening a Chain to his Neck, which
trailing down backwards, catches up
his Leg behind, as may be seen by the
Cut: And this, in the space of two or
three Years, does so contract the Nerves,
that it will be impossible for this Slave
to make use of his Leg. And thus,
without running the Hazard of this
unhappy Wretch's Death, and without
doing him any Mischief, he thereby
deprived him of the means to make
his Escape.


On the 17th about seven in the Mor∣ning,
we had a sight of Cape St. 
Au∣gustine,

which we made at above thirty
Leagues distance, which gave us Occa∣sion
to believe that there were great
Currents that way, that run towards
the Coast: On the 22d about six in the





P 120

Evening we past the Line,
 with a
fresh Gale of Wind, that was very ne∣cessary
to dispel those excessive Heats
that are usually to be met with there,
and here we found great Currents bear∣ing
to the Westward; we kept still out
at Sea, that we might come to the height
of Cape 
Orange,
 and every Morning we
sent out the 
Sun
 of 
Africa
 and the 
Seditious

upon the Scout, by reason of the In∣formation
we had receiv'd from a 
Por∣tuguese

Ship, lately come from the Coast
of 
Guinea,
 That two 
Dutch
 Ships were
to sail away from thence in 
July,
 for

Barbicha
 and 
Surinam,
 laden with Gold∣dust,
and seven or eight hundred Ne∣gro's.
They are oblig'd, after they
have past the Line, to make the Cape
of 
Orange,
 and to follow the Coast with
the Current, and if they would have
passed that way, we should have infal∣libly
met with them.


On the 27th by break of Day, as our
Pilots allow'd us to be yet above sixty
Leagues from the Shoar, we observ'd
the Water to be of a yellowish Colour,
and muddy; and those of the Com∣pany,
who were so curious as to taste
them, told us, they did not want much
of being sweet; and this made us be∣lieve


that we were come to the Mouth
of the famous River of the 
Amazons,

that is so rapid as to preserve the Sweet∣ness
of its Waters for near twenty
Leagues within the Sea; we ran upon
the Coast till three in the Afternoon,
when we discovered a flat, even, and
woody Coast, where we anchored a∣bout
six in the Evening; and on the
28th and 29th, we followed the said
Coast, at three or four Leagues distance
from the Shoar, and never found above
five or six Fathom Water.


On the 30th,
 about seven in the Mor∣ning,
we descry'd the Cape of 
Orange,

where we began to see the Foot of the
Mountains: About three in the After∣noon,
we doubled a great Rock called
the 
Constable,
 three Leagues out in the
Sea, and five from 
Cayenne;
 we drew up,
at about half a Cannon shot's distance,
and about six in the Evening came to
an Anchor, three Leagues to the North
of 
Cayenne
 before five little Islands ly∣ing
near to that place. When next Day
was come, Monsieur 
de Gennes
 sent an
Officer to complement the Governour,
and to desire him to send us a Pilot to
conduct us to a sase Anchorage; but
our Arrival had already allarm'd the


whole Island, and they fired off their
Cannon all Night long, to give the In∣habitants
Notice to come together; and
they would not trust to our Colours,
because the 
Dutch
 in their Passage to

Surinam
 and 
Barbicha,
 have often cast
Anchor within a League of the Town,
under white Colours; and as they had
not been used to see four 
French
 Ships
at one time, they were apprehensive of
some Design upon them.


Our Shallop could not return before
next Day,
 which happened to be the
first of 
September,
 the same being oblig'd
to take a Course round the Island, for
avoiding the Currents, which are very
violent on that Coast; but she brought
a Pilot along, tho' the Sea was so shal∣low
that we were forced to tarry where
we were till the Day following: And
then on the second and third, we made as
much use of the Tide as possibly we could,
in order to get in, because there was so
very little Water, and that we could not
make ready before it had half flowed:
But about four in the Evening, we cast
Anchor under the Cannon of the Town,
within Pistol-shot of Land; there were
two Merchants Ships already in 
Cayenne,

that had waited seven or eight Months


for their Cargo, besides another Vessel
that came in the Day before us, laden
with Wine and Brandy. As our Men
had, just about this time, received a
Month's Pay, and that it was now a
long time since they had met with so
good an Opportunity, they not only
drank up the Ship's whole Cargo in
eight Days time, but also all the Wine
they had in the Island.


Cayenne
 is a 
French
 Island,
 scituated on
the Coast of 
Guiana,
 four Degrees and
forty five Minutes North Latitude, and
332 Longitude; it's formed by the
two Arms of a River, and may be rec∣koned
to be about eighteen Leagues in
Circumference; it stands high, upon
the Brink of the Sea, and is so marshy
in the middle, that you cannot travel
by Land, from one end to the other;
the Fens of it are covered with a sort
of large Trees called 
Mangles,
 which
above all other, have the peculiar Qua∣lity
of growing in Sea-Water; these
Trees are so thick, and their Roots for
the most part springing out of the Earth,
rise up, and are so well interlaced one
with another, that in some places a
Man may walk upon them above fif∣teen
or twenty Leagues together, with∣out


setting his Foot upon the Ground;
amongst them also divers 
Indians
 retire
with their Canoes, and there they make
their Carbets.


The Town stands on the West-part
of the Island, and is very advantage∣ously
scituated, Nature and Art having
both equally contributed to the forti∣fying
of it: It's of an irregular Hexa∣gone-Figure, has near sixty pieces of
Cannon planted upon Batteries, for the
Security of it; and on the Sea-side, up∣on
an Eminence, there is a Fort built
that commands every way: The Gar∣rison
of the place consists of two Hun∣dred
Regular Troops, but there are
above four Hundred Inhabitants living
either upon, or round about the Island,
that upon the least Alarm are oblig'd
to stand to their Arms. Monsieur 
de
Feroles,
 the Governour, is a Person that
has great Insight into the Affairs of a
Colony; the Power of distributing Ju∣stice
is vested in him, and he is much
beloved by the Inhabitants: The 
Je∣suits

have a Church in the Town, and
a Chappel at the other end of the
Island, for the Conveniency of those
that live remote.



This Island was formerly very un∣healthy,
as well for the continual Rains
that fell there, for nine Months in the
Year, as because the Ground was co∣vered
with Wood, and withal very
marshy; Diseases were very rife a∣mongst
them, and Infants usually died
almost as soon as they were born; but
since the Island has been grubbed up,
they have begun to grow more healthy,
the Women have good Lyings-in, and
their Children are lusty.


The chief Commodity of the Coun∣try,

is Sugar and 
Rocou,
 but they make
no great Quantity, because the Inhabi∣tants
want Slaves to work for them,
and that is the Reason that Ships wait
sometimes for near a Year's time for
their lading: Those Negro's which we
had sent thither by the Ship called the

Fertill,
 were almost all dead before they
got to the Place; for being taken with
a Calm, they wanted both Water and
Victuals: But we having still about
forty on board, we sold them for five
hundred Livres a Man. The Commo∣dities
they have from 
France,
 are Wine,
Brandy, Meal, and powdered Meats;
for Beefs are very rare to be found
there, besides they are not allowed to


kill any of them without Leave, as be∣ing
desirous to let them multiply.


They carry Iron Tools, and small
Wares also thither, for to traffick with
the 
Indians:
 Four or five Years since,
Money was very scarce amongst them;
but the Free-booters who returned from
the Southern-Seas, and the meanest of
which had at least two or three thou∣sand
Crowns for his Share, bought
them Habitations here, increased the
Colony, and thereby made Money cur∣rent
amongst them. They drive a con∣siderable
Trade in Slaves, dry'd Fish,
and 
Amacks,
 with the 
Indians
 living upon
the River of the 
Amazons,
 and by this
Commerce the Colony is very much
enriched; but the 
Portuguese,
 who for
some Years past have a mind to settle
there, have massacred in a most cruel
manner those Persons who before went
thither unmolested, and in all manner
of Security. Monsieur 
de Feroles
 hath
begun a Road which is to go by Land
to this River,
 and pretends he'll drive
the 
Portuguese
 from thence. The same
belongs to 
France,
 and 'tis our Interest
to preserve it, not only upon the ac∣count
of our Traffick, but also because
there are Silver Mines there.



The Earth, besides Sugar and 
Rocou;

produces Cotton and Indigo, and is
withal very fertil in Maes and Mag∣niot;
besides those Fruits we have seen
in 
Brasil,
 we find growing here,
 the

Cassia, Papaye, Acajou-Apples,
 the 
Vanilla,
Peet,
 and several others. As for the

Papaye,
 it's a thick Fruit, and tastes some∣what
like a Cucumber; it grows round
the stem of a tall but tender Tree
that has large Leaves, and cleft as your
Vine Leaves are; the Tree it self is hol∣low,
and grows above fifteen Foot in
one Year's time.


The 
Acajou-Apple
 is thick, long, and
of a yellow-red; has a sharp Taste,
and is usually eaten baked. At the
end of this Apple you have a little green
Nut, that tastes like a Filbert, and in
form resembles a Sheeps-kidney: This
Fruit grows upon a tall and round sort
of a Tree, like unto a Chesnut-tree,
whose Leaves are of the same Form
and Colour, as those of the Laurel: The
Wood of it is very fine, and proper to
make Houshold Furniture of, and 
Piro∣gues

of forty and fifty Foot long; if a
Line, or such a thing, be once spotted
with the Juice of this 
Acajou-Apple,

it's impossible to take away the Stain,


till the Season of the Fruit be entirely
gone.


The 
Vanilla
 is a Plant that creeps up
along other Trees, in the same manner as
Ivy does; its Leaves being of a bright
green Colour, thick, long, strait, and
pointed at the ends. About seven Years
after it is planted, it begins to hear a
sort of Husks that are full of an oyly
Matter, and Seed that is smaller than
that of Poppy, which they make use
of in that Country, to give a good
Scent to Tobacco, and Liquors they
have amongst them.


The 
Peet
 is an Herb that can be
peeled in the same manner, as Hemp
with us, and whose threads are stronger
and finer than Silk, the Use whereof it
would have long since put out of doors,
if so be it would have been allowed to
be transported to 
France. Ebony,
 of
a different sort, 
Letter-wood
 (as they
call it) and that of 
Violet,
 with several
others, are very common in that Coun∣try.
To say nothing of the Fish and
Fowl that we find there in great abun∣dance,
as we do also Tygers, Deer,
Pigs, little Porcupines, Camelions,
those Beasts they call 
Agontills
 and 
Sa∣paions,

and divers sorts of Animals more.



As for the 
Agontill,
 it's a Creature of
the same Bigness with an Hare, of a
reddish Colour like unto a Deer, sharp
Muzzle, small Ears, and short as well
as very small Legs; but the 
Sapaion
 is
a kind of a little Monkey, of a yellow∣ish
Colour, having large Eyes, a white
Face and black Chin: It's of a low
Stature, but of a lively and caressing
Nature.


The Camelion doth somewhat resem∣ble
those small Lizards that creep up
our Walls, whose Colour cannot be
agreed on, because they receive it from
every thing they touch: They have
here also very large Serpents, but not
very venomous, and some of them have
been observed to have swallowed a
whole Deer at a time.


As for Birds,
 they have very curious
Parrots in that Country, that will quick∣ly
learn to speak; from which the 
In∣dians

pluck Feathers of divers Colours,
by the help of the Blood of certain creep∣ing
Animals, with which they rub them.
They have also other Birds, called 
Fla∣mands,
Ocos, Toucans,
 and many sorts
besides. The first whereof, 
viz.
 the

Flamands
 are Sea-birds, about the Big∣ness
of an Hen, which flie in Bands as


Ducks, or rather Cranes do; and whose
Feathers being of a scarlet Colour, the

Indians
 make unto themselves Crowns
of them: The 
Ocos
 are as big as the

Indian
 Poultry, black on the Back, but
white breasted, with a short yellow
Bill, a fierce Gate, and have small friz∣led
Feathers standing up like a Cop up∣on
their Heads. And for the 
Toucan,

that is a Bird that hath both black, red,
and yellow Feathers, being very near
as big as a Pidgeon, whose Bill is
almost as thick as his Body, and of a
very singular make, as being all over
nothing but black and white welts or
streaks, like 
Ebony
 and 
Ivory
 interlaid;
neither is his Tongue less admirable,
being nought but a plain Feather, and
that very streight.


We shall say nothing of several Birds,
who have nothing remarkable in them
besides their Feathers; and therefore,
we shall now proceed to a short De∣scription
of the Government of 
Cayenne,

which some, by reason of the Bigness of
it, and its Scituation under the Equa∣tor,
have called Equinoxial 
France.


The Government of 
Cayenne
 contains
about an hundred Leagues in length,

upon the Ocean, wherewith it's bounded


both on the East and North; as it has
to the West the River 
Marony,
 which
separates the same from 
Surinam,
 now
in the hands of the States of 
Holland;

and to the South, the Northern Boun∣dary
of the 
Amazons,
 where the 
Portu∣guese

have already built three Forts up∣on
the Rivers of 
Paron
 and 
Macaba:

One may see by the Map made of this
Government (which I have taken Care
to correct, according to the Memoirs
of Monsieur 
de Feroles,
 for to send it to
Court) the Road that has been made,
in order to drive them from thence:
This Road begins at the River of 
Pei∣ra,

which falls into that of 
Paron,
 and
by which they can afterwards go down
in Canoes: Here also Observations may
be made of the different Nations of the

Indians
 that dwell in those Parts, and
who all of them, tho' intermixt one
with another, speak different Langua∣ges,
and are almost always ingaged in
War, which is not usually put an end
to, until they make forty or fifty of
their Enemies Prisoners. We were in∣formed
by the 
Jesuits,
 That several of
these Nations were once entred into a
League against one another; and that
they were about a Year's Space in ma∣king


grand Preparation for War, which
after all ended one Night, in their surpri∣zing
two or three 
Carbets,
 where they
might burn perhaps about an hundred
Persons, Men, Women and Children, and
so returned home as fierce and vaunt∣ing,
as if they had made a Conquest of
the whole Country.


These 
Indians
 are red,
 of short Sta∣ture,
having black, long, and lank Hair;
they go all naked, unless it be their
Privy-parts, which they cover with a
little Cotton-welt, that hangs down by
their Legs: But for the Women, they
use a piece of Cloth half a Foot square,
which they call 
Camisa,
 and which is
usually woven after a striped manner,
of divers Colours, and especially white,
which they prefer above any other;
but some of them there are, who only
hang a Carrot-leaf at their Girdle: The
Men cut off their Beards, dye their Faces
with 
Rocou,
 and cover their Arms and
Faces with several folds of the fore∣mentioned
sort of Cloth; they gene∣rally,
by way of Ornament, wear
Crowns made of Feathers of various
Colours, and bore a hole between their
Nostrils, where they hang a little piece
of Money, or a large knob of green


Crystal that is brought from the Ri∣ver
of 
Amazons,
 and which they migh∣tily
value: But there is particularly one
whole Nation of these 
Indians,
 that
make a large hole in the nether Lip,
through which they put a piece of
Wood, whereunto they fasten this
Crystal: And as these are thus singu∣lar,
all the other Nations have particu∣lar
marks of Distinction also.


These People are very skilful in Bows
and Arrows, which they make use of
as well in fishing as fowling: They
work their 
Amacks
 very curiously, and
make very pretty Pots and Baskets,
which they call 
Pagara,
 and are wrought
in such a manner, that they go one into
another, and cannot be penetrated by
Water: They also make use of their

Couis
 or 
Calabasses,
 about which they
turn their Ornaments, and varnish them
with divers Colours, so as that the Wa∣ters
shall not injure them; but for all
this Skill of theirs, they are very lazy,
and continually lain down, taking no
Care for the Morrow, no, not for their
necessary Subsistence: And there is no∣thing
but Famine that can draw them
out of their 
Amacks.
 When they are in
the Country, or waging War, and


chance to hear that the Wife lies in,
they return with all speed, bind up their
Heads, and, as if themselves were in
labour, they lie in their Beds, where
their Neighbours come to comfort them
under their imaginary Illness: There
are several of them live together in
one or more large Cottages, which they
call 
Carbets,
 over each of which there
is a Captain constituted. As for their
Diet, they feed upon that which they
call 
Cassave, Maes,
 Fish and Fruits;
the Men they live by fishing, and 'tis
the Women that till the Ground: They
earry but a small matter of Victuals
along with them, when they go to
War; for they feast upon the fattest
part of their Prisoners Flesh, and for
the rest they sell them to the 
French.


They have divers sorts of Feasts
amongst them, unto which one 
Carbet

invites another; and there they appear
with Crowns on their Heads, and Fea∣ther-girdles,
and spend the Day in
dancing round, and in feasting, where
they make themselves drunk with a
strong sort of Liquor, which they call

Ovicon,
 made of 
Cassave
 and Fruit,
boyled together.



These poor People live in miserable
Ignorance, for they worship the Stars,
and are very much afraid of the Devil,
which they call 
Piaye,
 and who (as
they say) comes to Beat and Torment
them: Every one of them hath his
Wife, which they cannot forsake, 'tho
they find them Tardy: Old Men they
highly venerate, and when any of them
die, they bury them in their 
Carbets,

without any other Ceremony than to
make themselves soundly drunk: But
as soon as they think the Corps is al∣most
rotten, they dig up the bones, and
burning the same to ashes, they put
it into their 
Ovicon,
 and this they
esteem excellent chear; the 
Jesuits
 take
a deal of Pains in Instructing these poor
People, who with much Docility give
ear to the Mysteries of the Christi∣an
Faith.


On the 16th a Fire broke out in the
House of one of the Officers, which was
a great loss not only to the Owners, but
also to several of the Inhabitants round
the Town, who had their Moveables
there. All these Houses are built of
Wood, and thatched over, which is the
reason that Fire takes them so fast that
nothing can be saved.



On the 25th we made ready for a
cruise upon the Coast of 
Barbadoes,
 which
Island is under the Dominion of the

English,
 who send thither above six
hundred Ships every Year: It's well
Peopled, and they reckon no less than
six thousand Negro-Slaves to be in it,
so that without Contradiction it may
be esteemed the most Powerful Colony
of all the 
American
 Islands.


Monsieur 
de Gennes
 had some thoughts
of going to attack 
Surinam,
 and for
furthering of his design, Monsieur 
de
Feroles
 made him an offer to go thi∣ther
in Person with part of his Gar∣rison;
but certain 
Indians
 who do no∣thing
else but go backwards and for∣wards
to give an Account of what is
done both on the one and the other
side, informed us there were two large

Dutch
 Ships there carrying 70 Pieces
of Cannon, that were ready to put out
forthwith, and that so we should have
to deal with the Fort and these two Ships
at a time; which made us alter our re∣solution,
and to continue Cruising.


On the 14th of 
October,
 believing
our selves to be in the height of 
Bar∣badoes,

we sent the 
Glutton
 to 
Martinico,

with Orders to lade her self with Su∣gar,
and so to sail away for 
France:



And there we Cruised to the 16th,
fifty, forty, and thirty Leagues distance
from the Shoar, without seeing any
thing, and therefore we thought it
advisable to draw near to the Island.


The 17th the Weather was very
Hazy till five in the Afternoon, when
clearing up all of a sudden, we disco∣vered

Barbadoes,
 from which we might
be about five Leagues distance: About
an Hour after we descryed a Ship; But as
we found she was near the Shoar, and
that it was now Night, we thought
it more Convenient to bear off than to
come up with her.


On the 18th the Wind being very
slack, we found our selves still to be at
the same distance from Shoar, but a∣bout
Noon we gave chase under 
Eng∣lish

Colours to a Carvet that came to
discover what we were, but upon her
putting up 
French
 Colours, and giving
us a Gun as a Signal that she was
really such, we hung out ours also, and
gave her the same assurance. This was
a small Vessel from 
Martinico
 called
the 
Malovin,
 carrying four Guns, and
was manned with five and forty Buc∣caneers,
whose Captain came on board
us, and gave us an Account of the


Death of Monsieur 
de Blenac,
 General
of the 
American
 Islands, adding farther
that he had met with our Fleet, and
that there were six and twenty Sail
of Ships got into 
Barbadoes
 about six
Weeks before.


About five in the Evening we dis∣covered
three Ships near the Shoar,
which the 
Malovin
 told us was a Man
of War for a Guard-ship, that carried
four and fifty Guns, and two small
Frigates of fourteen Guns each, and
that they were come out to hinder
her to take a Merchant Ship, that she
had chased to the very mouth of the
Port.


On the 19th by Break of Day we
discovered the said Guard-ship followed
by a Skiff about two Leagues off of us:
But as there was but very little Wind
stirring, and that she had a great mind
to know what we were, she made use
of her Oars to get out, and about three
in the Afternoon sent her Shallop to
see what the 
Seditious
 was, which was
not above two Cannon-shot off, but a∣bout
five she recalled her, and an Hour
after she sailed off and made a show of
getting to the Shoar and recovering
land: But we did not think fit to pursue


her, because we were apprehensive she
might return, and had a design to
surprize us: But in short we saw her
again at ten at Night within Cannon-shot
of us, and she followed us all that
Night long almost within Musket-shot,
and from time to time fired Rockets as
a Signal for the Shallop to come up, that
had not yet rejoyned her. At break of
Day we came up to her with a good
Wind under 
French
 Colours, and all
our sails loose, but as she had no other
design than to see what we were, and
not to fight, she gave us no Occasion
to desire her to return to Port, which
she did very safely, as did also the Skiff
and her Shallop, which we discharged
some shot at.


On the 20th and 21th we bore off to
Sea, and next Day about Noon discover∣ed
a Ship, about three Leagues to
the Windward of us, with which we
came very near up, when the Night
approached and prevented our taking of
her.


On the 24th we took a small Fly-boat
of forty Tunn,
 coming from 
Virginia,

laden with Tobacco, Bacon, and Meal
for 
Barbadoes,
 and was valued at 10000
Livres; and the 
Seditious
 the very same


Day gave chase to another small Ship,
that made her escape by the favour of
the Night.


The 25th and 26th we had a great
deal of bad Weather, on the last of
which, about three in the Afternoon
we saw a large Ship two Leagues to
the Windward of us, towards which
we bare, and all that Night kept a diffe∣rent
Course that we might not lose
her, but all in vain.


On the 28th we found our selves in
sight of 
Barbadoes,
 from which we com∣puted
our selves to be five and twenty
Leagues distance; we were surprized
with our mistake, and could attribute
the cause of it to nothing but the
Currents; but we took this opportunity
to send our Fly-boat to 
Martinico,
 to∣wards
which she made good sail by the
help of the Night, and a favourable
Wind.


We spent the rest of our time to the
fourth of 
November,
 to get thirty or forty
Leagues out to Sea, because the Winds
are always contrary, and that no way
can be made but upon a tack; and on
the sixth, seventh, and eighth we had
very bad weather, and next Day we
were ready to sail back, when we dis∣covered


a Ship two Leagues off to the
See-ward,
 which as well as we, was
at the Cape, to stay for the weather to
prove better; hereupon we made all the
sail we could, and in two Hours time
came within Cannon-shot of her; she put
out 
English
 Colours, which we Answered
with ours, and at the same time gave
her some chase Guns; she kept Fight∣ing,
Retreating, and wounded three of
the 
Sun of Africa
's Men, which was
ready to give her a whole Broadside
and to send her to the Deep, when, to
prevent it, she presently struck.


She was a tight Ship, carrying two
and twenty Guns, belonged to 
New Eng∣land,

and this was her first Voyage:
Her lading consisted chiefly in Materi∣als
for Shipping, and some Cod; we
put twenty Men on board her, and
steered for 
Martinico,
 but that Night
it blew very hard, and we were separa∣ted
from the 
Seditious
 in the storm;
and on the 11th we had sight of 
Barba∣does,

which we left to the North of
us.


Next Day early in the Morning, we
found our selves at two Leagues distance
from St. 
Lucia,
 which we had a desire
to leave behind us, but the Wind


took us short: This Island is high of
Scituation, covered all over with
Wood, and very remarkable for two
Peaks in it like a Sugar-loaf, that may
be seen at twenty Leagues distance in
clear Weather: We Coasted it all Day,
and on the 13th early in the Morning,
we found we were three Leagues from
the 
Diamond-Point
 of 
Martinico;
 we
plyed till Evening for to get into the
mouth of 
Sack-Royal,
 (as they call it)
where we Anchored at five, within
half a League of the Fort, which we
saluted with seven Pieces of Cannon,
and were answered with as many from
thence.


Next Day the Captain of the Fort
entred us for Careening; we found
four or five Ships there from 
Rochel

and 
Bourdeaux,
 and two 
Danes
 hired by

French
 Merchants for the Voyage, one
of which saluted us with five Guns,
which we answered with three: We
Anchored about two Spears length
from the 
Mead,
 where we took out our
first Tier, Provision, and Utensils, in
order to cleanse our Ship.


We understood on the 16th, that
the 
Seditious
 was come to Fort St. 
Peter,

and that the 
Glutton,
 laden with Sugar,


was sailed away for 
France,
 the same
Day we were entred for Careening.


The 
English
 failed not to send a Pack∣et-boat
to fetch away their Prisoners,
with a design to discover what state
we were in, and the 
French
 Prisoners
she brought over, told us that the
Guard-ship, that had given us Chase,
when she understood what we were,
not thinking her self safe in that Port,
had sailed away for 
Antegoe
 to joyn
another Ship of sixty Guns that cruised
about that Island: The Packet-boat went
from 
Port Royal
 to Fort St. 
Peter,
 where
all the 
English
 Prisoners that were in
the Island, were delivered up to her,
and some of whom the very same
Night, they were to sail for 
Barbadoes,

took away a small Privateer that was
ready to put to Sea, and had but one
Man to look after her; whereupon
the 
English
 Officers were presently
seized, and the Packet-boat sent back
to demand Satisfaction for this Seisure,
which was contrary to the Law of War.


On the first of 
December,
 tho' we
had not fully embarked all our things
that we had to put a Shoar, we left
the Careening place, to the end we
might put an stop to the desertion of


our Men, of whom we had already
lost no less than thirty, all of them
brave young Fellows, who sought for
nothing more than an opportunity to
fight for the honour of their Country,
in order to make their Fortune, or
lose their Lives, and who were en∣raged
at their sufferings now for
two Years together without any hopes
of attaining their Ends: And what is
still more lamentable, there were three
or four of them found starved to
Death on the Mountains about fifteen
Days after.


From the third at Night to the
fourth we set Sail for St. 
Peter
's Fort,
where we anchored at five in the
Evening, within Pistol-shot of Land,
and continued there to the thirteenth
to take in Water.


But seeing it is now a long time
since we have had any account of the
Islands of 
America;
 and that the face
of things there is much altered since
fifteen or twenty Years, I thought it
would not be impertinent to make a
short Description of the same, where∣on
depends all the rest that are in our
possession.




Martinico
 was at first Inhabited by
some 
French
 and 
English,
 who took this,
as was done by all the other Islands,
as a place of refuge, and each of them
upon different accounts: They lived
there a long time at Peace with the

Indians,
 who gave them a share of the

Cassave
 and Fruits that they Cul∣tivated;
but after the descent Mon∣sieur

d' Enambuc
 made on St. 
Christopher,

in the Year 1625, those 
Indians
 be∣ing
put in the head by their Wizards,
that these new Guests came with an
Intention to destroy them, and to take
away their Country, they resolved to
Massacre them; but the 
French
 disco∣vering
the design, took all the Caution
imaginable to prevent it.


In 1626 there was a Company erect∣ed
for the 
American
 Islands, and then they
began to be Peopled, and Ships fre∣quently
sailed thither, to Trade for
Sugar, for which they paid ready
Money; but after divers petty Wars,
there was a general Peace made with
the 
Indians
 in 1660, and they had
St. 
Vincent
 and 
Domingo
 assigned them
to retire to. They continue there to
this Day, and come constantly to
Trade with our 
French-men,
 between


whom and them there is so great an
unity, that when they catch the 
Eng∣lish,

whom they know to be our Ene∣mies,
they Murder and Eat them, and
the 
French
 themselves have no power
to bring them to give them Quarter:
The 
Jesuits,
 and other Orders settled
in these Parts, do from time to time
make small Voyages into their Islands,
to Instruct them in the Principles of
Religion; which they hear with a
great deal of Joy, but reap little Be∣nefit
thereby, as being still very tena∣cious
of their old Superstition.


The 
American
 Islands Company were
of no longer Duration than the Year
1651, when they sold them to the
Knights of 
Malta,
 and several particu∣lar
Persons; but now the King is
Master of them; where he has erected
Forts, and keeps good Garrisons. 
Mar∣tinico

is the residence of the General,
and Soveraign Courts of Judicature;
whereon depends St. 
Domingo, Guada∣lupa,
Granada, Mary-Galanda,
 the 
Saints,

St. 
Cross,
 St. 
Lucia,
 and 
Tabago;
 of
which they have abandoned the last
three. This Island is scituated in 14
degrees North Latitude; and 315, 25
minutes Longitude, stands high, and


is fifty five or sixty Leagues in Cir∣cumference.
It has the conveniency
of three Ports, where you may lade a∣bove
an hundred Ships every Year;
and their Names are the 
Cul-de-sac
Royal,
 the 
Bourg
 of St. 
Peter,
 and the

Cul-de-sac de la Trinity.


Cul-de-sac Royal
 is a large Bay to
the South of the Island,
 and at the
bottom whereof stands a pretty Town,
containing near three hundred Inha∣bitants,
where the General resides, and
the Courts of Justice are kept: The
Streets of it are straight, the Houses
regular, and mostly built of Wood;
and here the 
Capuchins
 have a very
fine Convent. The Fort which is ve∣ry
advantageously scituated, is built up∣on
a large and long Point of land that
runs out into the Sea, and makes
the best Careening place in all the
Islands: The Fort is no other way
accessible to the Sea-ward, but by
Layes or Banks of Rocks which do
encompass it; and the Town cannot
be otherwise approached to, than by
a small but very narrow Clascis, that
is flanked with an half Moon, and
two Bastions, lined with good Stone∣work;
and defended with a Ditch


full of Water; they have eighteen and
four and twenty Pounders mounted e∣very
way upon it, and six 
Marine
 Com∣panies
in Garrison. Monsieur 
de Blenac

before his death erected a Magazine of
Powder there, and a Cistern Bomb∣proof,
so that the Fort is now in a
Condition to withstand a whole Army.


The Town of St. 
Peter
 is pretty large,

and better peopled than that of 
Fort
Royal;
 but to speak the truth of it,
it's no more than one Street, a
good quarter of a League in length, full
of ascents and descents, and in several
Places interrupted with diverse curious
Rows of 
Orange
 Trees; to say nothing
of a River that runs cross the middle
thereof, that has excellent Water; this
River comes down from a great Val∣ley,
that stands behind the Town, and
where may be seen a great many
Sugar Plantations, that are very agree∣able
to the Eye: At one end of the
Town stands the 
Jesuits
 House, which
is curiously Built; and at the other the

Jacobins
 Church; where also there is a
small Convent of 
Ʋrsulines
 in the mid∣dle,
besides an Hospital, over which
the Brethren of 
Charity
 (as they are
called) have the super-intendency:


Most of the Houses there are built of
Wood, but very well, and the Inha∣bitants
are very Civil and Affable.

France
 may be known there by the
neatness of the People, and 
Martinico

can boast that her Females are as hand∣some
as the Women of 
Europe:
 There
had been a Fort at the mouth of the
River, which the Hurricans entirely
ruined and levelled to the Ground;
they have no more now there, than
two Companies of Foot, and two Bat∣teries
at both ends of the Town, consisting
of eight or ten Pieces of Cannon each;
but they are continually at Work there
to raise new Fortifications.


The 
English
 came thither in 1693,
with sixty Sail of Ships, and made
a descent above the Town towards the

Preacher's Point,
 from whence they
were vigorously repulsed by the Inha∣bitants,
who killed about fifteen Hun∣dred
of them upon the spot, with the
disadvantage of no more than twenty
Killed and Wounded on their own side;
and Monsieur 
de Blenac
 signalized him∣self
very much upon this Occasion: He
Marched in one Night from 
Fort Royal

with two hundred Men thither, and
so incouraged the Inhabitants, that it


may be said, it was almost to him
alone that the Success of this Expedi∣tion
was owing.


Cul-de sac de la Trinity,
 that stands
on the other side of the Island, is much
smaller, and less frequented than the
other Ports; besides which, there are
divers small Places on the Sea-side,
where Barks and Canoes take in
their Lading; so that since the taking
of St. 
Christopher's,
 whose Inhabitants
withdrew into other Islands, they rec∣kon

Martinico
 to have three thousand
Men bearing Arms, and above fifteen
thousand Negro-Slaves.


This Island, as has been already no∣ted,
is very high and so full of Mountains,
that the middle part thereof cannot be in∣habited;
but it's very fruitful in Sugars,
where they are now refined, in Cotton,

Rocou,
 Cinnamon, 
Cocoe,
 of which they
make Chocolate, in Magniot, and the
Fruits of the Country, which I have
describ'd already. They have very fine
sort of Wood there, especially that
which they call the 
Gayac,
 of which
they make Pullies, and such like things,
for the King's Men of War.


These, and several other Fruits, which
are transported thence into 
France
 grow


in this Country mighty well; and Sheep,
Oxen, and Horses, multiply amongst
them apace; and the Ships that sail
thither, whether singly, or in company,
to lade Sugar, carry with them Wines,
Corn, Salt-meats, and all sorts of Mer∣chandizes
they may have occasion for;
so that a Man of an Estate can live
there, as well as in 
France:
 But yet the
high Scituation of the Country makes
the Air unwholsome, and there are but
a few Ships that go thither, whose
Crew does not feel the Effects of it;
and we our selves, lost about a dozen
or fifteen Men, who died as it were
from one Day to another, without any
Symptom of being sick. The Inhabi∣tants,
besides the Inconveniency of a
bad Air, are much incommoded with
Ants, 
Mousticks,
 and a kind of an Hand∣worm,
which they call 
Chiques,
 and
which fix themselves in the soles of the
Feet, and are so much the more trou∣blesome
and insupportable, in that they
cannot be rooted out from thence, if
they have once time given them to
lay their Eggs there: Serpents are also
very common in this Island, and creep
into the very Houses, of which there
are se
eral sorts, whose stinging is very


dangerous; but the Negro's find 
Sim∣ples

there that cure them presently.


We made ready on the 13th to go
and take in Wood at St. 
Lucia,
 and
from thence to return to cruise on the
Coast of 
Barbadoes;
 but the 
Seditious

had been ordered away for a Convoy
to a Merchant-Ship, bound for 
Guada∣lupa,

where she received Monsieur 
de
Gennes
 his Commands, to make the
best of her way for 
France.


On the 14th,
 about Nine in the Mor∣ning,
we anchored in a great Bank of
Sand at St. 
Lucia,
 where a very good
Port may be made, and convenient
Habitations fixed. St. 
Lucia
 is of a
high Scituation, covered with Wood,
and rendred almost uninhabitable, by a
vast Number of Serpents that are to
be found there; but for all that, there
are two or three 
Indian Carbets,
 or Vil∣lages,
upon the place, and some 
French∣men,

who fetch Tortoises from thence
for 
Martinico:
 You will find upon the
Sea-shoar, a great many 
Macheveliers,

which is a Tree that does not grow
very tall, whose Wood is very fine, and
its Leaves like unto those of a Pear-tree;
it bears small Apples, that are of such
a Smell and Colour, as do invite Peo∣ple


to eat of them; but it's very dan∣gerous
to comply with the Tempta∣tion;
for there is no Antidote that can
secure a Man from a speedy Death,
that hath once tasted of them: The
very Leaf of it makes an Ulcer upon
the place it toucheth, the Dew that
falls from them takes away the Skin,
and the very Shadow of this Tree
makes a Man swell to that degree,
that it will infallibly kill him without
speedy help.


On the 15th, in the Afternoon, we
weigh'd Anchor, and kept pretty near
the Shoar, that we might be able to get
to the Coast of St. 
Vincent,
 within two
Leagues of which we found our selves
next Morning by break of Day: But
it was three in the Afternoon before we
could draw near, tho' we had a small
Gale that was favourable enough; and
this made us suppose that the Currents
were against us; but it blowing at
length, at three of the Clock, a fresh
Gale, we made a little more sail, and
coasted within half a League of the
Island, where we saw a very fine Coun∣try,
and seemingly well cultivated:
The same is inhabited, on the Coast by
which we passed, with twelve or fif∣teen


hundred Negro's, that fled thither
from the Neighbouring Islands, and
especially from 
Barbadoes,
 from whence
they made their Escapes, with a favou∣rable
Wind, in their Masters Canoes:
But the other side is Peopled with
two or three thousand 
Indians,
 who have
a great Trade with those that dwell
upon the River 
Orenoquo
 that is on the
Continent, whither they pass in their

Pirogues,
 as they do to all the Islands
scituate in the Gulph of 
Mexico;
 and
that which is very wonderful, is, That
they are never overtaken with bad
Weather, but that on the contrary, they
are always aware of the Day wherein
an Hurricane happens, a long time be∣fore
the same doth come to pass.


St. 
Vincent
 is also high of Scituation,
abounding in Fruits, Fowl, in Goats
and Hogs. There is a very fine Port
there to Lee-ward, which the 
Eng∣lish

some Years since, would have
made themselves Masters of; but the

Indians
 prevented their making a De∣scent,
with Showers of poison'd Ar∣rows,
and the Assistance of the Ne∣gro's,
who took Vengeance on them
for all the ill Usage they had met with
at the hands of that Nation.



On the 17th we doubled that Place
they call the 
Pomgranates,
 and next Day
saw the Island of 
Tabago,
 which the
Mareschal 
d' Estre
 took from the 
Dutch

in 1678. after two of the sharpest En∣gagements
that have been heard of;
but this Island is now desolate, and
serves only for a place of Retreat to
Birds. About Noon we steered towards

Barbadoes,
 which we discovered on the
one and twentieth; and having a fair
Wind on the 25th and 26th, we made
much of our way towards 
Barbadoes.


On the 31th we discovered, by break
of Day,
 a small Vessel to Leeward,
and made all the Sail we could to come
up with her; and as she saw we were got
near her, and that it was to no purpose
to flee, she came to, and staid for us:
She was a Vessel of forty Tuns, that
had been three Months sailing from

Bristol
 for the 
Barbadoes,
 and was laden
with Beer, Syder, Herrings, Cheese,
Butter, Hats, and several sorts of other
Goods, being valued at 20000 Livres.
We put eight Men on board her, and
sent her away for 
Martinico.


Next Day, which was the first of

January,
 1697.
 we discovered also ano∣ther
Vessel, four Leagues to Wind∣ward


of us, and we bore up towards
her till three in the Afternoon, but could
not come up with her, which made us
give o'er the Chase.


On the 6th we had a sight of 
Bar∣badoes.

As Monsieur 
de Gennes,
 who had
been sick for fifteen Days, found himself
now sicker than ordinary, he thought
fit to return to 
Martinico.
 We left the

Sun of Africa
 behind us, to cruise, which
she did for five or six Days, without
purchase; and we making all the Sail
we could, next Day about four in the
Evening discovered the Coast of
St. 
Lucia,
 which we left to Lee∣ward
of us; and on the 8th, about ten
in the Morning, entred the Port they
call 
Cul-de-Sac Royal:
 We were come
very near the Fort, and ready to cast
Anchor, when we met with a great
Rock, that took out three of our Ship's
outer Planks, without doing us any fur∣ther
Damage; we quickly brought her
back, and anchored a good Cannon∣shot
from the Shoar; and indeed it's
dangerous to get nearer, and we had
good luck to come off so well.


We discharged our Prizes, and sold
the Goods very well, because the Inha∣bitants,
who were in daily Expectation


of the Arrival of Monsieur 
d' Ambli∣mont
's
Fleet, wanted Provisions; and it's
certain they had not twenty Barrels of
Meal left in the whole Island. The
Free-booters had contributed very much
to subsist them for the first Years of the
War, by the many Prizes they had ta∣ken
on the Coast of 
Barbadoes,
 St. 
Chri∣stopher,

and the other Islands belonging
to the 
English,
 but now their Merchant-ships
sailed together in Fleets; and there
are also some of them, who to avoid
the Privateers, go to the Coast of 
Ta∣bago

and 
la Trinity,
 and come back
again to recover 
Barbadoes.


On the 24th we made ready to sail
for the Fort of St. 
Peter,
 where we
anchored on the 25th, and continued
in that place till the fourth of the next
Month, to take in Sugar, 
Cassia,
 and

Cocoe,
 with which 
Martinico
 almost
supplies all 
France:
 The 
Cassia
 grows
in Husks about half a Foot long, upon
a Tree much like unto our Walnut-tree.


The 
Cocoe
 grows no where but in
moist Places,
 and such as are but little
exposed to the Sun; the Tree that
produces it is but small, the Fruit is
long and uneven, like a Cucumber;


when it is ripe they gather it, and
leave it for a time to dry in the Sun;
it's properly nothing else but a rind,
like that of the 
Pomgranate,
 that con∣tains
about five and twenty, or thir∣ty
Beans, of which thy make Choco∣late.


On the 31st. we fitted out a 
Bri∣gantine,

to sail to 
Barbadoes,
 to ex∣change
the Prisoners they had made
of the Crew of a small Free-booter,
that had been taken in sight of 
Guada∣lupa.


I have a mind, before we go from
hence, to relate the Adventure of our
Poor 
Mango,
 who gave us continually
some diversion or other; this was an
old Monkey we had, belonging once
to the Governour of 
Gambie;
 who was
so prodigiously strong, that he broke his
Chain at least once in eight Hours; and
as soon as he got loose, he failed not to
make a Ravage: His main Care was
to get him a Dinner, and when he had
fooled any poor Seaman out of his Mess,
it was very pleasant to see him get
up to the top of the Masts, and to
jump from one Sail unto another with
a dish of Rice, or a great Piece of
Bacon in his Paws. If any one was


so bold as to go about to take away
his prey, he threw a Cannon-ball at
his Head, or what ever else came
in his way; all which was nothing in
comparison of the Wounds of his
Teeth, which made such an Impression,
that the Marks of them some times
remained for the space of two Months
and upwards. At last he took upon
him to throw into the Sea the Wheels
of an Ivory-Clock which Monsieur

de Gennes
 had ordered to be made, and
took up two Years time in the do∣ing:
But this was no sooner known,
than that the poor Devil was condem∣ned
to have his head chopped off, and
therefore he was carryed a Shoar to
have the Sentence Executed upon him;
but he managed his part so well, that
after two or three Pistols shot at him,
he broke his Cord and took to his
feet; and all that Day we saw the
poor Animal, as wounded as he was,
run up and down along the Shoar, to
seek out an opportunity to return on
Board; and if he was much concerned
for losing of us, we were no less to
find our selves deprived of his dear
Company.



From the fourth at Night to the
fifth of 
February,
 we made ready to
sail for 
Guadalupa.
 As for our Great
Prize which remained at Fort 
Royal,

to dispose of her Wood, and relade
with Sugar, we left twenty Men on
board of her; but for the other two
Prizes, we sold them, tho' to no great
advantage, because they were but
small, and the Lading inconsidera∣ble.


At the 
Preacher
's 
Point
 we met an

English
 Prize, taken by the Merchant-ship,
that entred at the same time
with us into 
Cayenne,
 near St. 
Christo∣phers;

then we Coasted St. 
Domingo,
 and
on the sixth anchored very near the
Shoar before 
Guadalupa,
 even in the
midst of the Town, to the South-west
of the Island, at the bottom of a very
high Sulphurous Cavity, that casts out
smoke continually, and oftentimes fire.
We got our full Cargoe in less than
two Days, and the Inhabitants came
to intreat us with great earnestness to
take off their Goods, so that we could
have laden fifteen Ships in fifteen
Days time.


This Island is very large, and heal∣thier
than 
Martinico,
 being divided in∣to


two parts by an Arm of the Sea,
called the 
Salt-River,
 by which Barks
may pass up when the Tide is in; the
Land is high, but fruitful in Sugar,
Indico, and Cotton: Here also they
have 
Rocou, Cassia, Cocoe,
 and very good
Comfits. Fruits and Fowl are very
common there; and they have a sort
of Birds about the forementioned sul∣phurous
Cavity, which they call 
Dia∣bolins,

which are very large, and as
good as Pullets; they live upon nothing
else but Fish, which they vomit up to
feed their Young withal, and the In∣habitants
send out their Negro's to
take them; but whether it be that they
are not used to it, or that the Cold,
or the Air of the said sulphurous Ca∣vity
seizes upon them, they are taken
with such a languishment upon it, that
they cannot surmount without much
Difficulty; they also find several boyl∣ing
Fountains in this Island.


That part of the Island which stands
to the Northward, because of its being
larger than the other, is called 
The
Great Land,
 and hath been inhabited a
long time, but at present has not above
an hundred Inhabitants. The other,
which is known by the Name of 
Gua∣dalupa,



has two Companies of Foot in it,
about a thousand Inhabitants fit to bear
Arms, and a great Number of Negro-Slaves:
The 
Jesuits, Jacobins, Capu∣chins

and 
Carmelites,
 have their Parishes
there in distinct Places, as well as in

Mary-Galand,
 and the Island called

Saints.


The Town where we cast Anchor,
is the most considerable and almost the
only one of the Island, being divided into
two parts by a small River, which runs
from behind the sulphurous Cavity
we have already mentioned; it's large
enough, and the greatest part of the
Houses in it are built of Stone: There
is a Battery of eight pieces of Cannon
erected in the middle, and the same
commands all the Road; and at the
end thereof, upon the Bank of a swift
Torrent, stands a little Fort defended
by eight pieces of Cannon, and lined
with good Stone-Work.


The 
English
 made a Descent upon
this Place in 1691, burnt the Town,
took away the Battery that stood in
the middle of it; and there was none
but this Fort made good by the Inha∣bitants,
till Monsieur 
d' Ʋragny,
 then
General of the Islands, came with three


or four Men of War, and some Mer∣chant
Ships, fitted up in haste to raise
the Siege; when the 
English
 re-imbarked
with Precipitation; and left above two
hundred Men in the Woods, to the
Mercy of the 
French.


Between the tenth at Night, and the
eleventh, we weighed Anchor, and at
break of Day saw a 
Brigantine,
 that
bore up towards us, when we on our
part did the same in respect to her;
upon which about Noon we fired
three Pieces of Cannon, which made
her presently alter her Course; it is like∣ly
she might be some small 
English

Privateer, that look'd after some Prey
on these Coasts.


On the 12th and 13th we were ve∣ry
much becalmed,
 and on the 15th
we discovered the Island of St. 
Cross,

which many of our Crew were con∣fident,
to be the Islands called the

Virgins;
 for indeed at a distance it
appeared to be no other than a Num∣ber
of little Islands separated from one
another: Here they have Sugar, Cot∣ton,
and Indico, great plenty of Fowl
and Swine. And Cows and Horses
would have multiplied here apace:
But as they were from Day to Day appre∣hensive


of the loss of this Island, they
caused the Inhabitants to withdraw
to St. 
Domingo,
 with all their Effects,
and entirely to abandon the Place.


On the 16th by break of Day we
discovered St. 
Thomas,
 that is to Lee∣ward
of all the Isles of the 
Virgins:

It's very remarkable for many Banks,
and white Towers that do surround the
Port of it: Upon our approach we dis∣covered
the Town, and a great For∣tress
of Stone-work that defends the
Entrance of it, without which rode
three large Ships. This Island belong∣ed
to the 
Danes;
 the 
Hamburghers
 have
an Agent there, and the Product of
the Place is Sugar and Indico, but no
very great Quantity of either; and
they would not think it worth their
while to mind it, but that this does
facilitate the Trade they drive in Ne∣gro's
with the 
Spaniards
 of 
Portorico,

that is about fifteen Leagues off.


About Noon we doubled the Island
of St. 
Thomas,
 and left a great white
Rock on the left, that looked at a di∣stance,
like a Hoy under-sail: This

Euripus,
 as I may call it, is very com∣modious
for the Merchant-ships that
stand in fear of the 
Corsairs,
 which they


cannot many times escape, when they
sail by St. 
Christophers, Saba,
 and others
of the Enemies Islands.


On the seventeenth, eighteenth, nine∣teenth
and twentieth, we had a great
deal of Rain and but little Wind; and
on the one and twentieth, we past the
Tropick of 
Cancer.
 From the twenty
third to the twenty eighth we had va∣riable
Winds, and very rainy Wea∣ther.


The second and third of 
March
 we
had great Winds,
 Rains, and foggy
Weather, and the following Days we
were becalmed: We found our selves
parallel to the 
Bermudoes,
 but an hun∣dred
and fifty Leagues distance from it,
as being a Place which all the Ships
that come from the Islands, take care
to shun, seeing they have found by
constant Experience, they must meet
with bad Weather there; for the con∣trary
Winds either forces them to
draw near it, or to pass to Lee-ward
of it.


On the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, we
had a fair Wind and moderate Weather
but from the time of our leaving
St. 
Thomas,
 till we came parallel with
the 
Azores,
 we saw Herbs every Day


floating upon the Sea, which those
who had sailed upon the Coasts of 
New
Spain,
 told us came from the Channel
of 
Bahama,
 from whence they were
carried into the main Ocean by the
rapidity of the Currents, and then
dispersed over all this Sea, by the
Westerly Winds that continually blow
upon the Coasts of 
Virginia
 and 
New-England.


On the 10th we had both Winds
and Rain, and the Weather was very
cold; we came parallel to the 
Azores,

and kept at an hundred and fifty Leagues
distance from the Isle of 
Corva.


On the 11th we had very great
Winds, but they blowing of us on∣ward
in our way, we were easily
brought to acquiesce with them.


Very early on the 12th in the Mor∣ning,
the Winds blew very hard, the
Heavens were all over-cast, and the Sea
grew very boisterous and terrible,
and it was with very great Difficulty
that we could carry low Sails: We
had a Foot of Water in the Hole,
but we could not use our Pumps;
the Waves were as high as our
Masts, and came in upon us on all
sides: And in this dangerous pickle


we continued all the Day: But about
ten at Night the Winds began to al∣lay,
and on the thirteenth we re∣joned
the 
Sun of Africa,
 which the
bad Weather had separated from us
the Day before, and whose Gallery
had been swept away by a great
Wave.


On the sixteenth, being come paral∣lel
to Cape 
Finister,
 we made all the
Sail we could to get a sight of it;
and next Day, at five in the Even∣ing,
we saw a small Vessel two Leagues
to Windward of us, and which
we believed was bound for the Bank
of 
New-found-Land:
 But on this, and
the two succeeding Days, we had
Hail, Rain, and very cold Winds.


On the nineteenth we discovered a
pretty large Ship three Leagues to
Leeward, whom we chased for four
Hours, but could not come up with
her.


And on the twentieth, by break of
Day, we found another within two
Cannon-shot of us, which made us
put out all our Sails, and give her
chase, which continued for seven
hours: But as we had but little
Wind, we could not come up with


her, and so we resumed our Course
again.


From the two and twentieth to the
27th, the Weather was very hazy;
and for six Days together, we saw
neither Sun, Moon, nor Stars, and had
but very little Wind.


On the 17th we saw three Ships
to Windward of us, which we did
not think convenient to look after,
seeing our Provision was now almost
spent, and that it was our Interest to
improve our time well; and this same
Night, we beheld a Rain-bow cross
the Heavens, which, without recei∣ving
any Reflection from the Stars,
that were very much over-cast, had a
very lively red Colour.


The 28th, 29th, and 30th, we had
favourable Winds, and fine moderate
Weather.


But now the first Day of the Month
of 
April
 being come,
 the Wind chopp'd
about all of a sudden, and came con∣trary;
at what time we accounted our
selves not above fifty Leagues from
Cape 
Finister:
 Next Day the Winds
bare hard upon us, and disabled us to
make the Cape.



But on the fourth and fifth they
began to allay, and proved fair enough;
and next Day, at seven in the Mor∣ning,
we discovered about a League
from us to Leeward, a pretty large
Ship, which we chased all Night long,
gained much upon her, and had it
not been for a Fog that fell for two
Hours, by favour of which she sail∣ed
away, she had certainly given us
either Bullets or Bread, which last we
now most wanted, all our Provisions
being spent, and the Winds still con∣trary.


On the eighth we saw 
Pewets,
 and
other Sea-birds, who are never seen
very far from the Shoar; next
Day being the ninth, we met with a
sort of little Sparrows, who passed over
our Sail-yards without resting them∣selves;
and this was an infallible sign
unto us, that we were not far from Land.


On the 12th at break of Day, we
descry'd two Ships at a League's di∣stance
from us, but we could not come
up with them, our Ships being too
foul, too full of Herbs and Shell∣work,
to think of gaining upon Vessels
newly careened, as we apprehended
these to be.



On the 13th we saw several Birds
that waited as well as we, for a fa∣vourable
Wind to put them a-shoar;
next Day the Wind was boisterous,
and we had much Rain, Hail and melt∣ing
Snow: And we lost Company with
the 
Sun of Africa
 in a Fog, who not
observing the Signal, sailed away,
while we were setting our Round-tops,
that were displaced, in order again.


On the 15th the Wind being some∣what
allay'd, and the Weather clear∣ing
up, about break of Day we saw
five Ships, three to the Star-board,
and two to the Lar-board; but we
were not in a Condition to go and
look after any them.


By the sixteenth our Provision was
all spent,
 and we necessitated to use
the Sugar and 
Cocoe
 of the Merchants,
to make Chocolate for the Ships Crew;
which is a Liquor that is of a very
nourishing nature, and might serve
instead of Victuals; but our Seamen,
who were not accustomed to it, did
not like it at all, and said it made their
heads giddy.


On the 17th at Sun rising, we thought
we had the sight of the Tower of 
Cor∣dovan,

but our joy was short-lived, and


this Tower was all of a sudden Trans∣formed
into a Ship.


At last on the 18th, after a traverse
of sixty seven Days, we sounded and
found a Bottom, and were come
parallel to 
Pertuis de Maumusson,
 about
twenty Leagues distance from the
Shoar: On the ninteenth we had but a
small Wind.


But on the 20th we discovered 
Roche∣bonne,

which is fifteen Leagues wide
of 
Pertuis d' Antioch;
 the Sea, tho' very
even, proved now to be broken and
violent: About Noon we saw four
Ships, and they Steered the same Course
with us. Soon after we discovered the
Steeple of 
God
's-
Island,
 about five
in the the Evening, the 
Whale-Tower

in the Isle of 
Rhee,
 and at Night we
came to an Anchor, to wait for the
Tide.


On the 21st we weigh'd, and by
break of Day we found our selves
within two Cannon-shot of four Ships,
which we had seen the Day before, which
made us put out 
French
 Colours:
They did the like, and we sent our

Canoe
 on board them, to know what
news from 
France:
 They happened to
be a Bark of the Isle of 
Oleron,
 and


three St. 
Malo
 Men, half men of War,
and half Merchants, who were going
to take in Salt in the Isle of 
Rhee,
 and
from thence to fish on the bank of

New-found-Land:
 They gave us six
Baskets of Bread, one Barrel of Ba∣con,
and some Beer, which a little
refreshed our men. The St. 
Malo

men passed by 
Pertuis Breton,
 and we
by that of 
Antioch,
 and so on till a∣bout
Midnight, we cast Anchor be∣fore

Rochelle,
 where we found the

Sun
 of 
Africa,
 who was got into that
Port two Days before us.
