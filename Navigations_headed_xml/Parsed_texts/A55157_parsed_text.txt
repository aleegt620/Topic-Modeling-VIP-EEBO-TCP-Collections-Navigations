A Panegyrick Mercury UPON THE SUCCESSES AGAINST THE TURKS, In the 
AUTUMN,
 1683.


BY the Goodness and Bounty of Pope 
Innocent
 the XI.


By the Councils and Industry of the most August Emperor, 
Leopold
 the I.


By the Good Fortune and Dispatch of 
John
 the III. King of 
Poland.


By the Truth and Bravery of 
Maximilian,
 Electoral-Duke of 
Bavaria.


By the Generosity and Courage of 
John George
 the III. Electoral-Duke of 
Saxony.


By the Vigilance of 
Charles,
 Duke of 
Lorrain,
 in the Field.


By the Constancy of 
Ernestus,
 Count 
Staremberg,
 within the Walls.


In fine, By the Joint Force


Of the Fighting Layety, and the Praying Priesthood.


By an admirable Agreement of All in the Best Cause.


With the Aids of CHRIST.


Without the Reinforcements of the most Christian Prince.


Against the Anti-Christian.


VIENNA
 stands Delivered;


The 
Turkish
 Power staggers;


The Fortune of Rebellion falls;


The Gate of 
Gran
 is Open'd;


Austria
 shines after its Fires, and tryumphs after Fields of Blood;


For whom 
GOD
 alwayes employs Wonders


Against the Councils of the 
Ottoman
 and 
French.


Dread therefore, ye Enemies, 
GOD
 Fighting for 
Leopold!


Love, ye Subjects, 
Leopold,
 Fighting for 
GOD!


Utter Ruine be your Hope, ye Rebels!


Entire Victory yours, our Loyal Friends!


For,


Let Heaven, and Earth, and Hell be moved,


In the End,


The Good CAUSE is Crowned.
