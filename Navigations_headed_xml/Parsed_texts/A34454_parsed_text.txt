To my dear
BROTHER
Major Francis Manley.


Dear Brother,


T
He Dedication (as vvell
as Writing) of Books
being strongly vvarrant∣ed
by Custom (the great
Moderatour of our Af∣fairs
and Actions) it ap∣peareth
not injurious to me, that this
Translation pass into the World under
your conduct; vvhose pretentions as
they stand fair to the Patronage of more
sublime Labours, so I am assured they
vvill not be vvanting in their Indulgence
to the Infirmities of this Trifle, upon
vvhich the Book-seller having prevailed


vvith me to cast avvay some spare hours,
as a Complement to my Countrey (at
least to his Interests) I vvas more easily
tempted to undertake it, as vvhat might
be advertisement to you; so that hovv
cheap soever it appear in it self, my dear
Brother hath goodness enough to con∣sider
it, as exposing me to the censure of
thousands upon the single account of di∣verting
him alone; and that having been
a principal design of my life, I make this
address, vvhere my affection, not my
ambition, leads me.


For the Matter, it is the Author must
stand accountable, not I; (and I can as∣sure
you, he is of a passable reputation
in his ovvn Countrey) but for the bad
English, I hope a Fourteen years Exile
may excuse the Errataes in our very Mo∣ther-Tongue.
I vvill not further be∣speak
your protection, left it be judged
the effect of my importunity, and not
your kindeness; I therefore commit you
to Him, vvho hath preserved you and
me, through no ordinary dangers, to see


the Land of our 
Canaan,
 though not to
enjoy the fruits of it; but the happiness
of our Soveraign doth virtually com∣prehend
in it that of all His Creatures;
in vvhich number as it is your honour and
mine, upon the score of an unalterable
loyalty, attended vvith many sufferings,
and our best services to stand ranked; so
is it my extream contentment and satis∣faction,
that I may style my self,


Dear BROTHER,


Your most faithful and most
affectionate Brother, and
humble Servant,
Roger Manley.

A True Description of the
Mighty Kingdomes of
IAPAN & SIAM.


M
Y fourteene yeares residence
in the low Countreys, (I may
rather say my banishement
thither,) being upon the
rendition of one of the Kings
Garrisons, in the yeare, 1646
obliged by my Articles to
depart the Kingdome within six moneths (As
it hath, in some measure, furnished me with
the knowledg of the Dutch tongue, so hath it
given me roome to observe the indefatigable
industry of that people, who all of them, in their
severall stations, and according to their severall
povvers and capacities, doe unanimously cons∣pire
& cooperate to their support and grovvth
in the World. And that I, by their example, or ra∣ther
by the impulse of my owne 
Genius,
 may
cast my mite, into the service of my Countrey, I
judged it not wholy unprofitable to put this




short relation of the Great Kingdomes of 
Japan

& 
Siam
 into the English tongue, which for the
vastnesse of those Territories (scarce knowne to
us by name) The Reputation of the Authour
(vvhose Collections are of great credit) But prin∣cipally,
as a spur to the Improvement of further
discoveries & Traffick by my ovvne Coūtrey men,
will not, I hope, be unacceptable to the Reader,
who I wish may so far indulge the bad English
of one almost degenerated into a forreigner, (at
least in his language) that it may receive a faire
acceptation, which is all I propose to my self in
this matter. I am not ignorant that amongst
the multitude of books, under which the Presse
groanes, it is not enough, to write well. But
I being restrayned to a Translation, must not pre∣tend
to rise higher then my fountayne head. And
my Authour having made rather a collectiō then
a History, wherein he seemes to affect truth
and brevity, more then the ornament of words
I thought it becoming me, if I would walke in
his ground, to tread in his steps, wherein if you
will please to divert your selfe I shall in his Per∣son
proceed to tell you.






How great the Countrey of Iapan
is & whether it be an Island
or no.


THe Countrey of 
Japan
 is supposed to bee
an Island, though there bee no certainty of
it, this vast territorie not beeing yet wholy dis∣covered
to the inhabitants themselves. I have
often enquired and been informed that Tra∣vellers
have gone from the Province of 
Quanto,

the principal of his Majesties dominions where∣in
the Imperial Citie and Pallace of 
Iedo
 are
scituated, 27 daies North-East wards, before
they could reach the utmost point of the land
of 
Sungaer,
 bordering upon the Sea; being come
thither they passed over an Istmus of thirty
three English miles broad, leading into the Coū∣try
of 
Iezzo
 abounding in skins & furrs of price.
This territorie is very great, mountainous but
litle inhabited. The 
Iappaners
 attempted its dis∣covery
severall times but in vaine, for though
they entred to & fro, far into the Countrey, yet
they could never find its end, nor any certainty
cōcerning it, their provisions ordinarily failing
them, which inforced their fruitlesse returnes.
The discoverers reports of these, were soe im∣perfect
that his Majestie dispaired of any fur∣ther
Satisfaction, the countrey being presented


as desolate and unpassable, though in some place
inhabited with a people all over hairy (wear∣ing
their Beards long, like the Chinesses) brutish,
though otherwise well shaped. To consider
therefore the uncertianty whether this Coun∣trey
be an Island or no; wee may observe that
the passage betvveene 
Sungaer
 and 
Iezzo
 is no
running water, but an Inlet or long Istmus of the
Sea it selfe, 120 English Miles long, extending it
selfe betvvixt 
Iezzo
 and 
Iapan,
 where it bounds
upon vast mountaines and deserts, about the
Province of 
Ochio;
 so that, that way being
vvholly unpassable by land, travellers are for∣ced
to ferry over the aforesaid 
Isthmus
 from

Sungaer
 to 
Iezzo,
 in Barkes and such shipping
as they have: The tvvo great Islands of 
Chir∣kock

and 
Saykock
 are governed by Kings and
Lords that share vvith them in the Magistracie.

Chirkock
 hath one King and three Lords. 
Saykock

being the bigger of the tvvo, hath more Gover∣nours,
but both are accounted Provinces of this
great Empire, though least in extent of those
whereof it is composed.








How many Provinces it con∣taynes.


THat great Territory which we call 
Iapan,
 &
the inhabitants 
Nippon,
 borders upon those
afore mentioned Islands and strecheth to the
unknovvne Countrey of 
Iezzo,
 & is divided into
five Provinces, to wit, 
Iam Aystero, Ietsengo, Ietse∣sen,
Quanto
 & 
Ochio,
 the which, with the Islands
of 
Saykock
 & 
Chirkock,
 make seaven in all, whose
Dominions, Cities and Castles are subdivided
under severall Kings and Lords as the follo∣vving
specification of the Revenue of the vvhole
land aboundantly shevveth.

What qualitie & authority the

THe supreame Magistrate in 
Japan
 is stiled
Emperor in respect of the Kings & Princes
that are under his Obedience, He is Soveraign
Lord and Ovvner of the whole land and

during my residence there) to banish and
punish with death, at pleasure, his offending
Kings and Lords, and to give avvay their Com∣mands
and Treasures to those he fancies more
deserving then they.






His dwelling place, magnificence
& Traine


The Imperial Citie of 
Iedo,
 where his Maiesty
resides, is very great, his Pallace cōtaynes in
circuit six English miles, being encōpassed with
three Moats and three Counterscharpes: These
Ditches are very deep, being bordered on both
sides vvith high and strong Stone vvalls strange∣ly
angular: The first circumference, entring in∣to
the second, the second into the third, and
this againe into the second and first, so odly that
it is impossible, by reason of the multiplicity of
the poynts & vvorkes, to remember the fashion
of the whole, and it is not permitted to take the
plaine thereof. Such as enter must goe through
a passage of three or foure hundred paces, forti∣fied
with Eight or Nyne huge gates not right
over each other, but ansvvering the points and
halfe circles in the mentioned vvalles, betvvixt
every tvvo ports there is a large plaine guarded


with a Company of Souldiers, and those being
past several heights with broad stone Stairs and
Walls, which being likewise surmounted, se∣veral
great Plains bordered with large Galleries
against the Sun and Rain, do present themselves
to the common view. The Streets in the Ca∣stle
are extraordinary large, built on each side
with goodly Pallaces, belonging to the Lords
of the Kingdom: The Castle Gates are very
strong, and covered on both sides with iron
Bars of an inch thick crossing each other, and
fastened with Bolts of the same: every Gate
hath his House large enough to contain two or
three hundred Souldiers, and defensible upon
occasion: within, in the midst of the first cir∣cumference,
standeth his Majesties Pallace; it is
great, and consisteth of several dwellings beau∣tified
with Woods, to the envy of Nature, full
of Ponds, Rivers, Gardens, Plains, Courts,
places to Pickeer and Sport in, and moreover,
contains all the dwellings of his Women. The
second Circumference is inhabited by the next
Princes of the blood, and those of the Council:
And the third is possessed with the proud Pal∣laces
and dwellings of the severall Kings and
principal Dukes, and Lords of 
Japan.
 The
Cheifs of Lesser note have their Houses with∣out
the third Round, each adorned according
to the Dignity and Riches of the Owners, all


almost gilt, so that this goodly Edifice appears
at a distance not unlike a Mountain of Gold;
for all the Lords (none excepted) rack them∣selves
to please his Majesty by beautifying his
Castle and their own Habitations; which their
lawful Wives and Children do likewise enjoy
after their decease, continuing always under
the Emperors eye as Hostages of their fidelity.
This City of 
Iedo
 is nine English Miles long,
and six broad, and is as closely built as any City
in Europe.


The Court, how great soever, is dayly
crowded with multitudes of Nobles, who with
their numerous Trains with Horses and 
Pa∣lanquins

make the Streets too narrow for their
passage. When the Emperor goeth abroad,
sometimes on Horse-back, and sometimes car∣ried
in a 
Pallanquin,
 open on every side, he is
ordinarily accompanied with these Lords, who
are called his Majesties Companions; being
all of them of high State and Revenues, though
without Lands or other Office save their atten∣dance:
They are Persons extraordinarily qua∣lified;
some in Musick and Singing, others in
Physick, Writing, Painting, Elocution, and the
like. These are followed by the Life-Guard,
all Persons of quality and choice, being the
natural Sons of Kings and Princes, begot on
their Concubines and uncapable of succession;


and the Brothers, Cosins and Kindred of great
Lords, which, by reason of their many Women,
are very numerous: I will give you one example.
The Emperors Uncle, King of Mito, now fifty
four years old, hath as many Sons as he hath
years, and many more Daughters, whose num∣ber
is unknown. After these follows part of
the second Life-Guard, which consisting of
some thousands, is so divided, that half goes
a Cannon shot before his Majesty, and the
other half follows at the same distance.


However the number of these Souldiers be
great, yet there is not one of them which hath
not passed Examination, and found to be thus
qualified: They must be active of body, ready
in the use of all sorts of Arms, and somewhat
knowing in their Studies; especially well exer∣cised
and trained, which they are to a wonder:
for when his Maiesty moves, they go along,
Horse and Foot, clothed all in black Silk, and
ranked before, behinde, and on each side of
him: They march in such comely order, that
never a one is observed to go out of his place;
and with such silence, that they neither speak
nor make any the least noise: Neither indeed
do the Citizens move their lips when the Em∣peror
passeth, nothing being then heard but
the ruffling of Men and Horses: The ways
and streets, are at such times, made very clean,


strewed with sand and sprinkled with water:
No doors are shut, and yet no body dares look
out either at them or at the windows, or so
much as stand in their shops to see the Empe∣ror
pass; all must keep within doors, unless
such who will kneel upon mats before them.
When his Maiesty goes on progress to 
Miako,

sometimes the imperial City, which happens
once every five or seven Years, to give the

Deyro
 (which is the true Heir of the King∣dom
and lives there) a visit, the preparations
are making an whole year before the orders
are given on what day and with what train
every great Man shall go, to the end that the
ways may not be pestered with their num∣bers.
Half of the great Lords, according to
their turns set out some days before, then
follows his Maiesty with his Councellers, who
are followed some days after by the remain∣ing
Kings and Lords. The concourse of peo∣ple
at such a time is incredible, the whole City,
though containing above One hundred thou∣sand
Houses, not being big enough to lodge
them all; so that tents and huts are raised round
about the same for the Souldiers and common
People.


The distance betwixt 
Jedo
 and 
Miako
 is
reckoned to be one hundred twenty five Dutch
miles; At every two or three miles there is a


City or open Town; and the whole is divi∣ded
into twenty and eight Gists or Lodgings,
whereof twenty are strong Castles: there is in
every quarter, from the first to the last, a train
of Gentlemen, Souldiers, Horse, Provisions,
and all necessaries befitting so great a Prince,
ordered there for his reception and entertain∣ment.
Those that set out with him from 
Jedo

stay in the first lodging; those that were there
remove with him to the second; those of the
second to the third, and so to the last; so that
each train and their dependants follow his Ma∣jesty
but half a day, until all of them, accord∣ing
to their instructions, marching in order,
do at length arrive at 
Miako,
 leaving the afore∣said
Castles and Lodgings to their usual Go∣vernors
and Guards. In the return from 
Mia∣ko

to 
Jedo
 the same method is observed, all
things being prepared as formerly, without
trouble or confusion.


This year 1636 there is an extraordinary
great Edifice and Building at 
Niko,
 four days
journey from 
Jedo,
 which is to be the Burial
place of the Emperors Father, in whose Temple
the great Copper Crown which the East-India-Company
gave his Majesty last year, is hung
up. There is likewise in this territory of 
Nia∣ko

a very great Castle, with double moats and
stone walls, strong and sumptuous: there are


several Palaces in it; as also a great number of
Artificers, as Painters, Masons, Statue-Cutters,
Gold, Silver, and Iron-Smiths, Cloathiers, and
all sorts of Handy-Crafts-Men, who have their
tasks set them, but are well paid. This Castle,
which seemed to require three years for its
building, was finished in five moneths, though
it lies far in the Country, and out of all ways,
being only made to receive his Majesty in his
ceremonious visits of his Fathers Sepulchre.


His Majesties Treasure consists in Silver and
Gold, packd in Chests, each weighing one thou∣sand

Teyls,
 that is about fourscore ordinary
pounds weight: these are placed in the several
Towers of his Castle together, with other le∣gacies,
with their writings, which are kept for
their Antiquity. This vast Treasure increases
dayly, for the Revenue of two moneths, is suf∣ficient
to defray the Emperors expences, how
great soever, for one whole year.


This Emperors Father being the Son of 
Ongo∣schio,

who possessed himself of the Government
after the late troubles, died about the fiftieth
year of his age, in the year of our Saviour 1631:
being sensible of his end, he called his Son to
him, and amongst many other good counsels,
concluded to this purpose; 
My Kingdom and all
my Treasures are yours; but vvhat I recommend
to you I likevvise deliver you, The old Lavvs and


Chronicles of the Countrey, our vvritten Senten∣ces
and VVisdom are inclosed in this Cabinet, the
principal Ievvels of my Crovvn are likevvise in
it; receive them all as they deserve, for they are
mine, and vvere highly valued by your fore-Fa∣thers.

The Jewels which were accounted in∣estimable,
are these following; whereof he
gave to his eldest Son, Emperor of Japan,



A crooked Sable, called 
Jeiuky Massamme.


Another Sable called 
Samoys.


Another less called 
Bungo Doyssero.


A Pot called 
Naraissiba.


A great t'Siapol called 
Stengo.


A Manuscript called 
Anckocky kindo.


To his Brother King of 
Ouvvay
 and 
At∣stanomia,


A Picture called 
Darme,
 to be vievved
backvvards.


A Sable called 
Massamme.


To his second Brother King of 
Kinokouny,
A Sable called
 Jees Messamme.


A Picture of 
Frogs.


To his third Brother King of 
Mito.


A Sable called 
Sandamme.


A Manuscript called 
Seuche.




These six pieces bestowed on the three Bro∣thers
are but of little worth, in comparison of
the six other given the Emperor, and yet they
are valued at a thousand gold 
Oebans,
 that is


forty seven Teylens a piece. The Silver and
Gold which his Majesty gave to the Princes of
his blood, to several of his favorite Kings, their
Wives, his companion Lords, his Soldiers and
Gentlemen amounted upon account to above
Thirty Millions sterling.


The present Emperor being after his Fathers
decease in full and peaceable possession of the
Government, had as then no lawful Wife, be∣ing
much given to Sodomy, which moved the

Deyro
 to send him two beautiful Ladies, (of
his own kindred, and every way accomplished)
with a desire that he would be pleased to chuse
one of them, that best pleased him, for his 
Mi∣dia

or Empress. He did indeed consent to the

Deyros
 request, but followed his old way of
living; so that the young Lady, being destitute
of the conversation she might reasonably ex∣pect,
was extreamly afflicted, although she
durst not let it appear for fear of her Husband's
displeasure. At length her Foster-Mother (a
Lady of great credit, both in respect of her age,
and in that she had bred up so great a Princess)
finding the Emperor one day in a good humor,
adventured, though very submissively, to speak
to him in behalf of her Mistris; which she did
as followeth. 
Hovv is it possible that your Ma∣jesties
affections should be carried avvay vvith
such unnatural pleasures, and that so beautiful a


Creature as your ovvn Handmaid, vvho vvould
rejoice you in bearing another like to your Self,
should be forgotten, certainly she ought to be pre∣ferred.

The Tyrant, though till now in his fro∣licks,
grew angry, yet said nothing; but rising
up retired immediatly: and sending for all the
Overseers of his Buildings, commanded them
forthwith to begin and build him a Castle, with
high Walls, Moats, Bridges, and strong Gates;
as also to adorn it within with all manner of
necessary and sumptuous appertainments and
Lodgings. The work being finished with
more then ordinary haste, the beautiful Queen,
her Foster-Mother, and all that train of young
Ladies which she brought with her from 
Mia∣ko,

were put into it, where she is kept without
the sight of men, and intirely forsaken of her
Husband. The Emperor's own Foster-Mo∣ther,
who was likewise in great esteem and
respect as his own Mother, being much trou∣bled
at this action of his Majesty, and seeing he
had no Children, neither was like to have any
whilst he lived thus, sent into the several Coun∣tries
in his Dominions to search out the most
charming beauties that could be found; which
done, she disposes of them in such manner, that
his Majesty insensibly had the sight of them all;
among the rest there was a slight maid, an Ar∣morers
Daughter, who did so far please him,


and gain upon his affections, that he lay with
her. The great Ladies of the Court, seeing an
Artificers Girl preferred before them all, mad
with jealousie and rage, resolved to strangle
her Childe in its birth, which they cruelly
performed; but have hitherto kept the know∣ledg
of so black a deed from the Emperor, fear∣ing
his just indignation and revenge.


The Japan Chronicles write, that this great
Kingdom hath, until this hundred years, been
still governed by an Hereditary Prince, which
they call 
Deyro,
 who was in such reverence
with the people, that never any tumults or civil
broils were raised against his Person or Autho∣rity:
He was esteemed so Sacred, that to op∣pose
him was judged no less criminal then to
fight against the Gods; both being inexpiable.
When any difference arose betwixt his subject-Kings,
so that they armed each against other,
there was a 
Generalissimo
 appointed to mediate
their quarrels, and punish, if need were, the
offending or transgressing Prince: For the 
Dey∣ros

themselves were esteemed so holy, that they
never trod upon the ground; neither was the
Sun or Moon ever suffered to shine upon them;
nothing of their Body was diminished or pair∣ed
off, their hair, beard and nails being suffered
to grow at length: When they did eat, their
meat was still dressed in new pots, and served


up in new dishes. They have twelve married
Wives apiece, who are severally honored and
brought with various ceremonies to this height
and state: When the 
Deyro
 goes abroad, he is
followed with these twelve Women, each in
her Coach, adorned with her Arms and Titles;
these have their Houses and Trains apart, all in
the 
Deyro
's Palace, built in rows, six on a side,
very magnificent, and beautified (as the Coach∣es)
with their Names, Arms and Titles. The
Concubines dwell likewise by themselves. Sup∣per
is provided every evening in every one of
these twelve Houses, with voices and instru∣ments,
though none knows who shall be ho∣nored
with the 
Deyro
's company. Where the

Deyro
 enters, the banqueting and provision of
the other eleven Houses is immediatly brought
thither; the other eleven Wives following
with their Ladies and Musick, to divert and
make merry with her whom the 
Deyro
 thinks
at present worthy of his conversation: They
have their Comedies likewise, and such other
pastimes as befit so splendid an entertainment.


When the 
Deyro
 is blessed with a Son, the
hoped Successor of that Empire, a Nurse is
chosen for him out of eighty of the loveliest
Women of the Country, young and Noble
Wives to Persons of great quality and birth:
These Women are honored and received by the



Deyro
's twelve Wives, and all his Women, as
also those nine principal Lords who are of his
blood and kindred, and next the inheritance
in case he have no issue male, with extraordinary
ceremonies and feasting. The following day
forty are chosen out of the fourscore, the
which, the number decreasing, are entertained
more honorably then before; the day being
spent in usual and pompous diversions, the re∣cited
forty retain the Titles and Dignities of
Foster-Mothers, but are dismissed from further
attendance, though not without gifts and rich
presents. Ten are again chosen out of the re∣maining
forty; out of these ten three; and last∣ly,
out of these three one; in all which electi∣ons
the honors, ceremonies and presents are
successively heightned. Three days after the
last chosen Nurse is again highly entertained;
which being done, the milk is pressed out of
her brests into the Childes mouth, (which all
this while is held by one of the noblest Ladies
of the Court;) which ceremony done, the
Nurse is as then esteemed worthy to take that
Childe into her custody, being it hath tasted of
her milk and substance.


The Ceremonies and Feasts of their Wed∣dings,
Childe-bearings, and those other which
they celebrate yearly, are performed with much
state and modest pomp, and are at this day in


use by the 
Deyro,
 who wants nothing, save
that the Land is governed by another; the
reason and history whereof we will briefly de∣clare.


The Office of Chief General was formerly
the first in the whole Kingdom, which or∣dinarily
was conferred upon the 
Deyro
's se∣cond
Son; but having then another Son,
which, for the Mothers sake, he was willing
to advance, he divided this great charge be∣twixt
them, with command, that they should
govern each his three years by turn. This took
for some time, until one of them, having
tasted the sweetness of ruling, was loath to
quit so splendid an employment; he there∣fore
leagues with the great Lords of the Coun∣try,
and settles his power so fast, during his
Commission, that neither the commands and
entreaties of his Father, nor the violence of
his offended Brother, were able to remove
him: Yet this being a business of so ill and
so great consequence, and like to embroil
the Kingdom in disorders, the 
Deyro
 resolved
to chastise his rebellious Son; which, by the
assistance of his Kings, and the valour of his
former General, he did. And this was the be∣ginning,
and the first intestine war that ever
happened against the 
Deyro
's State and Au∣thority.



The aforesaid General being for his good
service continued in his command, ordered his
business so well, that after his Majesties death
he made himself Lord of his inheritance, usurp∣ing
the Government of the Kingdom wholly
into his hands; leaving yet the 
Deyra
's Court
in its former state and greatness, (his Successor
to his Revenue) and commanding he should
be used in all things with the same respect and
ceremony as before. These proceedings pro∣duced
another War, another General being
chosen; who having overthrown the former,
usurped to himself what he had condemned in
his Predecessor, the Soveraignity of the whole
Land; which occasioned a third intestine War
more cruel and more destroying then the other
two: For now the Kings and Governors of
Provinces began to set up each for himself, so
that the Countrey was well nigh ruined (Town
being against Town, and City against City)
by these dissenting Grandees: During these
troubles it fell out that a bold active Fellow,
formerly a private Souldier, thinking it best
fishing in troubled waters, resolved to put in
for a share; Having therefore got together
forty or fifty Companions, as desperate as him∣self,
he in a little time, what with his good for∣tune
and good conduct, grew very numerous
and considerable, and having taken several


Castles and Towns, drove likewise all that
stood him out of the field; so that in less then
three years he became absolute and Soveraign
Lord of the whole Kingdom. He, as the other
Usurpers, left the 
Deyro
 in quiet possession of
all he formerly enjoyed (except the Govern∣ment)
which he held himself; and was after∣wards,
by the said 
Deyro,
 (unable to vindicate
his own right) acknowledged and crowned
Emperor of Japan with unimaginable pomp
and magnificence.


This Emperor, whose name was 
Taycko,

being no less prudent then brave, fearing lest the
great Lords of his Kingdom, reflecting upon
the lowness of his former condition might
contemn his present Authority, as disdaining
to be governed by one less then themselves,
thought it best to keep them in action, the bet∣ter
to divert them from caviling a new; he there∣fore
sent those Kings and Chiefs, that he feared
most, with an Army of sixty thousand Men,
to war against 
Corea,
 and reduce that Country
to the obedience of the 
Iapan
 Empire. These
he held there with kinde messages, and reite∣rated
promises of succours seven whole years,
commanding they should not return till they
had subdued and made conquest of all: But
the Army longing for their Country, their
Wives and Children, and despairing of a re∣turn,


mutined; and destroying, burning, and
plundering all they could meet, endeavoured
the satisfaction of their pretended wrongs by
the desolation of others. The 
Coreans,
 unable
to endure this violence any longer, sent an
Ambassador to the Emperour 
Taycko,
 who,
being admitted into his Court, found means
to take away his life by poison, in revenge of
the manifold wrongs his Country had suffered
by the injurious ambition of this Prince. The
Kings and Lords, commanding the Army in

Corea,
 hearing of their Emperor's death, re∣solved
to quit that Country, and to return eve∣ry
one to his own, in expectation and hopes
who amonst them might be chosen to succeed
in the Soveraignty.


The Emperor being removed, left one only
Son behinde him, called 
Fideri,
 about six
years of age; but before he died he appointed
him a Governor, one of the greatest Lords
of his Country, by name 
Ongoschio;
 one whom
he had obliged by his favors, and relied upon
above all others for his fidelity: To this Person
he delivered his Infant-Son, with command,
that when he was fifteen years of age, he should
cause him to be crowned by the 
Deyro,
 with
the usual Pomps and Ceremonies, as Emperor
of 
Iapan. Ongoschio
 being thus declared Go∣vernor
of the Princes Person, was likewise by



Taycko
's will, and the consent of his Subject-Kings,
made Regent of the Kingdom during
the minority, which for some time he peace∣ably
ruled in his Master's name: But growing
now weary of subordination, he quickly for∣got
his promise made to 
Taycko,
 and sealed
with his blood; 
Fideri
 being therefore to be
removed, to make place for his greatness, he
assaulted him first in his reputation, by laying
those things to his charge he was no way guilty
of; amongst others, he accused him of distrust
of his Tutor, and that he made private prepa∣rations
to extort the Government out of his
hands by force, before his time; he laid like∣wise
ambition, and an untimely desire of ho∣nor
to his charge, in that he suffered himself to
be adored as Emperor before he was invested
with the Power; and that the Kings and Lords
of the Realm, had done him that reverence
which was only due to a received Emperor.
But armed ambition needs not many excuses,

Ongoschio
 musters his united forces in the King∣dom
of 
Surnga,
 and marching thence to 
On∣sacka,

where 
Fideri
 held his Court, besieged
him with all his might. 
Fideri,
 having held out
three moneths, being now reduced to great
extremity, would prevent his ruine by a sordid
submission; he therefore sent to 
Ongoschio
 to
beg his life, quitting all his pretence to the


Empire, and desiring only to survive a Vassal
to the Conqueror. But 
Ongoschio
 refused all
manner of capitulation; and though 
Fideri
 sent
out his Wife, who was his Adversaries Daugh∣ter,
to supplicate his safety, she could not be
heard of her Father. The Castle being taken,
the Palace where 
Fideri
 had retired himself,
with his Mother and chief Friends, was en∣compassed
with great posts and pallisadoes,
and much wood being piled up about it, the
unfortunate Prince, and all them that were
with him, were miserably burnt and consumed
with sire. 
Ongoschio
 having thus destroyed his
Master, put all them to death who were con∣siderable,
and of his party; bringing the whole
Empire under his obedience by force, as 
Tayc∣ko

had done before him. The year following

Ongoschio
 died, not enjoying long what his
violence had so quickly got him, his Son 
Coubo,

or 
Coubosanna,
 succeeded him, who was Father
to this present Emperor 
Chiongon,
 now reign∣ing.








The number of his Souldiers,
and their Arms.


THe Revenue which is divided amongst
the Kings and governing Lords, amounts
(as is already demonstrated) to 18400000
Coquyns, or Pounds sterling; according to
which account, each of them must, propor∣tionably,
entertain a select company of Soul∣diers,
always in readiness for the Emperor's
service; so that he who hath a thousand Co∣quyns
yearly, must bring into the field, when
ever he is commanded, twenty Foot Souldiers
& two Horse-Men. Thus the Lord of Fiarmor,
who hath 60000 Coquyns a year, must enter∣tain,
as he easily may, one thousand two hundred
Foot, and one hundred and twenty Horse, be∣sides
Servants, Slaves, and what more is neces∣sary
for the Train. The number therefore of
Souldiers, which the Emperor hath continu∣ally
in service, entertained by the aforesaid
Kings and Lords, amount to three hundred
sixty eight thousand Foot, and thirty six thou∣sand
eight hundred Horse. Besides these his
Majesty hath one hundred thousand Foot, and
twenty thousand Horse, which he paies out of
his own Revenue, and keeps for the Garrison∣ing


of his Castles and Forts, and the securing
of his own Person. Most of the Lords, espe∣cially
the most powerful, do ordinarily keep
double the number of Souldiers, and many
more then they are obliged to by their tax;
and all to out vie each other, and the better to
ingratiate themselves with their common Ma∣ster,
as hath appeared at large in the late War.
The Horse-Men are all harnassed, though the
Foot have no other defensive arms then a Head∣piece;
the Horse are armed, some with short
Guns, some with short Pikes, others with
Bows and Arrows, and all with Swords or
Sables. The Foot have likewise Sables, Pikes,
and Halberts, and those that are divided into
Companies Fire-Arms: every five Souldiers
have their Commander armed as they are; five
of these Chiefs have likewise those who com∣mand
them; and their five and twenty, and
twice twenty five, make a compleat Company,
commanded by two Heads, who, with their
fifty, are commanded by a Captain in chief:
five of these ordinary Companies are again
commanded by another; and fifty Companies
have likewise their principal Officer; the same
method and order being held under the Horse.
His Majesty may easily and exactly know how
many living souls, how many Souldiers, and
how many Citizens he hath in his whole King∣dom;





Manie
e van Justitie in Jappon.





for the Houses being built by five and
five, and every five having their Commander
who must register all them that are born and
die within their Jurisdiction, and report the
same to their Lords, who again are obliged to
tell it their Kings, and they to two Officers
appointed by the Emperor for that purpose.






The Authority of his Councel∣lors
and Vassals.


THe Senators, or Councellors, hath each
his Office apart, excepting only four, who
are the principal and chief Ministers of State;
these come dayly to Court, and dispatch all
Publick Affairs by his Majesties directions;
and are (as likewise the other minor Senators)
highly respected and honored by the subordi∣nate
Kings and Lords: The chief of these have
two hundred thousand pounds a year, the mid∣dle
half so much, and the lesser thirty, twenty,
and ten thousand pounds 
per An.
 Their Au∣thority
and Power is confined to the Empe∣ror's
Pleasure, none of them (upon pain of
Banishment or worse) daring to advise a second
time, after Answer once received from the
Prince. His Majesty chuses these his Councel∣lors
out of those Gentlemen that have served


well and long, having been bred up in the
Court with him, and had the address to please
him most. All the Affairs of the Kingdom pass
these mens hands; but they are very circum∣spect
in observing his Majesties eye and plea∣sure,
before they adventure to propose advice
or answer, and all to continue in his good grace
and favour; nay, they are fo fearfully slavish,
that they approve of whatever the Prince pro∣poses,
and though the ruine of a Province de∣pended
upon it, will not seem to have senti∣ments
differing from his.






The quality of his Princes and
Lords, and their might.


THe Revenues of the commanding Lords,
as appears by their specifications, are very
great, and yet they have, by reason of their
vast expences, enough to do with their mo∣neys:
First, they are obliged, though never so
far distant from Court, to reside six moneths
every year in the City of 
Jedo,
 to wait upon
the Emperor. Those of the North and East
come one half year, which being expired, they
are relieved by them of the South and West;
who depart with his Majesties leave, after much
Ceremony, Feasting, and receiving of Presents


back to their several Countries. Thus they
take their turns at Court, which is infinite ex∣pensive,
by reason of their numerous trains,
some of them travelling to and fro with one,
two, three, four, five, and six thousand men.
The Lord of 
Firando,
 (where our East-India-Company
hath a Lodge) being but one of the
least among them, travels with three hundred
Men, Gentlemen and others; and hath in his
two Houses at 
Iedo
 above a thousand Persons,
Men and Women. Thus each Lord lives ac∣cording
to his Means and Dignity, rather pro∣fuse
then sparing; so that the City swarms with
Men and Attendance, which makes the Mar∣kets
high and very dear. Their sumptuous
Buildings, their gorgeous Cloathing of their
Servants, especially their Women and their
Attendants, their Feasts, their Presents, and
other extraordinary Expences of that proud
and pompous Court, do sufficiently keep un∣der
these great Men; for their Charges sur∣mount
their Revenues, and they are found most
commonly to be much behinde hand. Besides
all this his Majesties orders, the making of se∣veral
publick Buildings, as High-Ways, Chan∣nels,
Castles, and the like, all which are divided
amongst the aforesaid Lords then at Court,
each his share; which they cause to be made,
without respect of expence, to the envy of


each other, with all speed and industry imagi∣nable.
The chief Lords when they build new
Palaces for themselves, do besides the ordinary
Gates and Doors, cause another great and
sumptuous Port to be made, beautified with
Statues, and wrought all with hard Wax, or
Indian Lack, and richly guilt. This Entry being
finished, it is covered all over with Plancks,
to keep the Sun and Rain from it; and conti∣nueth
so inclosed and shut up, until such time
as the Emperour honours that House with his
presence: After his Majesty hath passed and
re-passed through the said Gate, it is wholly
shut up and never opened more; no man be∣ing
afterwards found worthy to go in or out
at that Door, which hath been graced with the
Princes entry. His Majesty doth go but once
to feast in one House, all the preparations for
his entertainment being made ready long be∣fore,
with great care and cost; every thing be∣ing
adorned with his Arms, and afterwards
never used more, but preserved with great de∣votion,
in remembrance that the Emperour
did vouchsafe to eat in that House. His Ma∣jesty
is always invited three years before hand,
in which time the preparations fit for so royal
a Guest are making. After the Emperour hath
been there one day, the Princes of his blood,
his Councellors, and the Kings and great Lords


are treated with incredible magnificence three
whole Moneths together. Briefly, the building
of such a Palace, and the treating of so great a
Prince, is sufficient to make a rich King poor;
and yet these ruinning profusions are not to be
avoided. When his Majesty goes a Hern-hunt∣ing,
and hath taken some of those Birds, being
of great esteem in those Countries, he some∣times
bestows one of them upon one Favorite
or other; which Present costs the Receiver
at least a half years Revenue: for the Gift is so
highly valued, having been taken by the Em∣peror's
Hawks, and given with his own hands,
that the whole City seems to partake of the joy,
it being abundantly testified by Feasting and
Presents.


The Lord of 
Satsuma
 had lately the honour
to entertain the Emperour in his new Palace,
but with better fortune then any of his greatest
Princes; for his Majesty was so well pleased
with his treatment, that he made him a Present
(of Beans, as he pleased to tearm it, for his
Horses) worth threescore thousand Pounds a
year.


The Emperor disposes of the marriages of
his great Lords, who entertain their Wives
which are ordered them by him with extraor∣dinary
carresings; they receive and lodge them
in their best Palaces, and allow them ten, twen∣ty,


&c. to a hundred and more Gentle women
and Maid-Servants, according to their abilities,
to wait upon them, when they go abroad to
visit their Friends, which is allowed but once
a year. Their Women follow them in shut
Pallacquins, forty or fifty in number, each of
them with two Chamber-Maids, on each side
of their Pallacquins one. These Pallacquins
are very richly made, wrought with Lack and
inlaid with Gold, carried some nine foot from
each other in good order, with great modesty.
The Wife that is given by the Emperor, is the
Mother of those Children which succeed in
their Father's honors; but if she prove Childe∣less,
or have no Heir male, the Kingdom, or
Government, is ordinarily bestowed upon a
Stranger to that Race and Family. Every Lord
may have as many Concubines as he pleases,
or can maintain, whereby Children indeed are
multiplied, though none inherit but those that
are legitimate. These Lords enjoy all the plea∣sures
they can imagine, in the fruition of their
Women, Houses, Gardens, Ponds, Walks,
Musick, Plays, and the like. They suffer no
Men to come into their Wives Houses upon
any pretence whatsoever, unless it be some few
who are next of blood, and that but very sel∣dom;
these are kept close and careful; and all
their Women, young and old, great and of


lower condition, must thus spend their time,
without any manner of conversation with men;
the least suspition is punisht with death; it be∣ing
no less criminal to be thought ill, then to be
really so. These Attendants are choice Maids,
bred up in an humble and honest manner, and
so observant of their Master and Lady, that
they neither speak nor smile, but as they are
directed by their eye or motion. They are
clothed in Silks of several colours, and distin∣guished
into several orders; some wear red
vestments, with green girdles and green head∣tires;
others yellow, with violet girdles and
tires; others white, with red girdles and tires;
and others, other such colours as they best fan∣cy,
most embroydered with Gold. Every order
hath its Officers, consisting ordinarily of six∣teen
Persons, who are seated according to their
quality, and served according to the custom
of their Country. Those young Persons are
all of Noble Extraction, fair, well bred, and
not entertained into this service for less time
then twenty years; some, nay most, for their
whole lives. Many are received into service at
the age of four or five and twenty, some at the
age of twenty eight or thirty; and are bestow∣ed
in marriage by their Lords, upon some of
their Gentlemen, or Officers, according to
their merit; whom he then honours with an


increase of stipend, besides present sums of
money. Those who arrive to the age of above
thirty years in their service, do ordinarily spend
their whole lives there, being preferred to
Offices under their Ladies. All the married
Women, of what quality soever, are trained
up by such rules, that they busie not themselves
with the affairs of this life, or trouble their
Husbands with unnecessary questions or de∣sires,
to avoid harsh returns, which are the
consequences of any demands of that kinde,
when ever the Husbands visit their Wives,
which is never but for their own diversion;
they divest themselves of all sorts of business,
not resuming the consideration of it till they
quit the place, where the whole treatment is en∣tirely
relating to what is amorous, as Banquets,
Musick, Dancing, Plays, and the like, wherein
the Women have an extraordinary dexterity
and address in pleasing their Husbands. The
reason they give (especially the great Ones)
why their Wives are kept thus retired, and se∣questred
from the company of Men and busi∣ness,
is first, as they say, Because the Woman
is to serve the Man, to divert him, to bring
him Children, to give them education, and for
no other end; further, to avoid jealousie and
its consequences, of vexation, blood and war,
which they have gathered from former expe∣rience,


when their Women had more liberty;
as also from tragical examples, recorded in their
Histories, of divers who have been deceived
and ruined by them. Their Women are or∣dinarily
true and modest, even to blushing,
whereof I shall instance an example or two:
There was in the Kingdom of Fingo a Person
of quality, who had a Wife of extraordinary
beauty; the King caused him to be secretly
murthered, and after some time sent for his
Lady to Court: She obayed; but knowing
her Husband was made away by his practices,
answered his importunities in these words;
Mighty Prince, I ought in reason to rejoyce
and account my self extream happy, in being
thought worthy to serve your Majesty; yet
permit me to affirm, that at the same instant
you approach me, I will kill my self; but if you
shall please to grant what I shall desire of you,
I will give my self up to be your humble Hand∣maid:
Allow me then the respite of thirty
days, wherein I may mourn for my Husband,
and cause him to be interred according to his
Dignity; after which, that I may, upon the
Tower of your Castle, make a Feast for my
Husband's Friends, with them to put an end
to my mourning. The King condiscended to
this request; but wondred at the curiosity of
it. The Ceremony being performed, at which


the King was present, and in a good humour,
well heated with wine and his passions) the
Lady withdrew to the side of the Gallery, as
if she would have reposed, and upon a sud∣den
threw her self over the walls, and broke
her neck, in the presence of the King and those
that were with him.


The other is of a certain Lord, who sent
about through his dominions for some young
Gentlewomen to attend upon his Lady; and
amongst others found a poor Widows Daugh∣ter,
who was so acceptable to her Lord, that
he received her into the number of his Con∣cubines.
Her Mother being reduced to great
wants, wrote a Letter to her, wherein she at
large set forth her poverty, and the miserable∣ness
of her condition. While the Daughter
was busie in reading of it, her Lord comes in,
and she endeavouring to hide the Letter, he
perceived it, and in great choler would know
what the Letter was, from whom and from
whence it came? she, ashamed to discover
the poverty of her Mother, refused to tell him;
whereupon he endeavored to force it from her,
which she to prevent, put it into her mouth,
and would have swallowed it; but not being
able to get it down, it stuck in her throat and
choaked her. The Lord, mad with rage and
jealousie, caused her immediatly to be cut up,


to search for the Letter; but finding the inno∣cency
of it, and that it contained only the dis∣covery
of her Mothers poverty, was so trans∣ported
with grief and sorrow, that he could
not refrain his tears; and in the sense of it, sent
for his Concubines Mother, who at this pre∣sent
lives in the house with him, in much honor
and esteem. The modesty of these females
extends to their private conversation, so that
they are very careful, even in the presence of
their next of kindred, not to let fall any word
which may savour of the least lightness or in∣continency;
not daring to speak of marriage,
though lawful, nor the way to it; and if any
unseemly discourse, though but in appearance,
should happen, the youngest arise immediatly
and quit the company.


They honour and love their Parents even to
devotion, believing firmly, that those who
do the contrary, cannot escape the vengeance
of the Gods; this piety extends to them that
gave them their lives after their death; the ani∣versary
of their decease being ceremoniously
observed, by their abstaining upon that day
from eating any thing that hath life or motion.


But to return from whence we digressed;
the Revenue of the governing Lords is diverse
and various; some Countries produce Corn
and Fruit, others Gold and Silver; some again


Brass, Iron, Tin, Lead, and others again cu∣rious
Manufactures, Hemp, Cotton, Silk,
and the like; all which are calculated, valued,
and perfectly known to the Emperor.


These ruling Princes have each of them a
Chancellor, imposed by the Emperour, pre∣sented
ordinarily with this following comple∣ment:

Sir, your Government is great, and your
Subjects are many; and therefore I have thought
fit, out of the care I have of your good, to ap∣point
you an Assistant, being a person wise and
trusty, bred up under my eyes, and in my house;
employ therefore his services, and let it not be
unacceptable to you that we study your welfare.

This person is received with great thanks, ce∣remony,
feasting and presents; and (though an
open Spie upon his Master's actions,) treated
with much honour and respect. These Chan∣cellors
are men knowing in affairs, and such
as the Emperor absolutely confides in. The
more to ensure them to his interest, he causes
them not only to promise and swear, but to
sign like wise with their bloods, that they shall
take exact account of every particular, great
and small, that may concern the State; and also
keep a dayly account, or Diary, of their Lords
lives and actions, and send the same over to
him by expresses. None of the Kings or Lords
can or may do any thing of themselves, the





Afbeelding van's Keysers Pa
e
s, mitsgadees de manier van't ver
enen syner Aud





Government of their Territories and Affairs
being at the disposal of these men, as their
principal Ministers.


Most of these Lords entertain alwaies by
them some choice Persons for parts and under∣standing,
only to observe their actions, and
tell them of their faults; which they must ex∣actly
do without respect or flattery, for they
say, no man can see his own errours so well as
another, especially those who are called to go∣vern,
as more subject to the transports of pas∣sion
and pride, they had therefore rather hear
of their faults by their trusty Servants to cor∣rect
them, then to be ill spoken of behind their
backs; and for this reason these secret Moni∣tors
are alwaies near their Lords persons, espe∣cially
at Feasts and publique meetings, obser∣ving
their words and least actions. These
Lords though they have their particular names,
yet they are ordinarily called by that of their
Government or residence; further every man
hath three names, the children a childish, when
they are men a more manly, and being become
old get others suitable to the decays of nature
and age: The surnames are first pronounced,
for being their parents were before them, they
think it but reasonable that their names should
likewise precede. When one of these Lords
die, ten, twenty, or thirty of his Vassals kill


themselves to bear him company: many that
do so, oblige themselves to it during their
Lords lives; for having received some more
then ordinary grace and favour from him, and
fancying themselves better beloved then their
companions, they think it a shame to survive
their Benefactour; and therefore in return of
their thanks they usually add, 
My Lord, the
number of your faithful Slaves is great, but
what have I done to merit this honour? this Body,
which is indeed yours, I offer you again, and pro∣mise
it shall not live longer then yours; I will not
survive so worthy a Patron.
 For confirmation
of this they drink a bowl of Wine together,
which is solemn; for no covenants thus made
are to be broken. Those that thus binde them∣selves
cut their own bellies, and do it as fol∣loweth:
They assemble their nearest kindred,
and going to Church, they celebrate the part∣ing
feast upon mats and carpets in the midst of
the Plain, where having well eat and drank,
they cut up their bellies, so that the guts and
entrails burst out; and he that cuts himself
highest, as some do even to the throat, is count∣ed
the bravest fellow, and most esteemed. If
the Lord cause a wall to be built, either for the
King or himself, his Servants often times beg
they might have the honour to lie under, out
of a belief, that what is founded upon a living


mans flesh, is subject to no misfortune: This
request being granted, they go with joy un∣to
the designed place, and lying down there,
suffer the foundation stones to be laid upon
them, which with their weight, immediately
bruise and shiver them to pieces.


His Majesty hath several Castles strong and
great, whereof those of 
Osaua
 and 
Iedo
 are
the most magnificent. The Countries belong∣ing
to the Kings and great Lords, are not much
travelled by our Nation, so that we have no
knowledg of them; only I am informed that
they have mighty Towns and Castles: None
of these Cities are walled, though their streets
are regular every one, and equally long; the
ends of them shut with Gates, and guarded
with Watchmen by night or times of danger.
The Country waies are marked at every miles
end with stones or stakes, being put up for
that purpose. In their Towns and Villages
every street hath two Magistrates, who take
care for their precinct, and must give an
account for whatever happens in them; and
because none through clownishness, or other∣wise,
may approach the Lord Governour
with disrespect, they have Prolocutors ap∣pointed
them, by whose intervention all lesser
matters are compassed, the more difficult be∣ing
reserved for the decision of the ordinary
Judge.








Their manner of Justice.


THe Cities and Towns have no revenue
at all, each of them depending on their
Lord; neither have the Citizens, Marchants,
Gentry or Commonalty any Tolls, Excise,
or Contributions; they pay likewise nothing,
except it be for the ground their houses stand
upon, which is the Lords; and for that they
give from forty shillings to two yearly, ac∣cording
to the greatness of their houses. E∣very
house must finde a man upon occasion,
which happeneth three or four times a year,
though but for an hour, and sometimes for
half a day or so. The King, or Lord, hath
the whole product of the Land and Sea; the
Gentlemen and Souldiers live upon that por∣tion
their Lord assigns them out of the Coun∣try;
the Marchant subsists by his gaine; the
Citizens and Artificers by their trades; and
the Labourers by that portion which their
Lord allows them out of the fruit of the earth.








What Crimes they punish
most severely.


EVery individual, from the Emperour to
the meanest Gentleman, hath the right of
Justice over his Subjects and Servants. His
Majesty hath his ordinary Judges in all his Ci∣ties
and Towns. When a Gentleman, or
Souldier, is condemned to die, he is allowed
the honour to kill himself, by cutting up his
belly with his own hands; whereas the Citi∣zen,
Marchant, and meaner persons, suffer by
the common Executioner. A Marchant, how
rich soever, is not esteemed at all, because
they say, He liveth by his lying, making no
conscience to cousen and deceive the People
for his filthy lucre sake: The Citizen and Ar∣tificer
are likewise undervalued, because they
are but Servants to the Commonalty, and for∣ced
to live by their labours and manufactures:
Neither are the Country People of more ac∣count,
because of the miserableness of their
condition, being subject to perpetual slavery
and toyling. But the Gentlemen and Soul∣diers,
who are numerous, are honoured and
feared; and they do nothing, being maintained
and served by the Marchants, by the Citizens,


and by the Country Labourers. Every crime,
how small soever, is punished with death;
especially theft, although but to the value of
a penny; gaming, and playing for money, is
no less hainous then murther: and all other
Delinquents which deserve the rigour of Ju∣stice
with us in Europe, undergo the same pe∣nalty
here. Every one suffers for his own
faults, except the matter be treasonable, and
then the Father, Brothers and Sons must like∣wise
suffer, and their goods be confiscated;
and the Mothers, Sisters, and Daughters be
given away and sold for slaves. These con∣fiscations
are not due to the Emperour, King,
or Lord in whose Territories they happen,
but are reserved under account for publick
uses, as building of Churches, making of
Bridges, repairing of High-waies, and the
like.


It happened in my time, that a proud fellow
presented his service to a poor Gentleman,
demanding of him, by reason of his address
and parts, more wages then he knew the Gen∣tleman
could give; who vexed at the youths
impertinencies, and perceiving he jeered him,
replied with a composed countenance, 
Friend,
you demand indeed much wages, but being I
think you will deserve it, and that you are plea∣sing
in my eyes, I am content to receive you into


my service.
 Three daies after his Master sent
him on an errand; being returned, he was ac∣cused
for staying out so long, so as no excuses
would save his life; being forced to pay for
his insolency under this colourable pretence.
The Lord of 
Finando
 did lately cause three
Gentlewomen of his Ladies attendants, to be
shut up in Chests spiked with nails on every
side, because one of them had had some con∣versation
with a certain Gentleman, (who was
likewise condemned to die, and his belly cut
up) and that the other two, knowing of their
companions practices, had not discovered
them. Who ever findes his Wife in a lockt
or shut chamber with another man, may law∣fully
kill them both; the which, though very
rarely, hath indeed happened: If the Husband
be absent, then his Father, Brother, Son, or
next of kin, nay a Servant may do it; so that
Adultery is seldom or never heard of amongst
them. A certain Gentleman, being jealous
of his Wife, pretended a journey from home;
but returning unexpectedly back, found ano∣ther
Man with his Wife in the chamber; trans∣ported
with jealousie and revenge, he instant∣ly
kills the amased Gallant, and binding his
Wife to a ladder, let her stand there thus
chained all night. Next morning he sent to in∣vite
all his and her kindred, Men and Women,


to dinner; which however contrary to their
customs, each sex feasting and eating alwaies
apart, was through his importunity assented
unto. The Women, who sat in a chamber
by themselves, ignorant of what had happen∣ed,
enquired often for the Lady of the house;
to which her Husband made answer, that she
was busie in ordering their entertainment,
she would wait upon them immediatly. The
Guests being all sat, Men and Women toge∣ther,
and dinner half done, the Husband
went and cut off the privities of his slain Ri∣val,
and putting them into a covered Box of
Lack, or Wax, deckt with flowers, unbound
his Wife, and clothing her in a winding sheet,
with her hair loose and hanging over her
shoulders, gave it her, she not knowing what
was in it, adding, 
Go and carry it to our Friends
at dinner, and try whether for their sakes I may
not pardon you also.
 The poor Woman, half
dead and distracted with fear, did as her Hus∣band
commanded her, and entering in this
dreadful posture, fell on her knees before the
company, and opened the Box, at sight where∣of
she sunk down in a swound, and being
close followed by her Husband, had her head
immediatly struck off by him; at which hor∣rid
sight the afrighted Guests ran all out of
the house.



Those faults which are accounted crimi∣nal
amongst them, are the breaking of the
Emperours commands and orders; Peculati∣on,
or robbing his Majesties Revenues; false
coyning, burning of houses, rapes, and the ill
governing of those in Authority; he that is
guilty of any of these crimes, is punished in
his person and posterity; if it be a Woman
that hath offended, she suffers alone; nor shall
she die for anothers sin, only be given away
or sold. Their punishments are rosting,
burning, crucifying both waies, drawing with
four Bulls, and boyling in Oyl and Water. A
man who was to deliver Wood and Stone to
his Majesties Factours, had corrupted some
Souldiers and others appointed for the ser∣vice;
this being discovered, the Overseers
were ordered to cut up their bellies; but the
Marchant was crucified with his heels upward.
This man, being a man of parts, was in good
esteem with the Councellors and great ones
at Court, and however it be, that it is not
lawful to intercede for a criminal, yet the a∣foresaid
Grandees, out of pity and affection
to the Delinquent, having consulted together,
adventured to supplicate his Majesty in his be∣half;
whereupon they received this follow∣ing
answer. 
I have understood your desires
with wonder; but that which troubles me most


is, that the unreasonableness of the demands ob∣liges
me to suspect your judgements; shall not
the evil doer die? whence then proceedeth this
your request? or are your hearts likewise cor∣rupted
with gifts and gold? change your pur∣poses,
and let justice have her course, and then
if any amongst you desire riches, let them go to
my Treasure and satisfie themselves; go, I give
you full liberty to do it.
 This reply did so star∣tle
the Petitioners, that they retired, not da∣ring
to make any further instance, or speak one
word more.


They have a peculiar method in punishing
of crimes, which I will also relate: It hap∣pened
(as it did in my time) that a Gentleman,
appointed Governour of a Lordship near the
imperial City of 
Jedo,
 had forced his Tribu∣taries
to pay more then they were obliged to
by their ordinary Tax and Contributions,
with which surplus he had Lorded it for some
time; but this Exaction continuing, the In∣habitants
supplicated his Majesty for relief;
whereupon the Gentleman, together with
his whole race, were ordered to cut up their
bellies. The said Governour had a Brother
in the service of the King of 
Fingo,
 two hun∣dred
and forty Dutch miles Westward from

Jedo;
 an Uncle at Satsuma, twenty miles fur∣ther;
a Son in the service of King 
Kinocoumy;



another Son in the service of the King of 
Mas∣samme,

an hundred and ten miles Eastward;
a third Son with the Governour of the Impe∣rial
Castle of 
Inquano;
 with two Brothers
more, that were Souldiers in his Majesties
Guards at 
Jedo;
 his youngest Son was upon
extraordinary sollicitations bestowed upon a
Marchants Daughter, who was an only Child
and very rich: All these Persons, however
East and West distant from each other, died
in one day, and on the same hour; for Posts
were sent to all places where these unhappy
men did live, with orders to the Governours,
that they should cause them upon the eighth
day of the eighth Moneth, (the day limited
for their execution) when the Sun was in the
South, to cut up their bellies, according to
the usual manner; which was exactly perform∣ed.
The aforesaid Marchant, well known to
our Society, dwelt at 
Osaua,
 but died for grief;
and his Daughter, unwilling to survive her
Husband, would (if she had not been pre∣vented)
have killed her self; yet she could not
be hindred to destroy that life, which was but
loathsome to her after so dear a loss; for she
abstained wholly from eating, and expired
(concluding this fatal Tragedy with her own)
the eleventh day after. The People of this Na∣tion,
especially the Women, die with strange


constancy and assurance, without any the least
emotion of sorrow or weakness.


Lyes are likewise punished with death,
especially if told to Magistrates or Lords;
neither will any Master pardon that crime in
his Servant. These aforesaid manners of put∣ting
to death, belong to the Gentry, the Soul∣diers,
Marchants, Citizens and Peasants; but
the Kings and transgressing Lords are other∣wise
punished: There is a little Island, three
miles in compass, and distant forty two miles
from 
Jedo,
 called 
Faitsnichina,
 so still and en∣vironed
with rocks and precipices, that no
ships of burthen can approach it: it was at
first attempted in very calm weather by cer∣tain
desperate fellows, who climbing up those
rocks, made a shift to get on the tops of them;
and having pulled up with ropes materials and
necessary instruments for their purpose, fast∣ned
beams and strong posts in the rocks in such
wise, that by the help of pullies and ropes, and
strong hanging nets, they can winde the boats
up some fathoms out of the water, and so se∣cure
them against the tossing of the Sea; whose
least agitation throws them against the Island,
and dashes them in pieces, as it happened to
the loss of many a man before this expedient
was found. The Island it self is very stony
and barren, arable but in some few places;


it is hither that the offending Grandees are
banished, and close kept from all manner of
communication or correspondency from
without with strict guards of Souldiers, who
have their stations upon all the several corners
of the Island for that purpose: These Guards,
if winde and weather permit, are relieved e∣very
moneth precisely, at which time they
receive provision for themselves, as also for
the exiled, which is but a little Rice, a few
Beans, some Roots, and other such hard fare:
they lodg in little low hutches, which can∣not
protect them from either against the Sum∣mers
heat or Winters cold; and they must
work, and gather Silk from the Worms, which
are fed and kept there, as also card, spin, and
weave such a portion as is yearly ordered them
by their task-Masters.


In the year one thousand six hundred thirty
one, when his late Majesty died, all sorts of
Prisoners, under the obedience of the Japa∣nish
Empire, none excepted, were all (in
one day and hour) set at liberty, and money
given to those that were poor to begin the
world again with.








What Divine Service they use.


THis Nation is neither very superstitious
nor very devout; they seldom or never
pray; and such are counted for religious, who
go to Church once in a moneth; they some∣times
use the word 
Nammanda,
 which is the
name of one of their chiefest Deities. The
Priests preach ordinarily three times every
year, being only then attended by those of
his Sect; others of another belief, make use
of their Hermits in their sickness, who read
and mumble (as if they were possessed) their
Orisons for twenty four hours together over
the Patient, without being understood of any;
for all their Divinity, as well as their Physick,
are writ and printed in an elevated style, not
to be fathomed or comprehended but by the
learned.






What Churches they have.


THey have many Temples and Churches
dedicated to their Idols, every one of
them inhabited by their Priests, two, ten, or
twenty, according to their greatness and re∣venues.








VVhat Priests they entertain.


THeir Priests do but little, they read some∣times
before their Idols, and bury the
dead, who are most of them first burnt, their
ashes being afterwards committed to the earth
with their usual ceremonies.






VVhat Sects are prevalent a∣mong
them.


THey have twelve Sects in all; the Priests
of the first eleven eat nothing that hath
lived, nor may marry: when they offend by
transgressing their order, the Delinquent is
buried to the middle in the High-way, every
one that passeth, and is no Gentleman, being
obliged to give him a stroak in the neck with
a wooden saw, ready for the purpose; so that
the miserable Priest is two or three daies,
sometimes more, in this languishing con∣dition
before he can die. The twelfth Sect
is the most esteemed and most honourable of
all; their Priests marry, and they may eat of
what ever the sea or earth produces, accord∣ing
to their several appetites. This Sect, called

Icko,
 or 
Ickois,
 is the most superstitious of all,


and hath its Pope, or Head, respected and
served with the same honour with their Kings.
When this high Priest passeth through the
streets, carried in his 
Pallaquin,
 they of his
faith, worship and pray to him; and this in∣deed
is the richest and easiest order amongst
them, and most countenanced. Some of their
Churches are priviledged and endowed by the
Emperour, or Lords, in whose Territories
they stand; but the rest are maintained by the
common people: and as each particular man
amongst the Papists hath his particular ghostly
Father, so the Inhabitants here have theirs; as
also their Churches, which they assist with
their charity to the utmost of their powers.
Each of these twelve Sects hath its particular
Faith; some believe that the soul is immortal,
that the flesh is earth; and that the spirit of
man shall live in another world, happy or
miserable, according to what he hath done
in this. Others think that there is no such
thing as a separable soul, and that they need
fear nothing but the Executioner; they are
ignorant of the beginning and ending of na∣ture,
most of them fancying the world with∣out
beginning, and that it shall be eternal.
The best of these Sects make Taverns of their
Temples, which are most commonly built in
the pleasantest and best places, sumptuous,


and well planted with trees and orchards:
When the Inhabitants have a minde to rejoyce,
they assemble here, and in the presence of
their Gods, and company of their Priests,
(who are likewise good fellows) they de∣bauch
and do those extravagances, which are
the concomitants of excess and folly; com∣mon
whores are permitted to enter and dance,
the Priests themselves allowing of this jolity,
and a further use, so it be in secret of these
immodest females. I never heard that those
people trouble themselves to dispute or argue
in their religion; neither do they break their
heads in converting others to their opinions;
but leave every one to the freedom of his own,
as indifferent and reasonable, as being infused
into him by their Gods. Their Priests, as
well as many of the Gentry, are much given
to Sodomy, that unnatural passion, being
esteemed no sin, nor shameful thing amongst
them.








The persecution of the Romish
Christians.


THose of this Countrey which were con∣verted
to Christianity by the Romish
Clergy, were them only which were perse∣cuted;
At first they cut off their heads, and
afterwards crucified them, which seemed then
very severe; but when these cruel Idolaters
perceived that death was not formidable to
those martyred Christians, who went to their
executions with singing and dancing, as if
they courted their torments, and that the
great numbers of them that suffered did no
way discourage or diminish the remaining,
but rather strengthen and increase their mul∣titudes,
they resolved to break them by more
exquisite and sensible tortures, to this pur∣pose
they bound them to stakes, and rosted
them alive, destroying thousands after this
unsufferable manner: But seeing yet there was
no end, and that death in what shape soever
was not terrible enough to affright those re∣solved
Saints to an Apostacy, they intended
and practiced other more dreadful waies and
pains, for to oblige them to quit and change
their opinions and religion; they forced the


women and more tender maids to go upon
their hands and feet bowing, supporting and
dragging them naked in the presence of thou∣sands
through the streets; that done, they cau∣sed
them to bee ravished and lain with by Ruf∣fians
and Villains, and then th
wing them
so stript and abused, into great deep tubs full
of Snakes and Adders, which crept by several
passages into their bodies, suffered them to
perish after unspeakable miseries in that fear∣ful
manner: they thrust hurds into the Mo∣thers
privities, and binding the Sons about
with the same combustible matter, thrust and
forced them, as also the Fathers and Daugh∣ters,
to set fire each to other, whereby they
underwent unconceivable torments and pains:
some they clothed with sods, and pouring
hot scalding water continually upon them, tor∣tured
them in that manner till they died, which
dured two or three daies, according to the
strength of the party; hundreds of them be∣ing
stript naked, and burnt in the foreheads
that they might be known, were driven into
the Woods and Forrests, all men being com∣manded
by Proclamation, upon pain of death,
not to assist them with either meat, drink,
clothing or lodging; many more put into pin∣folds
upon the Sea-shore, and kept there half
their time dry and half wet, being every tide


overflown by the Sea; but these were permit∣ted
to eat and drink, to keep them longer alive
in this misery, which lasted ordinarily ten or
twelve daies. These bloody Executioners put
out the Parents eyes, and placing their little
Children by them, pinched and plagued them
whole daies long, enforcing them with tears
of blood to call and cry to their helpless Fa∣thers
and Mothers for an end of their suffer∣ings,
which had no period but with their lives,
whilest their woful Parents, unable to assist
either their Children or themselves, did often
die in their presence, whom they could not
see for grief or sorrow. All these miseries,
too long and too many to relate, were borne
by the poor Christians with constancy to a
miracle; except some few, who not able to
resist the bitterness of these torments aban∣doned
their Faith, for some relaxation from
pain. Once a year they precisely renewed
their Inquisition, and then every individual
person must sign in their Church-books, with
his blood, that he renounces Christianity;
and yet all would not do, for many hundreds
of Christians are found every year, and de∣stroyed
with variety of torments. At last
they found a more hellish and exquisite way
of torturing then before; they hung these suf∣ferers
by the heels, their heads in pits, which


to give the blood some vent, they slasht light∣ly
cross-waies, (but they do that now no
more) and in this posture they live several
daies, ten or twelve, and speak sensibly to the
very last: The greatness of this torment sur∣passeth
all other, being beyond all humaine
strength to suffer and be undergone, but by
such who are extraordinarilie strengthened
from above. This extremitie hath indeed (by
reason of its continuance) forced many to re∣nounce
their religion; and some of them who
had hung two or three daies, assured me that
the pains they endured were wholly unsuffer∣able,
no fire nor no torture equalling their
languor and violence.


The Christians being now almost rooted
out, there is an order, that when one is found
and condemned to be hanged by the heels,
he shall be pardoned, in case he informeth
against and produces another, which is now
too much practised, for Apostacy helps no
more, and they cannot resist the torments of
hanging, but are thus forced to betray one
another: neither will this help these misera∣ble
creatures, for I have been assured that they
register the names of such who were permit∣ted
formerly to fall off, as also of such who
by their discovering of others saved their own
lives, with an intent, that when they suppose


that they have the entire number and cata∣logue
of all them who have and do yet profess
Christ, they may destroy them all in one day.
During these bloody and savage persecutions,
it happened that some Christian Children, be∣cause
of their beautie, were begged and saved;
but many of them of eight, ten, and twelve
years old, &c. refused this grace, protesting
with courage, to a wonder, that they would
not live, they did not fear death; but would
go where their Parents went, into that joy
where they should be no more tormented:
Some of these Children who had not this
force, but desired to live and survive these
pains, were violentlie hurried to their deaths
by their Parents, with these comforting
words; 
Come my Children, do not live with
these wicked wretches, I will bring you into a
land that is rich and beautiful, where we shall
continue for ever in joy and happiness.
 The
common sort of Christians were but simplie
bound when they were led to their executi∣ons;
but the Priests, whether Portugals,
Spaniards or Japaners, had the hair of their
heads and beards half shaven off, the shaven
part being coloured red; bits were also put in
their mouthes, to hinder them from speak∣ing;
and their heads being pulled backwards,
with halters put about their necks and tied be∣hinde


them, they were compelled to hold
their faces directly upwards; and thus sitting
upon a lean horse, they were carried to the
place designed for their martyrdom. I should
be larger in the prosecution of these sad rela∣tions,
but that I leave them to their particular
story hereafter annexed.






How this Nation lives in their
Houses and Families.


ALl the houses in this Country are built
of wood and timber, which is likewise
their fewel; hence their houses are much sub∣ject
to burning, one of the plagues very fre∣quent
in their Towns; for this cause each
house hath its pack-house of proof against
the fire, wherein they keep their best and
choise goods. The houses are all built four
foot high from the earth, made of planks
closely covered with thick mats very artifici∣ally
joyned, resembling each other and uni∣form;
they dwell most below, their upper
rooms being employed to keep their smaller
houshold stuffs; but their best Chambers,
where they receive and entertain their Friends,
are neat and sumptuous, according to their
several abilities. The Souldiers and Gentry


have their houses divided, one side for their
Wives, and the other for them, for their
Friends and their ordinary vocation. The
Marchants and Citizens Wives dwell promis∣cuously
with their Husbands, governing and
ordering their families as with us; but are
very modest, and never spoken to but with
respect, none presuming to use any freedom
in discourse with them, although otherwise
innocent and harmless, for both the man that
took, and the woman that permitted this fa∣miliarity
would be equally slighted, and bla∣med
and looked upon as culpable and scanda∣lous.
Their houshold-stuff consists ordina∣rily
in fine painted gilt dishes, instead of pi∣ctures;
the walls of their chambers are also
for the most part painted with variety of fi∣gures,
and laid with gilt paper so curiously,
as if it were but one large sheet; the boards
round about being beautified with lists of
black Wax, very artificially wrought; most
of their rooms are divided with shuts, pre∣pared
and painted as the walls are, which be∣ing
taken out, enlarges the rooms at pleasure.
In the upper end of this partition they have a
picture with a potfull of flowers, which they
have ready all the year long; and at the lower
end there is alwaies a gallery, with stairs to
descend into their gardens, which are alwaies


green, and so placed, that they in the hall
have the full prospect of it. They do not fur∣nish
and adorne their Houses with Chests,
Cupboards, Wax-works, and the like, these
are alwaies in their free-Chambers, or pack∣houses,
where none is suffered to enter, but
their familiar and most intimate Servants and
Friends. Their chief furniture which they
expose, are 
Tsia
 Cups and Pots, Pictures, Ma∣nuscripts,
and Sables, which each provides
himself of, rich and goodly, according to his
condition and might.






How they receive each other,
and of their Hospitality.


THe Japanners are very hospitable and
civil to such as visit them, they treat them
with Tobacco and with 
Tsia,
 and if the friend
be more then ordinary, with Wine: They
cause them first to sit down, and setting a
Lack bowl before them, will not suffer them
to depart before they have tasted of it; they
sing, they pipe, and play upon such stringed
instruments as they have, to rejoyce their
Guests, omitting no manner of carouses and
kindnesses to testisie their welcome, and the
value they put upon their conversation. They


never quarrel in their debauches, but he that
is first drunk retires and sleeps, until the fumes
of the wine be evaporated. There is no such
thing as Tavern or publick drinking House in
all the Countrie; they eat, drink and are merry,
but all in their own houses, not refusing lodg∣ing
and refreshment for the traveller and stran∣ger.






Of their Conjugal State.


THese People neither make love nor woo,
all their marriages being concluded by
their Parents, or for want of such near rela∣tions,
by the next of kin. One Man hath but
one Wife, though as many Concubines as he
can keep; and if that Wife do not please him,
he may put her away, provided he dismiss her
in a civil and honorable way. Any Man may
lie with a Whore, or common Woman, al∣though
he be married, with impunitie; but
the Wife may not so much as speak in private
with another Man, as is already said, without
hazarding her life. What is said of divorce,
relates only to the Citizen, Marchant, and
common Souldier; a Gentleman or Lord may
not put away his Wife, although she should
not please him, and that out of respect to her


quality and his own Person; he must main∣tain
her according to her condition and ne∣cessities;
but may freely divert himself with
his Concubines and Women, and when the
humor takes him with his own Wife again.
This liberty that the Men have, obliges the
Women to observe their Husbands, and en∣deavour
to endear them to them, by an hum∣ble
compliance and submission to their hu∣mors,
being sure else to lose them, and see
their Rivals preferred before them. Open
Whore-houses are publickly allowed of, as
well for the use and conveniency of Batche∣lors,
as to prevent the debauching of young
Maids and married Women.






Of the bringing up of their
Children.


CHildren are carefully & tenderly brought
up; their Parents strike them seldom or
never, and though they cry whole nights to∣gether,
endeavour to still them with patience;
judging that Infants have no understanding,
but that it grows with them as they grow in
years, and therefore to be encouraged with
indulgence and examples.


It is remarkable to see how orderly and how


modestly little Children of seven or eight years
old behave themselves; their discourse and
answers savouring of riper age, and far sur∣passing
any I have yet seen of their times in our
Country. None go to School under seven or
eight years of age, as being until then unca∣pable
of its rules, and more inclined to play
then to learn, unless it be waggishness and
wantonness. At School they begin by de∣grees,
by sweetness and not by force, the Ma∣sters
imprinting an ambition and desire in
each of them to out-go his fellow; they lead
them likewise by examples, telling them that
such and such learned so much in so little time,
whereby his Honour and Family was so high∣ly
advanced. The Children are so accustom∣ed
to this way, that they learn sooner and
more then by any correction or whipping;
for generous spirits, and an obstinate Nation,
such as this is, are not to be forced, but ra∣ther
won with gentleness and emulation.








What Succession ab in∣testato.


WHen the Parents are grown old, and
the Children come to be Men, the Fa∣ther
then quits his Government, Commerce,
Shop or Trade, placing his eldest Son in his
room, and giving him the greatest part of his
Estate; the younger Children are likewise
provided for by the indulgent Parents, al∣though
their portions return to the eldest in
case they die before them. Daughters have
no portions at all, nor nothing given them at
their marriage; sometimes it happens that rich
Parents send a good sum of money with their
Daughter, upon their marriage day, to their
Son in law; which present is returned by the
Bridegroom & his Parents with much thanks,
being unwilling that the Bride should have any
colourable excuse to raise her into an opinion
of having obliged her Husband: The poorer
sort do but seldom return these offers as need∣ing
them, and glad of any augmentation of
their Friends. They have a common saying,
that a Woman hath no constant dwelling,
living in her youth with her Friends, being
married with her Husband, and when she is
old with her Childe.








VVhether they be faithfull or
false in their dealings.


THis Nation is very trusty, and that out of
their ambition, the only mark they aim
at; hence it is that they seldom wrong each
other, esteeming their honours above their
lives and hopes: examples of this kinde are
frequent amongst them, I will only relate one.
During the civil Wars between 
Ongoschio
 and
his Puple, the King of 
Cocora
 (who followed
the Usurper) had left his Queen and Children,
as the fashion is, at the Emperours Court;

Fideri
 having notice of this revolt, sent for

Cocora
's Wife and Children to come into the
Castle, the better to secure them; which the
Lady refused, excusing her self, 
That she was
married, and under the obedience of her King,
as he was under his imperial Majesty; let him
command her Lord, and she would most readily,
upon receipt of his orders, submit to his High∣ness
pleasure.
 The Emperour, angry at this
denial, sent her word, if she would not come,
he would cause her to be brought by force.
The Queen, who thought no dishonour e∣qual
to that of quitting her house in her Hus∣bands
absence, and seeing she could not con∣serve


her self in it against the Emperours fury,
resolved to perish with it; she therefore com∣manded
some barrels of Gun-powder to be
brought into a Chamber, where she retired
with her Children, Nurse, and such of her
Women who were resolved to die with her;
and there writing her Will and her own Elegy,
she conveyed them by a trusty Gentleman in
her service to her Lord; and immediatly there∣upon,
putting fire to the Powder, prevented
that loss of honour which she feared, and the
Emperours design by that fatal blow. If it
happen that a person be in a strait and enga∣ged,
and comes to another for assistance, re∣commending
the protection of his life and
honour to his generosity, this Man will hazard
all, without respect of Wife and Children; for
the service of his Friend, and perish or deli∣ver
him out of his distress and misfortune;
they will die, nay suffer the worst of tortures,
rather then discover their complices, although
in evil, thinking the breach of covenants in∣expiable;
and the dishonour of not helping
their neighbour, and one that hath thrust him
into misery, worse then any death whatso∣ever.








What Traffick and with what
Nations.


THe Trade of this Country (which is but
small in respect of the vastness of it, and
it abounds with all sorts of Merchandise) is
carried on by Strangers, the principal where∣of
are the Chinesses, who from the first peo∣pling
of this Empire to this day, have been
constant frequenters of their yearly Marts.
The Spaniards and Portugals have been ac∣quainted
with this People above an hundred
years; the English but of late, who finding
but little profit and great expences, abandon∣ed
this Traffick again. The 
Siammers
 and

Camboiders
 used also to arrive with a ship or
two, though not now so often as formerly.
Lastly the Netherlander got footing there,
where they have seated themselves fast enough,
and traded these forty years. The principal
Commodities, as well those which Strangers
bring, as such which are of the growth of the
Country, are all brought to the great City of

Meaco,
 which is the Staple of the whole
Empire; it is here that the Merchants and
Factors, from every part of the Land, do as∣semble,
bringing with them such things as


their several Provinces do produce, which
they sell or change for others which they stand
in need of. These Merchandises are carried
sometimes two or three hundred miles to and
fro, over hills and dales, all upon horses,
whereof they have an incredible number. The
Traffick consists of all sorts of wares, as well
for the pride as use of man; Strangers bring
yearly four or five thousand Picols of Silk,
each Picol weighing one hundred twenty five
pounds weight, besides a great quantity of
wrought Silks; two hundred thousand Harts∣skins;
one hundred thousand Rochvellen∣skins;
a great abundance of Hemp, Cloth,
Cotton, and red Wool; Carpets to sit upon,
Pewter, Quick-silver, and all sorts of Drugs;
Nutmegs, Peper, Musk, Sugar, Porcelan,
Camphier, Borax, Eliphants-Teets, red Co∣ral,
and all sorts of small Wares, which the
Chineses bring thither.






What domestick Trading,
and Navigation.


HEre are many very rich Merchants who
drive great Trades, these go themselves,
or have Factours at 
Meaco,
 where they ex∣change
their Commodities for Silver, Gold,


or other Wares, each according to his fancy
and convenience. The 
Japanners
 of old had
great correspondencie with them of 
China,

whose Kings sent Ambassadors yearly to each
other, for entertaining their alliance, and the
negotiation of their Subjects; it happened
that the 
Japanners,
 who were numerous in

China,
 did mutiny, and in a tumult destroy
a whole City, plundering, ravishing, and
spoyling all; but the 
Chinesses,
 getting into a
body, fell upon the 
Japanners
 again, and put
all they could meet with to the sword. The
King of 
China
 hearing of these discords, was
no less amazed then in a wonder, that so few
could do so much mischief, and therefore re∣solved
to banish the 
Japanners
 for ever out of
his Kingdom; in memory whereof he caused
a great stone Pillar to be set up, with the story
of their exile in letters of Gold. He likewise
set out a Proclamation, that none of his Sub∣jects,
upon paine of death, should saile any
more to 
Japan;
 which order was then more
exactly observed then at present, and yet they
do not directly go thither; for the 
Chinesses.

under a colour of other voyages, do often slip
into 
Japan.
 The Emperour of 
Iapan
 doth not
at all obstruct their traffick, permitting them
to enter and leave his Countrey when they
please, Saying he will not reward evil for evil;


considering also that the reason of this pro∣hibition,
on the other side, came not through
any fault of the 
Chinesses,
 but by the disor∣ders
of his own People. Since the 
Iapanners

have been banished out of 
China,
 they used
to sail to 
Tayouan,
 where the 
Chinesses
 brought
them their Merchandises; but that being dis∣covered
by the Court of 
China,
 they were
prohibited this Traffick likewise. Many years
after the 
Iapanners
 obtained leave to return
to 
Tayouan,
 as also to go to 
Touckien, Cam∣bodia,

and 
Sian;
 which negotiation was again
disturbed, upon this consideration, that the
Emperour of 
Iapan
 would neither offend nor
be offended by any Strangers, which had al∣ready
happened by the extortions of the Go∣vernours
of 
Sian
 and 
Tayouan;
 and therefore
none of his Subjects should any more traffick
or deal with Strangers out of their own Coun∣try:
Another reason was, because he would
have no Arms transported out of his Empire,
(which could not be hindred by no way but
this) insomuch that two 
Chinesses,
 Father and
Son, were both crucified at 
Finando,
 for en∣deavouring
to convey some away in private;
and five 
Iapanners,
 who had sold them the said
Arms, without knowing their design, were
beheaded. But the chief cause of this inhabi∣tion
is, least the Natives of this Country, tra∣velling


into strange places, might be convert∣ed
to the Christian Religion, and upon their
returne infuse those forraigne principles into
their Country-Men, which they have endea∣voured
to suppress with so much blood and
violence.






The Profits amounting thence.


NEither the Emperour, nor his subordi∣nate
Kings or Lords, do gain any thing
at all by the Commerce of their Subjects, the
Merchants onely profit by it, although the
gaine be not extraordinary, by reason of the
greatness of the Country, the charge of tran∣sport,
and the multitudes of people which
must live by it.






Their correspondency with
Strangers.


THe 
Iapanners
 hold no correspondency at
all abroad, having never yet sent their
Ambassadours into any forraigne Countries,
except 
China,
 which they have also long dis∣continued.
The King of 
Spain,
 the Pope,
and the King of 
Siam,
 have sent several extra∣ordinary


Ambassadours to this Court, which
were indeed honourably received and feasted,
though never any returns made again by this
Prince.






The Commodities which Ja∣pan
yeildeth.


THere is nothing necessary for the use of
Man, but this Country doth abundantly
produce, as Silver, Gold, Brass, Iron,
Tin and Lead, in great quantity; also Cotton,
Hemp, Silk, Filoselle, Harts-skins, Wooden
Manufactures, Drugs, and whatever can be
required to feed and cloath its innumerable in∣habitants.






Their Mint, Measures, and
VVeights.


THe 
Iapanners
 have one Language, one
fashion in their Clothes, one Mint, and
one Weight; they have indeed besides
their Gold and Silver Coins, a sort of Copper
Monies, which they call 
Casies,
 and is of dif∣fering
value in many of the Kingdoms; but his
Majesty hath resolved to re-coin these 
Casies



into one fashion, to which end he hath order∣ed
all the old ones to be called in, and bought
them of their owners at their full worth and
price, where with his Officers have been bu∣sied
these four years. They have three sorts of
Gold coin; the first and greatest weigheth six
Royals, and is worth forty six Tayles, each
Tayle being valued at fifty seven Stivers, or
Pennies: the second sort is worth six Tayles
and one half; and the third (being the least)
one and one sixth of a Tayle. Their Silver
Money is of the Alloy of Dollers, cast into
long figures, of no certain weight, but by
guess; they put so many of these together as
weigh fifty Tayles, the which being neatly
lapped up in papers, are distributed as occa∣sion
serveth: They have yet a lesser Silver coin
like a Bean, weighing from one Dutch Shil∣ling
to ten; and lastly the Casiens, already
mentioned, of differing worth, from one
Doller to three, one fourth, the thousand.
Their Yard, the Measure of their Grain, and
their Weights, are equal and not differing
at all.








VVhat Beasts and Fowl they
have.


THis Countrey produceth Horses, Bulls,
(for they never geld their Cattle) Cows,
Deare, and Swine, both wilde and tame,
in great abundance: There are likewise plenty
of Bears, Dogs, Cats, and the like; there is
no end of their Fowl, especially Swans, Geese,
Ducks, Herns, Eagles, Hawks, Pheasants,
Pigeons, Snipes, Quails, Partridges, and all
manner of lesser Birds.






VVhat Medicinal VVaters.


THey have several Fountains and Springs
of hot Medicinal Waters, proper for the
curing of many Diseases, and succesfully
used for that purpose; some are Sulphurous,
some taste of Copper, others Iron, Tin, Al∣lom,
and the like Mettals and Minerals, par∣taking
of the qualities of those they pass by.
I have seen of these Springs, one whereof be∣ing
Tinish, burst out of a hollow in the side of
a Mountain, some ten foot in the round; this

ole was, by reason of its depth, very obscure


within, its Orifice, or Mouth, being strange∣ly
beset with sharp Stones, not much unlike
the short teeth of an Elephant, or those which
Painters appropriate to Divels. The Water
flows continually out of this Cavern in a great
quantity, and is not hot, but a man may sit
in without disturbance. I have seen another
at the foot of a Mountain near the Sea, which
rendered its Water but at times, ordinarily
twice in twenty four hours, but this flowing
did not continue above an hour; when the
winde blows East and stifly, it flows thrice,
and sometimes four times in a day and night:
This Water rises out of a stony Pit, being co∣vered
with huge massie Stones of very great
weight; when the time of flowing comes,
it bursts out of the earth in so great a quantity,
and with such a forceable winde, that those
great Stones are violently moved and shaken,
the streams gushing and spouting three or four
fathoms high, with so dreadful a noise that it
equals that of a Cannon, or the falls of the
greatest Rivers: This Water is so very hot,
that it is impossible to boyl ordinary Water
to its height; it singes where it falls, and left
to its self continues hot thrice longer then any
other. This Well is surrounded with a Wall
for fear of harm, little Conduits being made
to convey its Streams to the neighbouring


houses, where it is used by way of bath, for
the curing of all distempers and maladies.






How the Kings, Princes, and
Peers of the Kingdom, re∣ceive
Audience of his
Imperial Majesty,
and what train they
must have.


THe solemn and great feasts of this People
are manifold, the first and greatest is
New-Years-Day, then the second and third
Day of the third Moneth, the third and fifth
Day of the fifth Moneth, the fourth and se∣venth
Day of the seventh Moneth, and the
fifth and ninth Day of the ninth Moneth. Be∣sides
these, his Majesty gives publick Audi∣ence
twice every Moneth, at new and full
Moon, to all his Kings, Princes, Lords, and
Gentry, who according to their qualities and
orders, do homage and reverence to him. The
train and attendance of these Grandees are
appointed, the greatest of them may not ex∣ceed
an hundred followers; the lesser being


also stinted and proportioned according to
their revenues. Some of these Princes have
indeed four or five thousand, as well Men as
Women, in their services, but these they keep
in their Palaces, and may not enter the first
ring of the Castle, nor into the City with
them: Now such as are permitted to come into
these two places with an hundred Servants,
may not enter the second ring of the Castle
with more then twenty Attendants; neither
may they be seen there on horse-back, it being
the dwellings of the Princes of the blood, and
the Councellours: the great ones are carried
here in Pallaquins or Sedans, others of less
quality going on foot; which is no difficult
thing, the waies and streets being finely paved,
and the middle of them set with great flat free∣stones,
which are kept extraordinary neat and
clean: But no Man whosoever is suffered to
enter the third ring of the Castle, where the
Emperours Palace is, but on foot, and only
accompanied with two Servants, and a Boy to
carry his Shoes; they of the second rank are
allowed but one Servant and a Shoe-carrier;
and those of the last rank only a Shoe-carrier.
There never happens any the least disorder,
running, playing, bawling, or confusion a∣mong
the people at these shows, every one
continuing in a serious and silent posture, as


if they were in the Emperours presence. E∣very
one in this Procession marches in his or∣der
and rank, so that there is not the least stir
even amongst the Servants. The Souldiers
stand in the Galleries we formerly mentioned,
and certain sworn Commissioners go to and
fro, to observe both them and all others, so
that the least stir and noise is capital: This
strictness is not burthensome, but grown so
familiar by custom, that the least irregularity
or tumult is not heard of. The same order is
observed in all the Towns of the Countrey,
the streets being all uniform, each end of each
of them being shut with Barrocadoes in the
night, and kept with watches; so that no body
is suffered to go out without a Ticket from
the chief Magistrate, which is delivered to
the Magistrate of the street, for the conveni∣ency
of those who need them, to fetch a Mid∣wife,
Physitian, or some near Friend in case
of necessity, the Barrocadoes are opened to
such messengers as these, and none else; so that
they never have any tumults in their streets,
roberies, murthers, house-breakings, or any
such unwarrantable disorders.








Their Language, manner of
VVritings and Reckonings,
and how far they trans∣mit
their History to
posterity.


THe 
Chineses, Iapanners, Corees
 and 
Tor∣quains,

have their distinct Languages,
wholly strange to each other; neither have
their Characters any resemblance, and yet
they have another fashion of Letter common,
and understood by the Studious and Learned
of these four Nations; in this their Sciences
& Wisdom are written, although the Contents
and Characters be general, understood and
read by each in his own Tongue. They write
with Pencils, and ready enough; most of their
Errands are done by Letters, which, by rea∣son
of their quickness in dispatch, is no let to
them, and the surer way; A man that can con∣tract
much matter into few lines, and intelli∣gible,
which is that which they all practice,
is greatly esteemed amongst them; for such
they imploy to write their Letters, Petitions,


and the like to great persons; and truly it is
admirable to see how full of substance, and
with how few words these sort of writings
are penned. They have not the Italian manner
of keeping of Books, and yet fail not in their
calculations; they reckon with little pellets,
stuck upon little sticks upon a board, for the
same purpose, after the manner of the 
Chineses;

wherewith they will add, multiply, and di∣vide,
with more facility and certainty then
we with Counters.


They have many Books and Libraries,
though the common people are most illite∣rate:
The 
Deyro
 himself writeth the Annales
of his Country; and all other Books are writ∣ten
by himself or his Lords and Gentlemen,
(which are at least eight hundred strong) or by
their Wives and Women; for these Gallants,
as well Men as Women, being of kin, and
married into each other, do nothing but spend
their time in all worldly pleasures, and the
studies of humain knowledge. Men are e∣steemed
and honoured with Titles, in this
Court, according to the merit of their under∣standing,
not their births; and it happens some∣times,
that the greatest are by their weakness
and folly brought down and unconsidered.
These Grandees, proud with their birth and
breeding, consider no body but themselves,


neither converse with any save only their own
Comrades; for their dwellings and streets
joyn upon each other, being invironed and
shut up from the rest of the world. They
speak a higher style then the vulgar, wherein
all their learning is couched; and many of
them esteem themselves more noble then the
Emperour, being indeed dignified with high∣er
and more honorable Titles then their Sove∣raign.
Printing and Gun-powder was in use
in this Nation above one hundred and fifty
years before we in Europe had the knowledg
of them: these they learned from the 
Chineses,

who have had them long, as their Histories
and Chronicles (filled with wonders, too long
for this short relation to mention) do abun∣dantly
witness.








An Extract out of the
Governour of Indiaes
Letter to the Over∣seers
of the East-In∣dia-Company,
tou∣ching
the Traffick in
Japan.


THis year trade (as we mentioned in our
last of the twelfth of this instant) hath
been but little advantagious, by reason
of the disasters at Sea, which hath much weak∣ned
and put behinde hand the India Capital
or Stock, which will without question sud∣denly
change. God preserve the Company
from more misfortunes at Sea. We hope, if
your Honours will second us this following
year with fifteen Tonne of Gold and Mer∣chandise,
we shall be able to make a return of
thirty, being the Indian Commodities may
probably rise more then they are now fallen:

Iapan
 will in all appearance yeild us eleven or
twelve Tonne profit; 
Persia
 at least three


hundred thousand; and the other indulgent

Cantoors,
 above three Tonne. The Dutch
expences, which arose this year, will certain∣ly
fall, being the building and fortification of
the dwellings and pack-houses come to cease.
There is but little hope of advantage from the
Enemy; nor shall we be able to 
Cape
 much
this year about 
Spirito Sancto,
 by reason of the

Portugals
 sufficiency. We will endeavour to
better all things by an advantagious negotia∣tion,
hoping much from 
Iapan:
 It were not
strange if the 
Chineses
 were hindered to fre∣quent
that Kingdom, or diverted by us: They
profit fifty Tonne of Gold every year and
more by the 
Iapan
 trade; for they transport
more then for one hundred Tonne yearly;
God grant that we may enjoy this trade alone,
and that the Gold Mine in 
Formosa
 flourish,
that the ingaged may once enjoy the fruits of
their charges and pains by rich returns, with∣out
sending any monies out of the low Coun∣tries.
I send you herewith a Copy of 
Sirage∣mondenne,

Governour of the Island 
Kisma
 in

Naviga-sacki,
 where the Companies Ser∣vants
and Factors do reside and trade; his Let∣ter,
which I mentioned in my last, be pleased
to consider of the contents thereof, with such
as understand the affairs of 
Iapan.
 It seems if
we do not meddle with Christianity, but be∣have


our selves modestly, they will grant us
the more liberty, and greater freedom in tra∣ding:
we will order all things to the most ad∣vantage
of the Company; and endeavour for
as much as it shall be possible, that we may en∣joy
all, or at least the principal trading (which
God grant) of 
A Formosa,
 a Land enriched
with Gold, near 
China,
 and lately conquered
by the 
Castlians.






A short Relation of the
Profits and Advanta∣ges
which the Dutch
East-India-Company
in Iapan might acquire,
in case they could com∣pass
the China Trade
and Commerce: By
Leonard Camps.


MAny men are of opinion, and have by
experience found, that during the
time it pleased the mighty States General of


the united Provinces, and his princelie Ex∣cellencie,
to give their Subjects leave to saile
into the East-India, for the increase of Traf∣fick
and the common good, that to what
place, or by what Prince soever we come, we
were admitted and received for fear of harm,
or for hopes of profit; and yet I believe, as
my Predecessours did before me, that his Im∣perial
Majesty of 
Iapan
 suffered us not to har∣bour
and to trade freelie in his Countrie upon
these considerations, but only to shew the
goodness of his Nature, the greatness of his
Dominions, and his civilitie to Strangers, e∣speciallie
those Nations who came into his
Countrie as Friends. His Majesties goodness
to Foraigners appears abundantly in this, in
that he still suffers the 
Chineses
 to traffick in his
Land, favouring them in his impositions more
then his own Subjects; whereas they perse∣cute
the 
Iapaners
 in their own Territories as
Enemies, having set a price upon their heads,
which by mistake hath cost many a Portugal
his life: further his ambition doth not extend
beyond the bounds of his own Empire, and
contenting himself with those confines God
and Nature hath prescribed him; he wages no
war against his Neighbours, neither suffers
his Subjects to molest or disturb any out of
his obedience. No foraign Princes fall out by


his instigation; neither doth he give or de∣mand
help or assistance upon any account. His
power and might consists in the vastness of his
Kingdom, and multitudes of his Souldiers;
he hath arms at will, Castles that seem impreg∣nable,
Provisions in abundance, and Treasure
without end. The plenty of Gold, Silver,
Copper, Iron, Lead, and Pewter Mines is
great; and the abundance of Silk, Cotton,
Hemp, and thousands other commodities in∣credible.
Brifley, this Countrie wants no∣thing,
having no need of its neighbours at all;
whence his Majesty never sought to foraign
Princes, and yet received all that came or sent
to him with all imaginable civilitie and kinde∣ness.


The Spaniards and Portugals, not ignorant
of the commodious scituation, might and
riches of the Japanish Empire, were no less
earnest in the enlarging of their own state,
planting the Christian Religion, and advan∣cing
their traffick there, where other Princes
seemed to desire. 
Don Iohn,
 the first of that
name, and the tenth King of 
Portugal,
 was
very industrious in this 
Disquisition;
 his Coun∣trey
men having in fourscore years, wherein
they continued their commerce in 
Iapan,

brought it so far, that 
Manilha
 was raised from
nothing by this negotiation, and 
Malacca Goa



and several other places bettered and enriched
by it; witness their great Cargasoons, and
yearly returns more or less, as it happeneth,
amounting one with another to near a Million
and a half of Ducats; never gaining less then
fifty, and for the most part seventy five in the
hundred, as we found by experience in that
time that our East-India-Company shared in
this rich commerce. The 
Mavaus
 and 
Por∣tugals

fetched these vast profits yearly, which
they gained in four or five moneths, whereof
they spent some twenty daies in going and
coming upon the Sea, the 
Iapan
 principal be∣ing
but one fifth part. Let every one consider,
whether this noble Negotiation and sweet re∣turns,
are not capable to indear these Mer∣chants
to this rich Country: Besides this, their
Religion, which by the zeal and industry of
their Priests grew strangely there, so that they
had four hundred thousand souls at once upon
a list, which made them in hope to become
absolute Masters of the whole Kingdom; this
they purposed, which had been absolutely ef∣fected,
but that they wanted an head; and
were traversed in this great design by the Ne∣therland
Ministers. If they had brought 
Iapan

to their devotion and obedience, as God be
praised they have not, it is no hard matter to
conceive the advantages they would have got∣ten


by it, and what they might further pre∣sumed,
upon so mighty an acquisition. But
my design is not to insist upon this matter,
only to undeceive those men who blindly out
of prejudice or ignorance, not only slight the
Japanish trade, but have given out, that it is
neither useful nor profitable for the East-India-Company.
But to return where we digressed;
it is not imaginable that the 
Portugals
 and

Spaniards
 are such fools, as to search out pla∣ces
to seat themselves in, and to carry on a
trade, where there is no advantage to be got;
that they have gained infinitely, and should
still if they were not hindred by us, is visible:
It is evident that they of 
Mavau
 are at present
rich, that their City is strong, and their Houses
like so many Palaces, wherein they live like
earthly gods in pleasure and plenty, whereas
they were before but bare and needy. Neither
did the ill treatment they lately received in

Iapan,
 nor the persecutions of the Women
Catholicks there, nor the loss of 
Andrew Pla∣soes
Caraek,
 who was assaulted and sunk, by the
Emperours command and forces, before 
Nau∣gasack,

nor the danger they incur by our ships
at Sea, can deter or oblige them to quit this
Kingdom: when the danger to saile thither
with great Vessels was too great, they trulked
with little ones; which this proud Nation,


who aspire to an universal Monarchie, would
never have done, if it had not been for the cer∣taintie
and sweetness of the profit: What can
our People alledge to the contrarie? is it not
as we have formerlie said, that the door is not
open for us alone, but for all other Nations
who come as friends to negotiate in his Ma∣jesties
Dominions. During our abode in 
Ia∣pan,

we have been treated with very great
civilitie; although we have not profited so
much as the 
Portugals,
 yet we have gained
more honour then they; we have not lost at
all, and our winnings have been proportiona∣ble
to our Cargasoons; we have had several
commodities thence, and much useful pro∣visions;
we have repaired many of our old
Ships in their Havens, and furnished them
with all manner of necessaries: The Fleets
we send from hence every year to the 
Manil∣has

against our common Enemie, return with∣out
being questioned by any, and dispose of
their prizes at pleasure, paying nothing but
the ordinarie rites, which is onlie a small pre∣sent
to the Emperour; what Christian Prince
in Europe would treat us so well, and molest
us so little? Now that it hath pleased the Al∣mightie,
that we by the good conduct of our
General 
I. P. C.
 do not onlie bridle them of

Maccau,
 but likewise hinder them to saile to



Iapan,
 and so keeps them from that rich trade
they enjoyed so many years; it remains onlie
that we still keep them out, to which purpose
especial care must be had to use the 
Iapaners

well and civillie; to hinder their detriment,
and not to dispise or misuse them in any kinde,
but to suffer every one to pass and re-pass
where their business calleth them, aiding and
assisting them with all possible endeavour and
friendship. We must not be less careful then
the 
Portugals
 have been, to furnish this King∣dom
yearlie with all manner of commodities,
bringing rather more then lesser; for if it take
according to the Generals design, which God
grant, they of 
Iapan
 will be deprived of the

Maccan
 commerce, as also of their trafficking
into divers others places, 
Kouthinchina, Kam∣boia,
Siam
 and 
Manilha,
 from which places
they received betwixt two and three thousand
picols of Silk every year, besides several other
necessary commodities, which they will be
obliged to take from us, as being nearer and
at their own homes. We must above all things
cherish his Majesties inclination to us wards,
and have a special care to remove all causes of
discontent that may arise; for if this mighty
Prince conceive the least distaste against us,
and refuse us his friendship and correspon∣dence,
it will be the onlie obstacle to hinder


us to compass our design; in this case we have
more reason to fear the 
Japanners,
 then either
the 
Spaniards
 or 
Chineses,
 as being no less po∣tent
and couragious then they, and powerful
enough to drive us out of the 
Piscadores,
 or
where we should endeavour to settle; but if
it must be so, we should be able to help our
selves without 
Japan,
 but not in so conve∣nient
a place, as we have mentioned already,
which we shall finde true in case we fall out
with them, which God forbid. Our Gover∣nour
hath shewn us a way, and recommended
it to us, which if followed, we may easilie
continue in his Majesties favour, and once
enjoy the long desired sweet profits which our
enemies have had so many years undisturbed;
and I doubt not, but by one way or other we
shall be able to get the unvaluable 
China
 trade
into our hands.


The 
China
 trade being then in our dispose,
all we have to do, is to send yearly into 
Japan

such Cargasoons as we shall hereafter menti∣on;
in the doing whereof, we shall not onlie
please his Majestie, and enjoy the sweet sa∣vouring
profits which our enemies will be de∣prived
of, but shall be able to satisfie our Ma∣sters
out of the gain, without any expence of
theirs, it being more then probable, that their
yearlie return will amount to an hundered


Tonne of Gold, which is ten Millions ster∣ling,
or more every year. 
Japan
 will be more
useful for us, and more profitable then it hath
been to the 
Portugals,
 if your affairs succeed
according to our Governour Generals mean∣ing;
for besides the Silk which the 
Portugals

brought from 
Maccan,
 the 
Iapanners
 fetched
themselves betwixt two and three thousand
Picols yearly, as we have already observed
from 
Courchinchina, Courchin Manilha,
 and
other places more, whereof they are hindred
and receive none, but what we bring them,
and at such rates as we shall please to put upon
them.


The Cargasoon which I should require,
and which would be vented there infalliblie
with profit, out of which our Masters might
have so much 
China
 ware as they demanded,
without the expence of a penny, is as fol∣loweth.




3000 Picols of white raw Silk, at 180 Roy∣als
of eight the Picol, amounts to R. 540000.


260 Ditto fine sodden Silk, at 200 Royals
the Picol R. 52000


500 Ditto raw Silk, in short and long
strings, at 180 Royals the Picol R. 60000.

This aforesaid 
China
 Cargasoon being sent
yearlie to 
Japan,
 I engage my self to my Ma∣sters,
so long as God gives me health, to serve
them for nothing, unless I return them in four
or five moneths time, in good Silver, One
million eight hundred and fifty thousand Roy∣als
of eight; if that be not enough, let them
send more and the gain will be greater. We
have taxed the goods at twenty 
per cent
 higher
then they will possibly be bought for, and that
purposelie, as knowing well that these goods
will first cost us more then the 
Portugals
 had
them for at 
Maccan,
 by reason of the fort
and Cargasoon that we must necessarilie hold
for the 
China
 trading. I know it will fall heavy
for our Masters, considering their other ex∣pences,
to furnish us with so much as is here
required; if it cannot be done at once, let
them furnish us with the half; the business can
be so ordered here, that one third part of the

Japans,
 and another third part of the 
Por∣tugals

principal be imployed, so that the Ma∣sters
need furnish but the rest, which they
may gaine back (and all charges paid) in six
moneths. The Overseers of the Company


do intimate by their Letters, their earnest de∣sires
to have great Cargasoons sent yearlie
home, for the easing of those vast expences
they are at; by reason whereof it happens, to
the great grief of our Governour General and
Councel of 
India,
 that many places fail often∣times
to furnish the desired 
quota;
 the which
hath obliged me to deliver this by writing to
their Honours, if they be pleased to hearken
to it, and furnish our demands yearlie, with∣out
delaying; if it cannot be found out of the

China
 commodities alone, it must be supplied
with Europian wares, as also with some Nut∣megs,
Peper, Eliphants-teeth, and the like,
that we may shew that our givings out to
our Masters shall not onlie reap the aforesaid
profits, but their Servant shall gain praise and
thanks, to the honour of the Netherland Na∣tion.
Sixty four Tonnes of Gold and a half
may be yearlie gained by these 
China
 Silke
Wares, besides other Commodities.








A description of the pompous
and magnificent reception of
the DEYRO in the City
of Meaco, when he came to
visit his Imperial Majesty
of Japan, on Octob. 25.
1626. Written by Coen∣raed
Krammer, deputed
from the East-India-Com∣pany
to that Court, and then
present.


IN the year 1626. having had audience on the
twentieth of 
October,
 I took my leave of
both the old and young Emperour, four daies
before the feast; which seemed strange to
them that knew it, being their Majesties were
so intent in their preparations for the 
Deyro
's
reception; but these men did not know how
desirous the Emperour was to dispatch the
Hollanders before the feast: however the 
Si∣ammer



and 
Portugal
 Ambassadours had not as
yet been publicklie received, and all by reason
of the present business, which took up the
whole Court, in so much that they were de∣ferred
till that was past; we being therefore
dispatched, had the more leasure and desire
to see this solemn entertainment, and the ra∣ther,
being invited to a stay by the Lord of

Firando
 and 
Cackusymondonne.
 On the twenty
fourth we went towards the Emperours Pa∣lace,
attended upon by all our Servants; and
having hired a place from which we might see
the whole procession, we were forced to stay
there that whole night, by reason of the great
crouds of people that passed that way; on the
morrow following, being the twenty fifth,
as soon as the day appeared, we saw an innu∣merable
company of people, who filled the
way up betwixt the Emperours Palace and
the 
Deyro
's Court. The streets were made
very even, and strewed with white sand, and
railed in on both sides, and guarded all along
by Souldiers of both their Majesties and of
the 
Deyro
's, all clothed in long white vest∣ments,
with head-pieces of black wax, and
armed each with two Sables and a Pike, for
defence of the passage through which the
Coaches and Horses were to march; all run∣ning
waters and ditches were covered with


boards and planks; and scaffols were raised
on both sides the way for the spectators.


The first that passed were Servants that be∣longed
to the 
Deyro
 and Emperour, with
many 
Palanquimos
 or Porters, who carried
the 
Deyro
's baggage, packt up in great square
Wax Chests (the covers whereof were paint∣ed
with the 
Deyro
's Arms in Gold) to the Em∣perours
Court: These were accompanied with
a great train of Attendants, who were again
followed by six and forty 
Palanquin
 Stooles or
Sedans, wherein the Women belonging to the

Deyro
's Wives were carried; these Sedans were
all of them curiously wrought of bright white
wood, six foot high, laid with plates of Cop∣per,
and finely painted, each of these being
carried by four lusty follows; after them went
one and twenty Sedans or 
Norimons,
 (for so
they call them here) covered with black Wax
and gilded, and behinde them some twenty
seven more whose doors and windows were
all gilded; some of the 
Deyro
's chiefe Lords
were carried in these, each of them having a

Quirosol
 wholly gilded, and covered with a
very rich covering, carried before them; these
Lords were attended by one hundred and eight
Pages in white liveries; behinde them marched
twenty four Gentlemen on horse back, clo∣thed
and armed in their Habillements of war;


their Head-pieces were of Wax, with little
black feathers behinde; they were clothed in
Coats with great wide sleeves; their Breeches
were long and small, made of even Sattin of
all colours, embroydered with Gold and Sil∣ver
very richly; they had little black Boots,
gilded with stripes of Gold; their Arms were
gilded; Sables with Bows and Arrows were
girt to them, with great rich embroydered
Scarfes, whose ends hung over on each side
of the Horse; their Horses were goodly and
beautiful, with little heads, little eares, and
short bodies; their Saddles were all waxed or
gilded, the seats being of embroydered works
or Tigers skins; the maines of these Horses
were twisted, or platted, with Silver and Gold,
the breasts and buttocks were adorned with
nets of Silk, whose strings hung low; they
had gilded horns on their foreheads, and were
shod with interwoven Silke in stead of Iron;
every Horse was lead by two Foot-men, two
great 
Quirosols
 made of fine linnen, and co∣verd
above with red cloth, with fringe round
about it, being born before, and serving to
cover the Horse, which vvas further attended
vvith eight Pages, or Servants, all in vvhite
liveries, and armed as the manner is, vvith tvvo
Sables or Svvords: And thus these Horse-men
rode by paces, from the 
Deyro
's to the Em∣perours


Palace in very good order. These
were followed by three rich Coaches, in
which were the 
Deyro
's three principal Wives;
each of these Coaches were four fathoms
high, two fathoms long, and one broad, be∣ing
beautified with Wax figures, and enameled
with Gold; there were three windows on
each side, and two before, being hung with
rich curtains; the entrie was behinde the
Coach, made like the gate of a Palace, with
chambers on both sides; all under the win∣dows
seemed black Wax; the rands of the
wheels were gilded, and the spoakes finely
turned and in-laid with Gold; when they
moved, they seemed to turn against a Look∣ing
glass, by reason of the clearness of the
glittering Wax, which was goodly to behold;
These wheels were covered with pent-houses
very artificially and richly wrought, every
corner of them being platted with fine Gold;
the top of all, or cover, was black Wax, where∣upon
the 
Deyro
's arms were curiously done in
Gold; every one of these great Coaches, or
rather Towers, were drawn with two great
strong Bulls, covered with nets of red twined
Silk, which were lead by four foot-men clo∣thed
in white; each of these Coaches valued at
seventy thousand Tayles, a Tayl being full
five English shillings. The train of Pages, all


clothed in white, that attended these Ladies,
was numerous, each of them having a gilded
foot-stool, and a pair of Wax slippers carried
behind them. Then followed twenty three

Norimons,
 or 
Palanquins,
 being made of white
Wood, and plaited with Copper, wherein
were the Servants of these three Ladies, each
waited upon with a great 
Quirosol,
 two Pages,
and four Porters to carry them. Behinde these
followed sixty eight of the 
Deyro
's Gentle∣men
on horse-back, clothed and armed as the
former; they marched by two and two, be∣ing
accompanied by a great train of Servants,
Slaves, Pages, Foot-men and Pike-men.


The aforesaid Cavalry being passed, there
followed



Two gilded Sables, the extremities of them
being plaited with Gold.


One great Vier-werck, rich and curious.


One Peyl Compas, exceding great and costly.


Two great gold Candlesticks.


Two great Eben Pillars.


Three small square Tables, or Desks, of black
Eben wood, the corners being plaited with
Gold.


Four great Tables of the same.


Two great faire Plates, or Dishes, wrought
in Gold.


One pair of wax Slippers.





Two beautiful Coaches, equal in form and
fineness with the former, followed these ra∣rities:
The old Emperour, 
Sadosienminano
Tonofindelanda,
 sate in the first; and in the
other the young Emperour, called 
Oeudesien∣minano
Tonoyuemytsamma.
 Fourscore pairs,
or couples, of Gentlemen marched on foot
before these Coaches; they were armed each
of them with two Sables and a Pike, being
all proper stout men, and serve for the Em∣perours
guards; four rich 
Quirosols
 were car∣ried
before their Majesties, and four men with
Pikes cleared the passage; two beautiful Hor∣ses,
richly trapped, were lead before the
Coaches, on whose sides eight Men, armed
with Bows and Arrows and long Pikes, did
march in order to wait upon them. The Em∣perours
Brothers, and all the Princes and great
Lords of 
Iapan,
 followed on horse-back,
clothed and armed as the former, save that
some were richer then other, according to
their births and qualities; there were one
hundred sixty and four of these Grandees,
the chiefe whereof, and those who imme∣diately
followed the Emperours, were



Owarny Cammy Samma,
 the old Emperors
Brother.


Quyne Deymangon Samma,
 another of his
Brothers.



Massammenemoet Nocammy Samma, 
yet
another Brother.


Matsendeyro Thuykesnocammi Samma,

Lord of
 Canga.


Matsendeyro Montsnocammy Samma, 
Lord
of
 Satsuma.


Matsendeyro Iondonne.


Matsendeyro Symoutsquedonne.


Matsendeyro Quonnenochwuchoo.


Turogano Deynangono Cammy Samma, 
the
young Emperours eldest Prince.


Myttotchonango Samma, 
the old Empe∣rours
Brother.




These ten Lords rode immediately behinde
the Emperours Coach, each by himself, at∣tended
with a numerous train of Gentlemen,
Pages, Pikemen, &c. according to their state
and quality: The rest of the Lords followed
by couples, two and two, the best of them
taking the left hand, which in this Couutrey
is the upper and best place; 
Ouwaydonne,
 the
old Emperours chief Councellor, and 
VVou∣tadonne,

the young Emperours chiefe Coun∣cellor,
led the van of the remaining one hun∣dred
and fifty four Lords, all of them march∣ing
in good order, great state and magnificency
and rarely mounted upon brave Horses, which
pransed and curvetted all the way. Four hun∣dred
armed Souldiers, all in white Liveries,


followed after these, two by two; and after
them six new fair Coaches, though not above
half so great as the other, and only drawn by
one Ox, but proportionably beautiful; the

Deyro
's Concubines sate in these, who were
again followed by thirty four pair of Gentle∣men
on horse-back, attended with many Ser∣vants
and Slaves. There was yet another Coach
wherein the 
Deyro
's Secretary rode, accom∣panied
with thirty seven Gentlemen on horse-back;
then followed the 
Norimons,
 which
carried several of the 
Deyro
's Grandees, wher∣of
fifteen were of black Wood, inlaid with
white Ivory; thirteen of black Wood, adorn∣ed
with Wax and Gold; and eighteen wholly
done over with black Wax. Forty six great
gilded 
Quirosols,
 with their attendants, fol∣lowed
these 
Norimons;
 and behinde them fifty
four Gentlemen, being the 
Deyro
's Musitians,
with several Instruments, as Pipes, Tabours,
Cimbals, Bells, and some stringed ones which
are not known amongst us. The 
Deyro
 himself
followed these Musitians, siting in a great square
Edifice, surrounded with drawing doors and
windows on each corner; this lodge was about
nine foot high, its cover being round, and in
the middle a gilded Ball, whereon stood a Cock
with his wings spread, of pure Gold: This
structure was very beautiful, being adorned on


all sides with carved Images, its angles plaited
with pure Gold, and the roof of it intimating
the Heaven, with Sun, Moon and Stars. There
were fifty Persons, all Gentlemen belonging
to the Emperours, clothed with long white
Robes, and Wax Head-pieces, that carried
this ambulatory Pallace: Forty Gentlemen an∣tickly
dressed, although armed with Europian
Head-pieces, and Pikes gilded at the ends,
went before the 
Deyro,
 and these were of his
Life-guard. One of his principal Lords did
immediately follow him, armed as the other,
bearing in his hand a Shield stuck full of Ar∣rows;
then came forty great 
Quirosols,
 all co∣vered
with fine white linnen, and belonging
to the aforesaid Guards: These were again fol∣lowed
by thirteen great Wax Chests, carried
by the Palanquyn Porters: And lastly, the
whole procession was closed with four hun∣dred
persons all in white vestments, marching
six in a ranke in very good order. The 
Deyro

and his Traine were no sooner past, but the
evening came on, and an innumerable com∣pany
of people of all sorts: the Stages and
Houses which had been filled with Spectators,
had disgorged their burthens in the Streets; so
that the multitude was so immensly great, that
very many disorders happened, as cutting of
purses, stealing, murthering and robbing each


other; very many were stifled in the crouds,
and such as but once fell, were sure never to
rise, being troden to death: The noise all night
was so great, as if the City had been in an up∣roar;
and the insolencies grew to that heighth,
that many persons of quality, who could not
get out of the throng, or were retiring to their
houses, were set upon, and very many of them
spoiled and murthered: among others, the
Lord of 
Firandos
 Secretary saw his Servant
robbed, and a rich Cabinet of his taken from
him, before his own face, whilest he himselfe
had much ado to defend himself from the vio∣lence
of these assaulters. We were forced, with
our Servants, to quit our stage, and put our
selves into the crowd, because of the night,
and the danger to continue where we were,
which we durst not do without running the
hazzard of being murthered; the preass was so
great, that we were borne up by the people
most of our way, being but seldom able to put
a foot upon the ground; yet at length, by Gods
great blessing, we got all (without any con∣siderable
loss) safely to our lodgings.


The 
Deyro
 and his Wives were lodged three
daies and three nights in the Emperors Palace,
being served by their Majesties and their Bro∣thers,
and the greatest Princes of their Court,
every meale consisting of one hundred and


forty services. This feasting being done, the
young Emperour gave the 
Deyro
 these fol∣lowing
presents:



Three thousand Boates of Silver, each of
four Tayls and three Marses.


Two rich Sables.


Two hundred 
Iapan
 Gowns.


Three hundred pieces of wrought Sattin.


Twenty picols of raw Silk.


One great piece of Calombacq.


Five great Silver pots full of Musk.


And ten beautiful Horses with their ac∣coutrements.






The old Emperour gave him


Two hundred pieces of Gold, each worth
fifty four Silver ones.


One hundred 
Indian
 gowns richly wrought.


Two great Silver pots full of Musk.


Five Catti Calombacq.


Two hundred pieces of red Silk.


Five Silver pots full of Amber Greece.


And five brave Horses with their accou∣trements.






His Secretary had given him


Three hundred Boats of Silver, equal with
the other in worth.


And twenty 
Indian
 Gowns.












A Description of the
Government, Might,
Religion, Customes,
Traffick, and other re∣markable
Affairs in the
Kingdom of SIAM:
Written in the Yeare
1636. by Joost Schouten,
Directour of the East-India-Company
in
that Countrey.


SIAM
 is a famous and potent King∣dom,
scituate upon the continent of

Asia
 eighteen degrees Northern Lati∣tude,
where it bordereth upon the
Countries of 
Pegu
 and 
Ava
 twelve de∣grees;
it extendeth it selfe Westward to the

Bengasche
 sea of 
Martavan
 to seven degrees,
where it borders upon the Kingdoms of 
Pay


tany
 and 
Queda;
 Southward from the 
Ben∣gasche

to the 
Patanys
 Ocean, this Coast turns
Northward to thirteen degrees, making with
its bowing the Gulf of 
Siam;
 thence the Coast
runs again Southward to twelve degrees, and
leaving the Sea terminates Eastward upon the
Desart of 
Cambodia,
 and the Kingdoms of 
Ian∣gonia,
Tangou,
 and 
Langjang
 to eighteen de∣grees,
even to 
Ava
 and 
Pegu;
 so that the form
of this Land is like an halfe Moon, and con∣taineth
in its circuit four hundred and fifty
Dutch miles, one Dutch mile makes six En∣glish.
This Country (which is in many places
mountainous, woody and moorish, especially
towards the Sea, although for the most part
even and clay, and is likewise full of all sorts
of Beasts and Fowls, and Rivers replenished
with abundance of Fish) hath where it bor∣dereth
upon the 
Benga
 and 
Siams
 Seas many
Islands, Bays, Havens and Rivers most com∣modious
for the receipt of great and small Ves∣sels;
I shall not particularize all, only mention
the chief River, as the most frequented Haven
of the whole Kingdom: This River (called
by the name of 
Menam,
 or the Mother of Wa∣ters)
is great, wide, and very long, its course
being not known unto them. It passeth from
the North Southward very swiftly through the
Land of 
Ava
 and 
Pegu,
 and several Provinces


of 
Siam,
 until that it discharge it self by three
mouthes into the Sea of 
Siam;
 it partaketh of
the nature of those famous Rivers 
Ganges
 and

Nilus,
 flowing once a year so high that it co∣vereth
most part of the Countrey, making it
incredibly fruitful, and destroying by this in∣nundation
(which continueth four or five
moneths) all obnoxious vermin and creatures.
The greatest mouth of this River, is that which
lies most Eastward thirteen degrees and a half
Northern latitude; and in the middle of the in∣let,
there is a great flat, or sand, a mile long, that
crosses the entry of the River five or six foot
deep at low water, but at heighth is fifteen or
sixteen, and in the Winter moneths, when the
the floods are great, there is ordinarily seven∣teen
or eighteen foot and more; great Ships
that go deep, are forced to anker at four, five,
or six fathoms water without this banck, the
ground being clay and good; but those that
pass this flat at high water, enter the River
without any more danger of runing on ground
till they come to the Town of 
Banckock,
 six
Dutch miles upwards; then the River grows
narrower and more shallow, Ships drawing
eleven or twelve foot water, being scarceable
to mount to the City of 
India,
 where they are
sometimes forced to stay till the moneths of

September, October
 and 
November,
 for water


to return. The Country is generally well peo∣pled,
especially the lower part of it, being full
of Villages and Towns; the principal whereof
are 
Iudica, Picelouck, Sourckelouk, Capheng,
Soutcethay, Kephinpet, Conseywan, Pytsyay Pit∣sidi,
Lydure, Tenou, Mormelon, Martenayo,
Lygor, Bordelong, Tannassary, Banckock, Pypry,
Rapry, Mergy,
 and several other, all which are
governments and heads of Provinces; besides
these there are many Cities and Burroughs full
of people, which I omit as superfluous. The
City of 
Iudica,
 the Metropolis of the King∣dom,
and seat of the King and his chiefest No∣bles,
is scituate upon the River 
Menam,
 in a
little round Island, encompassed with a thick
stone wall, about six English miles round; the
Suburbs are on the other side of the River,
closely builded, and full of Temples and Cloy∣sters,
lying in a flat and fruitful Country. The
Streets of the walled Town are many of them
large, straight and regular, with channels run∣ning
through them, although for the most part
of small narrow Lanes, Ditches, and Creekes
most confusedly placed; the Citizens have an
incredible number of small Boats or Prawes,
which come to their very doors, especially at
floods and high water. The building of the
Houses is according to the 
Indian
 fashion,
slight, and covered with Tiles; but the City


is beautified with more then three hundred
faire Temples and Cloysters, all curiously
builded, and adorned with many gilded Tow∣ers,
Pyramids, and Pictures without number.
The Kings Palace is seated upon the River, re∣sembling
a little Town apart, great and magni∣ficent,
many of its Buildings and Towers be∣ing
entirely gilded. This royal and admirable
City is perfectly well seated, and populous to
a wonder, being frequented by all Nations;
and is likewise impregnable, as not to be be∣sieged
but six moneths in a year, by reason of
the innundations of the River, which covers
the Countrey round with its overflowings.
The Soveraignity and Government of 
Siam
 is
in the King, a Prince of a Noble and ancient
family, who hath been in possession of this
Kingdom, and the neighbouring Provinces,
many hundred of years; this Prince is abso∣lute
in his Dominions, disposing of War and
Peace, Alliances, Justice, Pardons and Remis∣sions,
&c. at his pleasure; He maketh Laws
without any advise or consent of his Council,
or Lords, his will being the rule he walks by,
unlesse his goodnesse descend sometimes to
counsel with his 
Mandoryns,
 them of his
Council; these sometimes deliberate upon his
Majesties propositions, and present their re∣sult
to him by way of humble supplication,


which he confirms, changes or rejects, as he
thinks good. He disposes Soveraignity of all
the Dignities and great Offices of his King∣dom,
without respect of persons, noble or
otherwise, (except some of the Antientest and
greatest Families) to such as have or may serve
him well, whom he againe deprives of their
honours for small faults; so that they are all his
Slaves and Vassals, which the Great ones e∣steem
an honour, and put in their titles. The
King thus soveraignly disposing of all things,
doth notwithstanding nothing without some
appearance of reason, and conformity to the
Laws of the Kingdom, which however anti∣ent,
he by his usurped prerogative and power,
doth interpret and bow to his Arbitrary will
and pleasure. His Majesties Court and Train
is exceeding great and glorious; He seldom
shews himselfe to the People, and very spa∣ringly
to his Grandees and Officers of the
Kingdom, which happens at certain appointed
times and daies; when he gives them Audi∣ence
he is richly clothed and crowned, sitting
upon a golden Throne, at whose feet his Gen∣tlemen
and Attendants reverently kneel, ac∣companied
with three hundred armed Soul∣diers
of his Lifeguard: All, as well Strangers
as Subjects, who have audience of his Majesty,
whilest they are in his presence, must conti∣nually


kneele, with folded hands and heads
hanging down; when they speak to him, it
must be in this humble posture, loading him
with titles and praises; his Answers are estee∣med
Oracles, and his commands unchange∣able;
so that he lives happy in all imaginable
worldly pleasures, having many magnificent
Houses up and down the Kingdom, as also
other places, Tents and Pavilions: He eateth
highly, but his drink is simple water, or 
Coco,

all strong drinks being prohibited by the Cler∣gy
and the Laws, and esteemed scandalous.
His Majesty goeth ordinarily by water with
eight or ten very costly and fine Barges, each
with eighty or a hundred rowers; he sits un∣der
a gilded Pavilion upon a Throne, accom∣panied
with his Courtiers and other Barges,
to the number of three or four hundred, with
his Train and Guards waiting upon him; most
of the great Ones follow the Court at such
times, each in his rich gilded Barge or Praw;
so that the whole train of them is twelve or
fourteen hundred, and sometimes more. When
he goes by land, he is mounted upon a gilded
seat, and carried upon mens shoulders, the
train being ordinarily the same, all marching
in order and great silence; no body is seen in
his way or sight, but upon their knees, with
folded hands, and bowed heads and bodies;


this reverence better becoming a celestial Die∣ty,
then an earthly Majesty.


Once every year, about the moneth of 
Octo∣ber,

the King of 
Siam
 shews himself by water
and land in state to his people, going to the
principal Temple of the Gods, to offer there
for the welfare of his Person and Kingdom,
the manner follows: When he goes by land,
the procession is led by two hundred Ele∣phants,
each attended vvith three armed men;
these are follovved by many Musitians vvith
Gomnies, Pipes and Drums, and a thousand
men richly armed, and provided vvith Banners:
Then march the great Lords of the King∣dom
on horse-back, many of them vvearing
Crovvns of Gold upon their heads; and every
one vvaited upon by sixty, eighty, or an hun∣dred
men on foot: Tvvo hundred 
Iapan
 Soul∣diers
follovv these vvith bright Arms and rich
Colours, and much noise of Instruments; then
comes the Lifeguard vvith the King's Horses
and Elephants, richly adorned vvith pretious
Stones and Gold furniture; vvhich is follovved
by many Servants loaden vvith fruits and pre∣sents
for the Sacrifice, accompanied vvith a
svvet consort of Musick: These are again fol∣lovved
by many of the great Ones on foot,
vvith folded hands; as also some Crovvned
Grandees, vvhereof one carrieth the gilded


Standard, and the other the Svvord of Justice;
his Majesty follovvs next in person in his royal
Robes, sitting upon an Elephant, or else a
gilded Throne, carried upon mens shoulders,
and vvaited upon by many Lords and Cour∣tiers;
the Prince, or Heir of the Kingdom,
follovveth him; and then in order the Kings
Wives and Concubins, seated upon Elephants
in little enclosed Cabinets: lastly the ordinary
Courtiers follovv; the vvhole provision con∣sisting
of fifteen or sixteen thousand persons,
having its rear brought up by six hundred arm∣ed
men. But if the King go by vvater, then
tvvo hundred Lords, each in his Barge, seated
in a gilded Cabinet, vvith eighty or ninety
Rovvers, lead the van; these are follovved by
ten extraordinary rich figured Pravvs, or Bar∣ges,
the vvhich, as also the Oars, are all gilded,
each having ninety or an hundred Watermen:
The King is in the richest of them, sitting like
an Idol upon a golden Throne, vvith his Lords
in their humblest posture at his feet: the royal
Banner is borne by one of these Grandees, at
the head of the Barge, in state. The King's
Brother follovveth next vvith his Train; and
after him his Majesties Wives and Concubins,
in gilded Cabinets and Tents, each in their
Barges apart: lastly the Gentry, Courtiers,
Guards, and other Attendants follovv, the


vvhole amounting to five or six and tvventy
thousand persons. The River is bordered on
both sides vvith Boats, and an infinite number
of People, vvho reverence and adore their
King in his passage, vvith bended heads and
folded hands.


The Dominion and Revenue of the Crovvn
is great, amounting yearly to many Millions,
arising out of in-land Commodities, as Rice,
Sappang, Tin, Lead, Salt-peter; as also the
profits of the Sand and Mountain Gold, which
are only sold by the Kings Factors to forraign
Merchants: He hath also his Customs for out∣landish
Wares; his Tributes and Presents from
Subject-Princes, and Governours of Cities
and Provinces, who know how much they
must contribute; as also the profits of his
Traffick with 
Chormandel
 and 
China:
 add to
these the inland trade, carried on by his Fa∣ctours
in the City 
Iudica,
 or elsewhere, and
his Majesty of 
Siam
 will be found to be one
of the richest Princes of 
India.
 There are se∣veral
Officers appointed for the receipt of
incomes, who must account every year, and
that exactly: Most of these monies are ex∣pended
in building and repairing of Temples,
in rewarding of merits, and defraying the
publick charges of the Kingdom; the residue
being brought into the Treasury, which is


esteemed rich and great. The Laws and Cu∣stomes
of 
Siam
 are strange (though orderly)
in the succession of their Princes; when the
King dies, it is not his Son, but his Brother
who is Heir to the Crown; but in case he have
no Brother, then indeed his Son steps in by
course, whose Brothers do succeed succes∣sively;
lastly all the Sons of the eldest Brother,
who hath reigned, follow by turns, the Daugh∣ters
being wholly excluded any pretence to the
Government. But this order is not alwaies
observed, the Scepter being sometimes usur∣ped
by him of the family who is most power∣ful,
and most gracious with the people, which
is the present Kings case; who having raised
himself before his turn, caused all his Compe∣titors,
and their Adherents, to be slain, to the
end he might peaceably enjoy what he had un∣justly
got, and leave the Crown to his Bro∣ther
or Children after him.


The ordinary Justice, both Criminal and
Civil, is administred through the Kingdom ac∣cording
to their ancient Customes and Laws,
by Officers purposely appointed: But in the
City of 
Judica
 they have (besides the ordinary
Courts of Judicature) a Colledge of twelve
Councellours, with one principal President,
which doth definitively decide all Appeals, and
other businesses, whether Criminal or Civil.


It is indeed permitted, though with extraor∣dinary
expence and cost, to appeal to the King
and his Council, who ordinarily confirm and
cause the former sentence to be put in execu∣tion.
In this and lesser Courts, all Civil disputes
are brought in by Lawyers; and the cause be∣ing
pleaded, and witnesses examined on both
sides before the Commissioners, the Secretary
makes an extract of the whole, which being
writ in a Book, it is signed by both Plantiff and
Defendant, or others deputed by them; that
done the Book is sealed up, and kept by the
Judge till next Sessions; at which time it is a∣gain
opened in the presence of both parties,
and their debates heard, noted, and sealed as
before: So that the Lawyers, by their several
exceptions, demurs and practices, do very of∣ten
delay and keepe up the parties for many
years; until at length, after much sollicitings
and expence, the cause is anew opened and
examined, and finally adjudged and ended by
a full Colledge. But in Criminal matters, as
injuries, robberies, murther, treason, or the
like, the guilty, or suspected person, is appre∣hended,
imprisoned, and examined; if he deny
the fault against witnesses, or great presumpti∣ons,
he is forced by torture to confession; all
which being noted in a Book, and presented
to the Judges, they immediatly proceed to


Sentence and Execution; except in Capitall
crimes, such being reserved for the Kings plea∣sure,
who either pardons, banishes, or causes
the condemned person to be put to death, ac∣cording
to the sentence. Offences are ordi∣narily
punished as they are more or less hey∣nous,
with cashiering, banishments into De∣sarts,
slavery, confiscations, mutilation of hand
or foot, burning in oyl, quartering, and other
severe executions. Where the case is doubt∣full,
no witnesses appearing, nor no strong pre∣sumptions
against the accused, so that the Judge
knows not how or what to do, he then per∣mits
both parties to try it out by common pur∣gation;
either by ducking under water, hold∣ing
their hands in boyling oyl, to go bare-foot
upon hot coales, or to eat a mess of charmed
rice; this conjured mess being made up into
balls, is given them by the Priest with much
ceremony; and he that can swallow it with∣out
casting it up again, and behaves himself in
this and the other trials with most courage, is
esteemed most innocent and acquitted, whilest
the other, whether accusor or accused, is most
severely punished, according to the nature of
the crime.


The Kings power and military force by wa∣ter
and land, consists most of his own Vassals
and Natives; he hath indeed some few Stran∣gers,


as Moors, Malayers, and some five hun∣dred

Iapanners,
 the most esteemed for their
courage and fidelity, although the Prince now
reigning drove them out of his Country, but
they are now crept in again; so that most of
his forces are 
Siammers,
 who must serve with∣out
pay, and be alwaies in a readiness, the
hundredth, fiftieth, twentieth, tenth, or fifth
man being levied, according to the Kings plea∣sure
and occasions. Besides these, the Gran∣dees
have ordinarily some hundreds of men in
their service, who wait upon them in the field;
so that his Majesty can raise an Army when he
thinks good, of two or three thousand men,
with two or three hundred Elephants, Victu∣als,
Ammunition, and other warlike Instru∣ments;
for all this his Armies seldom exceed
one hundred thousand men, and not ordina∣rily
forty or fifty thousand, as his affairs re∣quire,
either for offensive or defensive. His
foot are in reasonable good order, though
merely armed with Bows and Arrows, Shields,
Swords, Pikes, and a few Guns: the horse
are not better, though generally armed with
Swords, Shields, Bows, and Lances. Most of
their force consists in some hundreds of tram∣ed
Elephants, each of them furnished vvith
three armed men; and they have a good quan∣tity
of Cannons, but do not well know how


to use them. At sea his Majesty hath several
Gallies and Frigots vvell provided vvith great
Guns, though the Seamen and Mariners are
but pitiful. The Pravvs, vvherevvith the 
Siam∣mers

can stoutly scuffle, are vvithout number,
but ill ordered and armed, and yet sufficient to
deal vvith their neighbouring enemies as un∣skilful
as they are, though far short of our
Europian Vessels and Mariners either to fight
or sail. These Mariners, especially vvhen their
Princes have been brave, have conquered ma∣ny
of the neighbouring Kingdoms and Pro∣vinces;
but being all human things, they have
their vicissitudes, these victories did but fol∣lovv
the fortune of their favorites.


There hath of old been great vvars betvvixt
them of 
Pegu
 and 
Siam,
 vvith various success:
the King of 
Pegu
 pretending to the Monarchy
of the neighbouring Kingdoms, vvhich he
hath formerly had, and as yet possesseth in
part; so that the borders of these Kingdoms
are quite ruined and unpeopled, and these
Princes of late years content vvith inroads and
sudden invasions, vvith small flying Armies of
tvventy or thirty thousand men, vvhich they
have ordinarily for defence of the frontiers.
The 
Siammers
 have had likevvise vvars against
other Princes, as the Kings of 
Jangoma, Tan∣gou,
Langhs-ja
gh
,
 and lastly against the King


of 
Siam,
 and stoutly defended himself against
those great Armies which were sent to reduce
him; of late the Kingdom hath been in peace
until the usurpation of the last deceased King,
who having destroyed the true Heirs, and pos∣sessed
the Government contrary to order, was
likewise himself slain, together with his Bro∣thers,
and the Crown seized upon by another
of the blood, who after several civil and for∣raign
broils enjoyed it peaceably, and governs
at present with great reputation and honour,
continuing still his wars with them of 
Pegu,

and the Rebel 
Cambodian.


This Prince, as well as his Predecessors, is
kinde to Strangers, but respects and esteems
the 
Netherlanders
 more then the 
Portugals;

which the late King sufficiently testified, when
upon the taking of a Holland Yacht in the Ri∣ver,

Anno
 1624. the Spanish Gally of 
Don Fer∣dinando
de Silva
 was violently seized upon by
his command, and restitution and satisfaction
made to our Company; hereupon he was for∣ced
into a war with them of 
Manhila,
 and suf∣fered
much in his 
China
 voyages, which was
well recompensed by the seasonable assistance
of six Dutch men of war, which were lent him
to be employed against his Rebels of 
Patany.


The King hath more then three thousand
tame Elephants in several parts of his Kingdom,


each attended by two or three men, wherein
much of his greatness doth consist; for these
Beasts are very much esteemed in 
India,
 espe∣cially
when trained up to the wars, the rest
are employed to carry Ordinances, Tents,
and Provisions to the Camp. These creatures
being great, very strong, and strangely docible,
are taken in several parts of the Country, and
disciplined as followeth: A Troop of fifteen
or twenty tame she Elephants, which were
taken when they were young, are driven into
the Wilderness, with two or three fellows to
observe them; the wilde ones upon sight of
them, associate with them, one or two at once,
which are driven with the rest insensibly into
a great square building with high stone walls,
and encompassed on the outside with trees
which cover them; as soon as these Beasts are
decoyed in, a great turn pike is shut behinde
them, and gates to hinder their return; when
they are entred further into the square place,
the tame Elephants being brought up to it by
their teachers, upon notice from them, slip
away through other gates for the purpose; so
that the wilde ones being left alone, are out of
other little squares, whereof one is in the mid∣dle,
vexed and tormented with all manner of
inventions to make them angry and furious:
the above mentioned squares are made of great


thick posts, well nigh two fathoms high, but
so far distant from each other, that a man may
creep betwixt them; so that when the Ele∣phant
with his running, turning and winding,
seeks to revenge himself upon his tormenters,
they save themselves behinde these posts; at
length, when the beast is weary, and suffici∣ently
tormented, thee is a great door opened,
into which he runs to save himself, which is
immediatly shut upon him, and he restrained
to a narrower prison, and is there bound to
two or three tame Elephants, placed for the
purpose; this done, they are led into a covered
house, where cross planks being contrived un∣der
the wilde ones belly, they are hoyssed up
with pullies, and left as it were half hanging
for some time; so that with this invention,
and help of the tame ones, they are wholly
tamed in three or four moneths, and rendred
supple and useful. The Court is for the most
part present (Galleries being builded for the
Spectatours) at the taking and tormenting of
the Elephants, which is most pleasant to be∣hold.
These Beasts are sometimes taken in the
open fields, being environed with tame ones,
and caught in snares and jins; but this way is
dangerous although often practised; and both
shew how fabulously Writers have informed
the World in this particular.



A white Elephant (esteemed by the 
Indians

a wonder in Nature) hath been found in 
Siam,

and no other known Land; it is esteemed by
the inhabitants as the Prince of the Elephants,
and hath been so treated by the Kings of this
Country, who have had of them in the Palaces
many times, and caused them to be served in
state, often visited them, and honoured their
Vassals with more then ordinary respect. These
white Elephants have formerly occasioned
great wars betwixt the 
Siammers
 and their
Neighbours; and some sixty years since against
the King of 
Pegu,
 who proving victorious, did
not only take the white Elephant prisoner, but
obliged the King of 
Siam
 to become his Tri∣butary;
which yoke the following Princes did
not only cast off, but gloriously revenge their
Predecessours misfortunes. During my first
residence in 
Siam,
 the then King took two
young white Elephants, but both died shortly
after to his great grief. This Nation believes
somewhat more then humain natue of this
creature, alledging they do not only respect
him for his whiteness, but for his divine under∣standing;
which appears in his pride and glo∣rying
when he is treated in state, and of his
melancholy and sorrow when those honours
are denied him, or that the black Elephant re∣fuses
him his obeissance.



The 
Siammers,
 as also the Neighbouring
Nations, are all Idolaters and Heathens, so that
they have every where great and little Temples
and Cloysters for the service of their Gods;
and the dwellings of their Priests. These Edi∣fices
are builded of Wood and Stone very Ar∣tificial
and sumptuous, with guilded Towers
and Pyramids; each of the Temples and Cloy∣sters
being filled with an incredible number of
Idols, of divers materials and greatness, gilded
adorned and beautified very rich and admira∣ble;
some of the Idols are four, six, eight, and
ten fathoms long; amongst the rest there is one
of an unimaginable greatness, being one hun∣dred
and twenty foot high. In these Temples
and Cloysters there are many Priests and reli∣gious
Men disciplined, and very obedient to
their superiours, being all subject to the Arch

Flamin,
 or Prior of the great Temple of 
Iudica,

whose spiritual power is vastly great, though
subordinate to the Kings. All the Clergy
(whereof there are in 
Iudica
 alone at least thir∣ty
thousand) are clothed, without any remark∣ale
difference, in yellow linnen clothes, having
their heads all shorn. The learnedst amongst
these are professed Priests, out of which the
Regents of their Temples are chosen, (who
are held in great esteem and reverence by the
People) preaching, teaching, and offering up∣on


their Feasts and Holy daies. These are pro∣hibited
the natural use of Women, upon pain
of being burned; but they may alwaies, and
at pleasure, upon declaration of their frailty or
weakness, quit their frocks, and betake them∣selves
to another life, which happens often a∣mongst
them. They have their morning and
evening Song, Readings and other Services,
celebrated in their Cloysters every day, and
frequented by their society. They live upon
the Alms and bounty of the King and great
Ones, as also on the fruit which their Church
Lands bring forth; but principally out of the
sweet and labours of the Commonalty, who
unanimously share with them, they sending
every morning some Priests and Clerks out of
their Cloysters, with begging bags to receive
these donations and charity: Besides these
Priests, there are a sort of old Nuns shorn,
lodged in Chappels near the greatest Temples,
who assist very devoutly in all their preach∣ings,
singings, ceremonies, and other Church
services, but all voluntary, being tied to no
rules or prescriptions. These Heathens do
generally believe, (however differing in many
particulars) that there is one upper God, with
many lesser Deities in Heaven, who created
all things: that the Souls of Men are immortal,
and shall be rewarded or punished according


to their merits and actions; the good dwelling
with the God in bliss, whilest the wicked are
tormented by the Devils that seduced them.
Their Religion is principally founded upon
these points, which have been delivered to
them in writing many hundred years since, and
confirmed with the testimony of many holy
men, (whose memory they worship in their
Images, which they have set up like so many
lesser Deities) who by their charity to the
Church, to the poor, and to all things that had
life, they endeavored to merit Heaven, and a∣void
the dreadful punishments of the Devils.
Those that are religious and superstitious in
these, buy ordinarily upon Feast daies, multi∣tudes
of Birds and living Fish, bringing them
to the Temple, and there give them their li∣berty;
esteeming it a great sin to kill not onely
men, but the more rude creatures, fancying the
souls of deceased persons to be transmigrated
into them: all other evils which Nature teaches
us to be sin, they account so too, and are much
preached against by their Priests. The chief
Ceremonies of this Idolatry are, as we said,
preaching, teaching, singing evening and mor∣ning
Prayers, and offering of Sacrifice, which
is done with torches, candles, incense, spices,
and flowers at the altars of their images, which
in their opinion represent the great God, the


lesser Deities, and holy Men, whereby they
think their wrath is appeased; to which end
they celebrate with much solemnity at the
new, full, and quarters of the Moon, as also
several other extraordinary Festivals, with a
fasting from any thing which hath had life, for
three moneths together, they pray for the sick,
and also the dead, who being first superstiti∣ously
shaven, anointed, charmed, and with
much ceremony, as weeping, cutting of the
hair of the head by the next friend, alms, pray∣ers
of the Priests, musick, plays, fire-works,
and other shows (according to the quality and
ability of the deceased) burnt with fire, their
collected ashes are afterwards anointed and
buried near the Temples, a Pyramid rich and
magnificent being erected over them; so that
these funerals are extreamly expensive to the
survivors, as well as honorable for the deceased.
The Priests carry themselves very moderatly
to those of a contrary Religion, condemning
no opinions, but believe that all, though of dif∣fering
tenets, living vertuously, may be saved,
all services which are performed with zeal be∣ing
acceptable to the great God, especially
theirs, they being convinced of its truth and
innocency. This constancy of theirs makes
them not easily to be drawn to any other per∣swasion,
which hath been sufficiently attempt∣ed


by the 
Portugals,
 whose industrious Priests
omitted nothing for their conversion, and by
the Mohometans who are no lesse zealous in
their way, though with little or no success by
either of them, and yet the Christians, as also
the Mahometans, are both permitted the free
exercise of their Religions in their Countrey.
However these Heathen be thus religious, yet
they fear and serve (although contrary to the
opinion of most of their Priests) the very
Devils, whom they believe to be the authours
and causes of all evil, as the Gods are of every
thing that is good and vertuous: They adore
these unclean Spirits in their sicknesses and
misfortunes, celebrating their feasts with in∣struments
playing, and offering attoning sacri∣fices
of fruits and living creatures: They are
so strangely abominable in their gestures and
actions, that it is not fit for a Christian either
to see or write them; thus fondly searching his
favour, whose indulgences do but plunge them
deeper in their unhappy mistakes and errours.
The people of this Countrey are reasonably
well proportioned, brown and tawny; they
are none of the best Souldiers, though proud
and insolent in their victories; they are modest
enough in their civil conversation, though na∣turally
light, fearful, incredulous, dissimuled,
deceitful, and very lying. The men are lazy and


slow, insomuch that the women, with their slaves,
are forced (contrary to the customs of other Na∣tions)
to labour the earth, and do most of their
husbands work, besides taking care for their fa∣milies
and houses, whilest the men follow their
pleasure and divertisements abroad. They clothe
themselves (both men & women) thin, according
to the hot climat they live in; both sexes wear
painted petticoats, the men covering their upper
parts with a short shirt with half-sleeves, and the
women with a thin cloth, both ends hanging over
their shoulders to hide their brests: They wear
for ornaments gold pins in their hair, and rings of
the same mettal on their fingers: This is the or∣dinary
wear, high and low being all of a fashion,
and not distinguishable but by the richness of
their vestments, and the greatness of their trains,
which they much glory in: The Gentry and No∣bles
have many slaves attending them when they
go abroad, some ten, twenty, thirty, or more,
according to their abilities and greatness; and not
a Citizen, or his Wife, stirs in the streets without
one or two of these slaves to wait upon them.
Their houses are builded according to the fashi∣on
in 
India,
 of wood and reeds, and covered with

Coco
 leaves, or tiles; the floors are raised three or
four foot high, their appartements being com∣modious,
though but slenderly furnished, only
for sleeping, and dressing what is necessary for


their refection. Their diet is but mean, as rice,
fish, and herbs; they drink water, though on
Feast daies they indulge more the common peo∣ple,
drinking ordinarily Arak, or Brandy-Wine.


They differ very much in their customs about
marrying; great Persons need nothing but the
consent of their Parents or Friends, (the Priests
not intermedling at all) the ceremony ending in
feasting and rejoycing. Husband and Wife may
part again at pleasure, dealing their goods and
children without further circumstance, and may
re-marry if they think good, without fear of
shame or punishment. A man may keep as many
Concubins as he pleases, besides his Wife, though
they are in some subordinacy to her, whose Chil∣dren
onely inherit, the other being contented
with small portions for their subsistence. Great
mens goods are divided after their deaths into
three parts; one part for the King, the second for
the Priests and their Funerals, and the third for
their Children. The common People have other
Customs; the Bridgroom buyeth his Bride for
a sum of monies of her Father or Friends, where∣upon
the marriage is made and concluded with a
little feasting; but they may divorce, like the great
Ones, at pleasure, and marry again with the same
liberty. The Children deal their deceased parents
goods equally, except some little advantages for
the eldest Son. They have many other Customs


in marriage and succession, too long and tedious
to write. As for their Children, they send them
to school at five or six years old, where they are
taught to write and read, and rendered fit for
Trades and other employments; some are con∣tinued
in their studies by the Priests their Masters,
until they are called to Offices and advancements
in the State, and then they cast off the yellow
frock; others continue there out of hopes of be∣ing
one day Heads of Temples and Schools, or
sharing in the Priesthood.


The 
Siammers,
 who live in Towns and po∣pulous
places, are either Courtiers, Officers, Mer∣chants,
Watermen, Fishermen, Tradesmen, or
Artificers, each one containing himself in his vo∣cation:
The Country people brew, till, plant,
and bring up fwarms of Cattel, as Horses, Kine;
Swine, Deer; and domestick Fowl, as Geefe;
Peacocks, Ducks, Hens, Pigeons, and other
tame creatures, insomuch that provision is very
cheap, notwithstanding the abundance of at
which is sent into the neighbouring Provinces
for their supply and use: They have Brick, Lime,
Wood, and all materials for building of Churches,
Forts, Houses, Ships, Prawes, Jonks, and other
vessels in great quantities. The divers Towns of
this Countrey have their several Trafficks and
Commerce; in the chief City the trading is very
good and free in its course; the principal commo∣dities


are Choromandes and Sura vestments, all
manner of 
China
 wares, Jewels, Gold, Benjamin,
Gumlack, Wax, Sappang, Agerwood, Tin, and
Lead, &c. as also vast numbers of Harts-skins,
one hundred and fifty thousand of these creatures
being caught yearly in this Countrey, and fold
with much profit to the 
Japanners.
 They drive
a great trade with all eating provisions, especially
Rice, many thousand Tuns being transported
yearly by forraigners. This City, by reason of its
great traffick, is frequented by several Nations,
as the 
Indians,
 the more Western 
Asiaticks,
 Eu∣ropean
Moors, and Christian Merchants. The
King himself is also a Merchant, and hath his own
Ships and Factours trading to 
Choromandel
 and

China,
 being for that cause more favoured and
priviledged then any other Prince; he likewise
trafficks to 
Pegu, Ava, Jongoma, Langs-jang,

and other places, besides his negotiations at
home, all which bring him incredible profit, and
no small disturbance to private Merchants, all
which do certainly manifest the great trade that
is carried on in this Countrey. The Monies cur∣rant
is of very fine silver, of a round figure, and
impressed with the Kings picture; the kindes are
a Ticlas, a Mase, and a Fong, worth thirty pence,
seven pence half penny, and four pence English,
or near upon. They reckon ordinarily by 
Cattys,

each being twenty 
Tayls,
 or forty eight Royals


of eight; and it is with this and no other coyn
that they handle and trade with, save that there
is a lesser called 
Schulpkens,
 or little Sheels, wher∣of
eight or nine thousand go to a Fong, being
brought out of 
Manilha, Borneo,
 and 
Lequeo,
 very
useful for poor people.


Before the coming of the Netherlanders into
the 
Indiaes,
 the 
Portugals
 had great correspon∣dence
and amity with this Kingdom, being in such
esteem and honour by the King, that the Embas∣sadours
sent from their Vice-Roys, Governours,
and Bishops of 
Malacca
 in 
India,
 were not only
well received by his Majesty, but richly presented
by him, and many of the residing 
Portugals
 in this
Country advanced to great Offices and prefer∣ments;
they had not only the free exercise of their
Religion, but their chief Priest had also a moneth∣ly
pension allowed him for his more splendid sub∣sistence;
thus they prospered here for many years,
until the Dutch Company got footing amongst
them, and gained upon them from time to time,
by taking their Ships and interrupting their trade,
with 
Santhome
 and 
Nevagatain,
 insomuch that
they are at present very low and out of credit, oc∣casioned
more particularly by their taking of a
Dutch Yacht by a Spanish Gally in the River of

Siam,
 which the King took so highly, that he re∣venged
it with his Arms, which produced a war
between him and 
Manilha;
 and however the



Portugals
 seemed unconcerned in this quarrel,
yet they wholly lost their credit at Court, inso∣much
that the Bishop of 
Malaccas
 Vicar, their
chief Resident there, is debarred of his usual ac∣cess
to his Majesty and his Ministers, whereas in
former times they were esteemed the onely and
chief Merchants of the whole Kingdom. This
breach and difference between these two Nati∣ons,
was fomented by the Dutch, and increased
by several acts of hostility on the 
Portugals
 side,
who took many of his Majesties Ships and Vas∣sals
at Sea; in revenge whereof, the 
Portugal
 Ves∣sels
were seized on in 
India,
 and all the present

Portugals
 natives clapt up in prison, who were
after two years restraint, upon a fictitious em∣bassie,
restored to their liberty; but this practice
coming to light, occasioned the seisure of a 
Ca∣stilian

and a 
Portugal
 Vessel in the Havens of 
Li∣goor

and 
Tanaslary,
 the men whereof were not
released till after a two years restraint; but then
indeed returned with his Majesties Letters to the
Governours of 
Manilha
 and 
Malacca,
 with
invitations of their former peace and traffick,
where it is probable they may return, but questi∣onable
whether they shall ever recover their for∣mer
credit and authority.


It is more then thirty years since the Nether∣landers
came first to 
Siam,
 and were admitted of
by his Majesty; so that the Company have judged


it necessary, for the cherishing their traffick and
alliance with so mighty a Prince, to settle there;
to which end they builded a house, or lodge, of
wood in the City of 
India,
 where they trade in
in land commodities, and selling of clothes, as
also buying of Harts-skins, Sappang, &c. which
are sent yearly to 
Japan:
 the Company indeed
hath not profited much, by reason of several
misfortunes by this traffick; but they have gained
more reputation then any Europians besides, by
the great friendship and correspondence which
is betwixt them and the King; and also have had
the benefit of transporting great quantities of all
sorts of provisions in 
Batamia,
 which friendship,
notwithstanding the several successions of the
Princes, disturbing the Companies Cantore and
Servants, is yet sufficiently conserved and con∣tinued,
and ought in my opinion to be cherished,
as absolutely necessary for the good and welfare
of our Company, as also in regard of the Kings
civil usage of us, and his aversion to the Spani∣ards,
our common enemy; finally our factory
established there in the year 1633. and trading du∣ring
my four years direction, are so much cor∣rected
and increased, that the Company hath re∣markably
gained by them, with probability, with
good mannagement of more signal advantages:
To which end the General and Councel of 
India

caused in 
Anno
 1634. a stone lodge, with fit pack-houses,


pleasant apartements, and a commodious
landing place, to be builded on the borders of
the River 
Menam,
 being one of the conveni∣entest
and best scituated of any that is unfortified
in all the 
Indiaes.


And thus much we found good to discover of
the customes and manners of the Kingdom of

Siam,
 being my observations during my eight
years residence in the chief City of the Country.
I have followed the exact rules of truth, accor∣ding
to my best knowledge and diligence, in this
short relation, remitting the curious to the more
large and more particular discourses of better and
more exact judgements.
