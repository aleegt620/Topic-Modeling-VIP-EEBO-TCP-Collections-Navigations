TO THE RIGHT WOR∣SHIPFVLL,
WORTHY,
and Learned Sir Robert Cot∣ton
of Connington Knight.


T
Emples
 (saith the
auncient 
Aristides)
are to be dedicated to
the Gods, and Bookes
to Good-men.
 Vpon
warrant of which words, and long
experience of your goodnesse,
Right worshipfull, this silly, pit∣tifull,
and poore 
Treatise
 was once
vnaduisedly forward to haue bin
dedicated to your good worship.
But vpon more aduised conside∣ration,
whereas 
Aristides
 in his
wisdome knew nothing but that
which was good, to be seemly and
sortable for goodmen, & therfore
meant most certainly, that onely


good Bookes are to be dedicated
to good men: It recalled it selfe
in good tine, for that it cannot
challenge any such title either for
matter or manner of handling,
being only the rude rubble and
out-cast rubbis
 (as you know)
of a greater and more serious
worke. Whereas therefore nei∣ther
in respect of it selfe it dare,
neither in regarde of you it may
present it selfe by way of De∣dication,
for that should implie
honour vnto you, which it can∣not
bring, and require patronage
from you, which it needeth not,
beeing by the pittifull sillynesse
thereof secured from enuie, one∣lie
reaching at eminencie. I
heere sende it vnto you in lose
leaues, as fitt to be 
Ludibria venti:



and withall submit it to your
censure, not as he did 
Siue legi,
siue tegi iusseris.
 Albeit I assure
my selfe that you in your lear∣ned
iudgement cannot but sen∣tence
it, as I haue done with this
doome.

Britaine


W
Hereas I have purposed in all this Trea∣tise
to confine my selfe within the bounds
of this Isle of 
Britaine,
 it cannot be imper∣tinent,
at the verie enterance, to say some∣what
of 
Britaine,
 which is the onely subiect
of all that is to be said, and well knowne to
be the most flourishing and excellent, most
renowmed and famous Isle of the whole world: So rich in
commodities, so beautifull in situation, so resplendent in all
glorie, that if the most Omnipotent had fashioned the world
round like a ring, as hee did like a globe, it might haue beene
most worthily the onely gemme therein. For the ayre is most
temperate and wholesome, sited in the middest of the tempe∣rate
Zone, subiect to no stormes and tempests as the more
Southerne and Northerne are; but stored with infinite delicate
fowle. For water, it is walled and garded with the Oc
an most
commodious for trafficke to all parts of the world, and wate∣red
with pleasant fishfull and navigable rivers, which yeelde
safe havens and roads, and furnished with shipping and Say∣lers,
that it may rightly be termed the 
Lady of the sea.
 That I
may say nothing of healthfull Bathes, and of Meares stored
both with fish and fowle; The earth fertile of all kinde of
graine, manured with good husbandrie, rich in minerall of
coles, tinne, lead, copper, not without gold and silver, aboun∣dant
in pasture, replenished with cattell both tame and wilde,
(for it hath more par
es than all 
Europe
 besides,) plentifully
wooded, prouided with all complete provisions of Warre,


beautified with many populous Citties, faire Borroughs, good
Townes, and well-built Villages, strong Munitions, magnifi∣cent
Pallaces of the Prince, stately houses of the Nobilitie, fre∣quent
Hospitals, beautiful Churches, faire Colleges, as well in
other places, as in the two Vniversities, which are comparable
to all the rest in Christendome, not onely in antiquitie, but also
in learning, building, and endowments. As for governement
Ecclesiasticall and Civill, which is the very soule of a king∣dome,
I neede to say nothing, whenas I write to home-borne,
and not to strangers.


But to praise
 Britaine 
according as the dignitie thereof re∣quireth
is a matter which may exercise, if not tier the happiest
wit furnished with the greatest variety of learning; and some
already have busied their braines and pennes heerein with no
sma
l labour and travel: let therefore these few lines in this be∣halfe
suffice, out of an antient Writer.
 Britaine, thou art a glori∣ou
sle,
extolled and renowmed among all Nations; the navies of

Tharsis
 can not be compared to thy shipping bringing in all pretious
commodities of the world: the Sea is thy wall, and strong fortificati∣ons
doe secure thy Portes: Chivalrie, Cleargie, and Merchandize do
flourish in thee. The 
P
sans, Genoveses,
 and 
Venetians
 do bring
thee Saphires, Emeraldes and Carbuncles from the East: 
Asia
 ser∣veth
thee with Silke & Purple, 
Affrica
 with Cinamon and Balme,

Spaine
 with Golde, and 
Germanie
 with Silver: Thy Weaver

Flaunders
 dooth drape Cloth for thee of thine owne Wooll; Thy

Gascoigne
 dooth send thee Wine:
 Bucke and Doe are plentifull in
thy Forrests: Droves of Cattle, and Flockes of Sheepe are vpon thy
Hilles: All the perfection of the goodiust 
and is in thee: Thou hast
all the Foule of the aire. In plenty of Fish thou doost surpasse all
Regions. And albeit thou art not stretched out with large limites,
yet bordering Nations clothed with thy Fleeces, doe woonder at
thee for thy blessed plenty. Thy Swordes have beene turned into
Plow-shares: Peace and Religion flourish in thee; so that thou arte
a Mirrour to all Christian Kingdomes.


Adde heerevnto (if you please) these few lines out of a farre
more antient
 Panegyrist 
in the time of
 Constantine 
the Great.

O happy 
Britaine
 and more blisfull then all other Regions: Nature


hath enriched thee with all commodities of heaven and earth,
wherein there is neither extreame colde in Winter, nor scorch∣ing
heate in Summer; wherein there is such aboundant plenty
of Corne, as may suffice both for Bread and Wine: wherein are
Woodes without wilde Beasts, and the Fields without noysome
Serpents; but infinite numbers of milch Cattle, and Sheepe
weighed downe with rich Fleeces: And that which is most com∣fortable,
long dayes, and lightsome nights.


So that, not without cause, it was accounted one of the
fairest and most glorious Plumes in the triumphant Dia∣deme
of the Roman Empire, while it was a Province vn∣der
the same;
 and was truely called by 
Charles
 the Great,

The Store-house, and Granary of the whole westerne world.


But whereas the saide 
Panegyrist
 falleth into a gladsome
admiration, how from hence there hath risen gratious prin∣ces,

As good gods honoured throughout the whole world.
 That
if ever, as it was lately to our glorious ioy evidently, & effe∣ctually
verified in our late Soveraigne, of most deare, sacred
and ever-glorious memorie QV
ENE ELIZABETH, the ho∣nour
of her time, and the mirrour of succeeding ages: so
with an assured confidence, wee hope it will likewise bee
prooved true in her vndoubted and rightfull successor, our
dread Lord and Soveraigne. That to his endlesse honour
MERCIE and TRVTH, RIGHTEOVSNES and PEACE may
heere kisse together; and true RELIGION, with her atten∣dants
IOY, HAPPINES, and GLORY, may heere for ever
seate themselves vnder him; in whose person the two migh∣tie
kingdomes of 
England
 and 
Scotland
 hitherto severed, are
now conioyned, and beginne to close together into one, in
their most antient name of BRITAINE.


If any would vndertake the honour and precedence of

Britaine
 before other Realmes in serious maner (for heere
I protest once for all, I will passe over each thing lightly &
slightly) a world of matter at the first view would present
it selfe vnto him. As that the true Christian Religion was
planted heere most auntiently by 
Ioseph
 of 
Arimathia, Si∣mon
Zelotes, Aristobulus,
 yea by saint 
Peter,
 and saint 
Paul,



as may be prooved by 
Dorotheus, Theod
, Sophronius,

& before the yere of Christ 200. it was propagated, as 
Ter∣tullian

writes to places of 
Britaine 
accessa Ro
anis,
 whither
the 
Romans
 never reached, which can not be vnderstoode,
but of that parte which was afterward called 
Scotland.
 The
kingdomes also are most auntient, helde of God alone, ac∣knowledging
no superiours, in no vassalage to Emperour
or Pope.
 The power of the Kings more absolute, than in
most other kingdomes, their territories very large; for the
Kings of 
England,
 beside 
Ireland,
 have commaunded from
the Isles of 
Orkenay,
 to the 
Pyrene
 Mountaines, and are 
de
iure,
 Kings of all 
France
 by descent. The Kings of 
Scot∣land,

beside the ample realm of 
Scotland
 commands the 300
Westerne Isles, the 30. of 
Orkney
 & 
Schetland.
 Also, which
was accounted a special note of maiesty in former ages, the
Kings of 
England,
 with them of 
Fraunce, Ierusalem, Naples,

and afterward 
Scotland,
 were antiently the onely annointed
Kings of Christendome: which manner beganne among
the 
Iewes,
 was recontinued at length by the Christian Em∣perors
of 
Constantinople,
 with this word at the annoynting,

,
 that is, 
Be holy;
 and 
, 
Be worthie;

and from thence was that sacred ceremonie brought to vs
and the other kingdomes.


As for that admirable gift hereditary to the annoynted
Princes of this Realme,
 in curing the 
Kings Evil,
 I referre
you to the learned Discourse thereof lately written. Ney∣ther
would it be forgotten, that 
England
 in the opinion of
the Popes (when they swayd the world, and their authori∣tie
was held sacred) was preferred, because it contained in
the Ecclesiasticall Division, two large Provinces, which
had their severall 
Legatinati,
 whereas 
Fraunce
 had scantly
one, That 
Scotland
 was by them accompted an exempt
kingdome,
 and a Peculiar properly appertaining to the 
Ro∣man
Chappell.
 And which was accompted in that age a
matter of honour, when all Christianitie in the Counsell

Constance
 was divided into Nations, 
Anglicana Natio
 was
one of the principall and no sub alterne. As also, that in times


past, the Emperour was accounted 
Maior filius Ecclesiae,
 the
King of 
France, Filius Minor,
 and the King of 
England, Fi∣lius
Tertius,
 and 
Adoptivus.
 And so in generall Councells,
as the King of 
Fraunce
 had place next the Emperour on
the right hand, so the King of 
England
 on the left; and the
Kings of 
Scotland,
 as appeereth in an antient Roman Pro∣vinciall,
had next place before 
Castil
.
 The Archbishops
of 
Canterbury,
 who were antiently stiled 
Archbishoppes of
Britaine,
 were adiudged by the Popes, 
tanquam alterius or∣bis
Pontifices Maximi,
 and they had their place in all general
Councells, at the Popes right foote. The Title also of 
De∣fensor
fidei,
 is as honourable, and more iustly conferred vp∣on
the Kings of 
England,
 than, either 
Christianissimus
 vpon
the French, or 
Catholicus
 vpon the Spaniard. Neither is it
to be omitted, which is so often recorded in our Histories,
when 
Brithwald
 the Monke, not long before the Conquest
busied his brain much about the succession of the Crown,
because the blood Royall was almost extinguished, he had
a strange vision, and heard a voyce, which forbade him to
be inquisitive of such matters, resounding in his eares. 
The
kingdome of
 England 
is Gods owne kingdome, and for it God
himselfe will provide.
 But these, & such like are more fit for a
graver Treatise than this. I will performe that I promi∣sed,
in handling nothing seriously, and therfore I will bring
you in some Poets, to speake in this behalfe for mee, and
will beginne with olde 
Alfred
 of 
Beverlie,
 who made this for

Britaine
 in generall, which you must not reade with a cen∣sorious
eye; for it is, as the rest I will cite, of the middle age,
having heeretofore vsed all of more auntient and better
times in an other worke. But thus saide he of 
Britaine.


Insula praedives quae toto vix eget orbe,


Et cuius totus indiget orbis ope.


Insula praedives, cuius miretur, & optet,


Delicias Salomon, Octavianus opes.


For 
Scotland,
 one lately in a far higher straine, and more
Poetically, sung these;



Quis tibi frugifera 
,


Aut aris gravides, & 
 p
dere 
,


Et nitidos auro monces, ferr
{que} rigent


De{que} met all
feris manantia 
:


Quae{que} bea
t alias communia commoda g
tes


For 
England
 a very olde 
Epigr
tist
 made these with a

Prosopopoeia
 of Nature, the indulgent mother to 
England,

which doth comprise as much as the best wittes can nowe
conceive in that behalfe.


Anglia terra ferax, tibi pax secura quietem,


Multiplicem luxum merx opulenta dedit.


Tu nimio nec stricta gelu, nec sydere fervens.


Clementi coelo, temperie{que} places.


Cùm pareret Natura parens, vario{que} favore,


Divideret dotes omnibus vna locis:


Seposuit potiora tibi, matrem{que} professa


Insula fis 
oelix, plena{que} pacis, 
t.


Quicquid amat luxus, quicquid desiderat vsus,


Ex t
 proveniet, vel aliunde tibi.


Accordingly it is written in the Blacke booke of the Ex∣chequer,
that our Auncestors termed 
England,
 a Store-house
of Treasure, and a Paradise of Pleasure, in this verse;

Divitijs{que} sinum, delicijs{que} larem.


So that not without cause Pope 
Innocentius
 the fourth,

most willingly, and especially desired to see 
Divitias Londi∣ni,
& delicias Westmonasterij.
 In these respects, to conclude,
most truely our 
Lucan
 singeth of this our countrey;


The fairest Land, that from her thrusts the rest,


As if she car'd not for the world beside,


A world within herselfe vvith vvonders blest.








The inhabitants of Britaine


A
S all the Regions with the whole worlds
frame, and all therein was created by the
Almightie,
 for his last and most perfect
worke, that goodly, vpright, provident,
subtile, wittie, and reasonable creature,
which the Greekes call 
, for his
vpright looke; the Latines 
Homo,
 for that he was made of

Molde;
 and we with the Germains, call Man of his princi∣pall
part, the mind, being the verie image of God, and a pet∣tie
world within himselfe: so he assigned in his divine pro∣vidence,
this so happy and worthy a region to men of an∣swerable
worth, if not surpassing, yet equalling the most
excellent inhabitants of the earth, both in the endowments
of minde, lineaments of bodie, and their deportment
both in peace and warre, as if I would enter into discourse
I could very easily shew.


But overpassing their naturall inclination by heauenly
influence,
 answerable to the disposition of 
Aries, Leo,
 and

Sagittary,
 & 
Iupiter,
 with 
Mars
 Dominators for this North∣west
part of the world, which maketh them impatient of
servitude, lovers of libertie, martiall and couragious. I will
only in particular note somewhat, and that summarily of the
Britaines, Scottish, and English, the three principall inhabi∣tants.


The Britaines,
 the most antient people of this Isle anti∣ently
inhabited the same from sea to sea, whose valour and
prowes is renowned both in Latine & Greek monuments,
and may appeare in these two points which I will heere


onely note. First that the most p
ssant Roman forces,
when they were at the highest, could not gaine of them, be∣ing
but then a halfe-naked people,
 in thirtie whole yeares
the countries from the Thames to 
Str
ling.
 And when
they had gained them, and brought them into forme of a
province, they found them so warlike a people, that the Ro∣manes
levied as many Cohorts,
 companies, and ensignes of
Britans from hence for the service of 
Armenia, Aegypt,
Illyricum,
 their frontire Countries, as from any other of
their Provinces whatsoeuer.
 As for those Britane which
were farther North, and after as is most probable, called

Pictes,
 (for that they still painted themselues when the Sou∣therne
parts were brought to civilitie,) they not onely most
couragiously defended their libertie, but offended the Ro∣mans
with continuall and most dangerous incursions. The
other remainder of the Britans, which retyred themselues
to west parts, now called 
W
es,
 with like honour of forti∣tude,
for many hundred yeares repelled the yoake both of
the English and Norman slaverie. But since they were 
∣ted
to the imperiall Crowne of 
England,
 they have, to their
iust praise, performed all parts of dutifull loyaltie and allegi∣ance
most faithfully therevnto.] Great also is the glorie
of those Britans,
 which in most dolefull time of the English
invasion, with-drew themselves into the West parts of 
Gal∣lia,

then called 
Armorica:
 For they not onely seated them∣selves,
there maugre the Romans, (then indeede low, and
neare setting,) and the French: but also imposed their name
to the countrey, held and defended the same against the
French, vntill in our grandfathers memorie, it was vnited
to 
France
 by the sacred bonds of matrimonie.]


Next after the Britans,
 the Scottishmen comming out of

Ireland,
 planted themselves in this Islco
 the North side of

Cluid,
 partly by force, partly by fauour of the Pictes, with
whom a long time they annoyed the Southerne parts, but
after many blody battels amongst themselves, the Scottish∣men
subdued them, and established a kingdome in those
parts, which with 
 courag
 and warlike prowesse,


they have not onely maintained at home, but also hath pur∣chased
great honour abroad. For the French cannot but ac∣knowledge
they have seldome atchieved any honourable
acts without Scottish hands, who therefore are deservedly
to participate the glorie with them. As also divers parts of

France, Germany,
 and 
Suitzerland,
 cannot but confesse, that
they owe to the Scottish Nation, the propagation of good
letters and Christian religion amongst them.


After the Scottishmen, the Angles, Englishmen or Sax∣ons,
by Gods wonderfull providence were transplanted hi∣ther
out of 
Germanie.
 A people composed of the valiant

Angles, Iutes,
 and 
Saxons,
 then inhabiting 
Iutland, 
olsten,

and the sea coasts along to the river 
Rhene,
 who in short
time subduing the Britans, and driving them into the
mountanous Westerne parts, made themselves by a most
compleate conquest, absolute Lords of all the better soyle
thereof, as farre as 
Orkeney.
 Which cannot be doubted of,
when their English tongue reacheth so farre along the East
coast, vnto the farthest parts of 
Scotland,
 and the people
thereof are called by the 
Highland-men,
 which are the true
Scots, by no other name then 
Saxons,
 by which they also
call vs the English.


This warlike, victorious, stiffe, stowt, and rigorous Na∣tion,
after it had as it were taken roote heere about one hun∣dred
and sixtie yeares, and spread his branches farre and
wide, being mellowed and mollified by the mildenes of the
soyle and sweete aire, was prepared in fulnes of time for the
first spirituall blessing of God, I meane our regeneration in
Christ, and our ingrafting into his mysticall bodie by holy
baptisme. Which 
Beda
 our Ecclesiastical Historian recoun∣teth
in this manner, and I hope you will give it the reading.

Gregorie
 the Great Bishop of 
Rome,
 on a time saw beautifull
boyes to befold in the market at 
Rome,
 & demanded from
whence they were▪ answer was made him out of the Isle of

Britaine
 Then asked he againe, whither they were Christians
or no
 they said no. 
Alas for pittie said
 Gregorie, 
that the soule

 be Lord of such faire folkes▪ and that they which


carrie such grace in their 

in their hearts.
 Then he would know of them by what name
their Nation was called, and they told him 
, And
iustly be they so called
 (quoth he,) 
for they haue Angelike faces,
and seeme meete to be made cohair
 with the Angells in hea∣ven.


Since which time, they made such happy progresse in
the Christian profession both of faith and works, that if I
should but enter into consideration thereof, I should be
over-whelmed with mayn tides of matter. Many and ad∣mirable
monuments thereof, do every where, at home pre∣sent
themselves to your view, erected informer times, (and
no small number in our age, although few men note them,)
not for affectation of 
ame, or ostentation of wealth, but to
the glorie of God, increase of faith, of learning and to main∣tenance
of the poore. As for abroad, the world ca
 testifie
that foure Englishmen have converted to Christianitie,
eight Nations of 
Europe, Wi
frid alias Boniface,
 the D
∣shire-man
converted the German 
Saxons, Franc
ns Hos∣sians,

and 
Thuringians, Willebred
 the Northerne man, the
Frisians and Hollanders. 
Nicholas Braksp
 of 
Middlesex,

who was after called Pope 
Hadrian
 the 
Normegians,
 and not
long since, 
Thomas
 of 
W
lden
 of 
Essex,
 the 
Lit
ians.

Neither will I heere note which strangers have noted, that

England
 hath bred more Princes renowned for sanctitie,
then any Christian Nation whatsoever. It doth also re∣dound
to the eternall honour of 
England,
 that our countri∣men
have twice beene schoolemaist 
 
France.
 First
when they taught the 
Gaules
 the discipline of the 

and after, when they and the Scottishmen first taught the
French the liberall Arts, and persuaded 
Carelus Magnus
 to
found the Vniversitie of 
Paris.
 They also brought into

Fraunce
 the best lawes which the Parl
ament of 
 and

Burdeaux
 have now in vse.
 They at the lowest ebbe of lear∣ning,
amazed the world with their excellent knowledge
in Philosophie, and Divinitie: for that I may not 

of 
Alexander
 of 
Hales,
 the 
 Schoole∣master


to the 
 Doctor 
Thomas Aq
,
 one Col∣ledge
in 
Oxford
 brought forth in one age those foure lights
of learning:
 
Sco
us
 the 
Subtile, Bradward
ne
 the 
Profound,
Okham
 the 
Invincible,
 and 
Burley
 the 
Perspicuous,
 and as some
say, 
Baconthorpe
 the 
Resolute;
 which Titles they hadde
by the common consent of the iudiciall and learned of that
and the succeeding ages. Yet their militarie glorie hath sur∣passed
all, for they have terrified the whole world with
their Armes in 
Syria, Aegypt, Cyprus, Spaine, Sicill,
 and 
India.


They have traversed with most happy victories both

France
 and 
Scotland,
 brought away their Kings captives,
conquered 
Ireland
 and the Isle of 
Cypres,
 which King 
Ri∣chard

the first gave frankly to 
Guie
 of 
Lusigni
,
 and lately
with a maidens hand, mated the mightiest Monarch in his
owne Countries. They beside many other notable disco∣veries,
twice compassed the whole globe of the earth with
admirable successe, which the Spaniards have yet but once
performed. Good Lord, how spaciously might a learned
pen walke in this argument! But lest I should seeme over
prodigall in the praise of my countrimen, I will onely pre∣sent
you with some few verses in this behalfe, and first this
Latine Rythme of the middle time in praise of the English
Nation, with some close cautions. Its quilted as 
t were out
of shreds of divers Poets, such as Schollers do call a 
Cento.

The Languages.


F
Rom the people we will now proceede to
the languages. Heere would Schollers
shew you the first confusion of langua∣ges
out of 
Moses,
 that the gods had their
peculiar tongue out of 
H
er,
 that brute
beasts, birdes, and fishes, had their owne
proper languages out of 
Clemens Alexandri
.
 They
would teach you out of 
Euphorus,
 that there were but 52.


tongues in the world, because so many soules out of 
Iacob

descended into 
Aegypt,
 and out of 
Arnobius,
 that there were
seaventie and two: Albeit 
Timosthenes
 reporteth that in

Dioscurias
 a mart towne of 
Colchis,
 their trafficked 300.
Nations of divers languages: And howsoever our 
Indian
 or

American
 discouerers say, that in every fourescore mile in

America,
 and in every valley almost of 
Peru
 you shall finde
a new language. Neither would they omit the Iland where
the people have cloven tongues out of the fabulous 
Narra∣tions

of 
Diodorus Siculus:
 yea, they would lash out of the 
Vto∣pian

language with

Volvola Barchin hema
, la lalvola drame pagloni.

whenas it is a greater glory now to be a 
Linguist,
 then a 
Re∣alist.

They would moreover discourse at large, which I will
tell you in a word. First the British tongue or Welsh (as we
now call it) was in vse onely in this Island,
 having great af∣finitie
with the olde 
Galliqua
 of 
Gaule,
 now 
Fraunce,
 from
whence the first inhabitants in all probability came hither.
Afterward the 
Latin
 was taken vp when it was brought in∣to
the forme of a Proviner, about the time of 
Domitian,
 ac∣cording
to that notable place of 
Tacitus,
 where he report∣teth
that 
Iulius Agricola
 Governour heere for the 
Romans,

preferred the 
Britans,
 as able to doe more by witte, then the

Gaules
 by studie: 
Vt qui
 (saieth he) 
modò linguam Romanam
abnuebant, eloquentiam concupiscerent. Inde etiam habitus no∣stri
honor & frequens toga.
 But the 
British
 overgrewe the

Latine,
 and continueth yet in 
Wales,
 and some villages of

Cornwall
 intermingled with some 
Provinciall Latine.
 After
the Irish tongue was brought into the Northwest partes of
the Isle, out of 
Ireland
 by the auntient Scottishmen, and
there yet remaineth. Lastly, the 
English-Saxon
 tongue came
in by the 
English-Saxons
 ont of 
Germany,
 who valiantly and
wisely performed heere all the three things, which implie a
full conquest, viz. the alteration of lawes, language, and at∣tire.


This English tongue extracted out of the olde 
German,

as most other from 
Island
 to the 
Alpes,
 is mixed as it is now,


of the olde 
English-Saxon
 & 
N

of 
Latine, German,
 and the olde 
 the 
 La∣tine

and 
German-Gotish,
 and the 
Spanish
 of 
Latine, Gotish-German

and 
Arabique, Saracen,
 or 
M
r
sq
.
 And to the
honour of our progenitors the 
English-Saxons
 be it spoken,
their conquest was more absolute heere over the 
Brita
s,

than either of the 
Francs
 in 
Fran
c
 over the 
G
l
s,
 or the

Gothes
 and 
Lombardes
 in 
Italie
 over the 
K
,
 or of the

Gothes, Vandales,
 and 
Moores
 over the auntient 
Spaniards

in 
Spaine.
 For in these nations much of the provinciall La∣tine
(I meane the Latine vsed whilest they were Provinces
of the 
Romans
) remaineth, which they politi
ely had spread
over their Empire, by planting of Colonies and enfranchi∣sing
all Nations subiect vnto them. But the 
English-Saxon

conquerors, altred the tongue which they found here who∣ly:
so that no 
British
 words, or provinciall 
Latine
 appeared
therein at the first: & in short time they spread it over this
whole 
Iland,
 from the 
Orcades
 to Isle of 
Wight,
 except a few
barren corners in the 
Western
 parts, wherevnto the reliques
of the 
Britans
 and 
Scots
 retyred, reserving in them both their
life and their language. For certainely it is that the greatest
and best parts, the East and South of 
Scotland,
 which call
themselves the 
Lawland-men,
 speake the English tongue va∣ried
onely in 
Dialect,
 as descended from the 
English-Saxons:

and the old 
Scottish,
 which is the verie 
Irish,
 is vsed onely by
them of the West, called the 
Hechtland-men,
 who call the
other as the Welsh call vs 
Sassons, Saxons,
 both in respect of
language and originall, as I shewed before.


I dare not yet heere affirme for the antiquitie of our lan∣guage,
that our great-great-great-grandsires tongue came
out of 
Persia,
 albeit the wonderfull Linguist 
Ioseph Scaliger

hath observed, 
Fader; Moder, Bruder, 
 &c.
 in the 
Pers

tongue in the very sence as we now vse th
.


It will not be vnproper I hope to this purpose, if I note
out of the epistles of that learned Ambassadour 
Busbeq
,

how the inhabitants of 
Taurica-Ch
rson
ssus,
 in the vtter-most
part of 
Europe
 eastward, have these words, 
Wind, Sil∣ver,


Kor
, Sak, Fish, Son, Apple, Waggen, Singen, 
, Beard,

with many other in the very same sence and signification,
as they now are in vse with vs, whereat I mervailed not a
little when I first read it. But nothing can bee gathered
thereby, but that the 
Saxons
 our progenitours, which plan∣ted
themselves heere in the West, did also to their glorie
place 
Colonies
 likewise there in the east.


As in the Latine tongue, the learned make in respect of
time, foure 
Idioms,
 the 
Antient,
 the 
Latine,
 the 
Roman,
 the

Mixt:
 so we in ours may make the 
Antient English-Saxon,
 and
the 
Mixt.
 But that you may seeme how powerable time is
in altering tongues as all things else, I will set downe the
Lords prayer as it was translated in sundrie ages, that you
may see by what degrees our tongue is risen, and thereby
coniecture how in time it may alter and fall againe.


If we could set it downe in the antient 
Saxon,
 I meane
in the tongue which the English vsed at their first arrivall
heere, about 420. yeares after Christs birth, it would seeme
most strange and harsh Dutch or Gebrish, as women call
it; or when they first embraced Christianitie, about the
yeare of Christ 600. But the antientst that I can finde, was
about 900. yeare since, about the yeare of Christ 700.
found in an antient 
Saxon,
 glossed 
Evangelists
 in the hands
of my good friend M. 
Robert Bowyer,
 written by 
Eadfride

the eight Bishop of 
Lindiffar
,
 (which after was translated
to 
Durrham,
) and divided according to the antient 
Canon
 of

Eusebius,
 not into chapters, for 
Stephen Langton,
 Archbishop
of 
Canturburie,
 first divided the holy Scriptures into chap∣ters,
as 
Robert Stephan
 did lately into verse; and thus it is.

About an hundred and three score yeeres after, in the
time of king. 
Henry
 the second, I find this in time sent from



Rome
 by Pope 
Adrian
 an Englishman, to be taught to the
people.


Ʋre fadyr in heaven rich,


Thy name be halyed everlich:


Thou bring vs thy michell blisse,

As wee forgivet vch other mon:


Ne let ous fall into no founding,


Ac sheild ous fro the fowle thing. Amen.


Neither was there any great variation in the time of king

by the Character;

In the time of king 
Richard
 the second about a hundred
and odde yeeres after, it was so mollified, that it came to be
thus, as it is in the Translation of 
Wickliffe,
 with some La∣tine
wordes now inserted, whereas there was not one be∣fore.


Our fadyr, that art in heaven, halloed be thy name,

and in erth: gif to vs this day our bread over other

Hitherto will our sparkefull Youth laugh at their great
grandfathers 
English,
 who had more care to do well, than to
speake minion-like, and l
ft m
re glory to vs by th
ir ex∣ploiting
of great actes, than we shall do by our sonnetting.


Great verily was the glory of our tongue before the 
Nor∣man

Conquest in this, that the olde 
English
 could expresse
most aptly, all the conceiptes of the minde in their owne
tongue without borrowing from any. As for example:


The holy service of God, which the 
Latines
 called 
Religi∣on,

because it knitted the mindes of men together, and most
people of 
Europe
 have borrowed the same from them, they
called most significantly 
Fan-fastnes,
 as the one and onely
assurance and fast anker-holde of our soules health.


The gladsome tidings of our salvation, which the 
Greekes

called 
Evangelion,
 and other Nations in the same word, they
called 
Godspel,
 that is, 
God speech.


For our 
Saviour,
 which wee borrowed from the 
French,

and they from the 
Latin Salvator,
 they called in their owne
word, 
Haelend
 from 
Hael,
 that is, 
Salus,
 safetie, which we

tame still in 
Al-hael,
 and 
Was-hael,
 that is, 
Ave, Salve, Sis
salvus.


They could call the disciples of Christ,
 
Leorning Cnibtas,

that is, 
Learning Servitours.
 For 
 which is now a name
of worship, signified with them an 
Attendant,
 or servitour.


They could name the 
Pharises
 according to the 
Hebrew,
Sunder-halgens,
 as holy religious men which had sundred
and severed themselves from other.


The Scribes they could call in their proper significati∣on,
as 
Booke-men, Bocer.
 So they called parchment which
wee have catcht from the Latine 
Pergamenum, Boc-fell
 in
respect of the vse.


So they could call the sacrament 
Haligdome,
 as holy
iudgement. For so it is according as we receive it.



They could call 
Fortilitie
 and fruitfulnesse of land sig∣nificatively

Eordes-wela,
 as wealth of the earth.


They could call a 
Comet,
 a 
Faxed starre;
 which is all one
with 
Stella Crinita,
 or 
Cometa.
 So they did call the iudge∣ment
seate 
Domesettle.


That which we call the 
Parlament
 of the 
French Parier

to speake, they called a 
Witten mot,
 as the meeting and as∣sembly
of wise men.


The certaine and inward knowledge of that which is
in our minde, be it good or bad, which in the Latine word
we call 
Conscience,
 they called 
Inwit,
 as that which they
did inwardly wit and wote, that is, know certainely.


That in a river which the Latines call 
Alveus,
 and 
Cana∣
is,

and from thence most nations of 
Europe
 name the 
Cha∣nel,
Kanel, Canale, &c.
 they properly called the 
Streame∣race.


Neither in the degrees of kinred they were destitute of
significative woordes; for he whom we of a 
French
 & 
En∣glish

compound word call 
Grandfather,
 they called 
Eald-fa∣der,

whom we call 
Great Grandfather,
 they called 
Thirda∣fader.

So 
Proavus,
 which we call 
Great Great Grandfather,

they called 
Fortha-fader,
 as 
Abavus, Fiftha-fader.


An 
Eunuch,
 for whome we have no name, but from the

Greekes,
 they could aptly name 
Vnstana,
 that is, without
stones, as we vse 
Vnspotted
 for without spotte, 
Vnlearned,
 for,
without learning.


A Covetous man whome we so call of the 
French Con∣voitise,

they truely called 
Git-sor,
 as a fore & eagre 
Getter,
 and

Gatherer.


That which the Latines call 
Abortus,
 and wee in many
wordes, 
Vntimely Birth,
 or, 
Borne before the full time,
 they
called 
Miss-borne.


A 
Porter,
 which wee have received from the 
French,

they could in their own word as significatively call 
A Dore∣ward.


I could particulate in many more, but this woulde ap∣peare
most plentifully, if the labours of the learned Gen∣tlemen


Maister 
Laurence Nowell
 of 
Lincolnes Inne,
 who first
in our time recalled the studie heereof, Maister 
William
Lambert,
 Maister 
I: Ioscelin,
 Maister 
Fr: Tate
 were once
published. Otherwise it is to bee feared, that devouring

Time,
 in few yeeres will vtterly swallow it, without hope
of recoverie.


The alteration and innovation in our tongue as in all o∣thers,
hath beene brought in by entrance of Strangers, as

Danes, Normans,
 and others which have swarmed hither, by
trafficke, for new words as well as for new wares, have al∣waies
come in by the tyranne 
Time,
 which altereth all vn∣der
heaven, by 
Vse,
 which swayeth most, and hath an abso∣lute
command in words, and by 
Pregnant wits:
 specially since
that learning after long banishment, was recalled in the
time of King 
Henry
 the eight, it hath beene beautified and
enriched out of other good tongues, partly by enfranchi∣sing
and endenizing strange words, partly by refining and
mollifying olde words, partly by implanting new wordes
with artificiall composition, happily containing themselves
within the bounds prescribed by 
Horace.
 So that our long
is (and I doubt not but hath beene) as copious, pithie, and
significative, as any other tongue in 
Europe:
 and I hope we
are not yet and shall not heereafter come to that which 
Se∣neca

saw in his time,
 
When mens mindes beginne once to iniure
themselves to dislike whatsoever is vsuall, is disdained. They af∣fect
noveltie in speech, they recall forworne and vncuth words,
they forge new phrases, and that which is newest, is best liked;
there is presumptuous and farre fetching of words. And some
there are which thinke it a grace if their speech doe hover,
and thereby hold the hearer in suspence:
 you know what fol∣loweth.


Omitting this, pardon me and thinke me not overbal∣lanced
with affection, if I thinke that our 
English
 tongue
is (I will not say as sacred as the 
Hebrew,
 or as learned as the

Greeke,
) but as fluent as the 
Latine,
 as courteous as the 
Spa∣nish,

as courtlike as the 
French,
 and as amorous as the 
Italian,

as some Italianated amorous have confessed. Neither hath


any thing detracted more from the dignitie of our tongue,
than our owne affection of forraine tongues, by admiring,
praising, and studying them above measure: whereas the
wise 
Romans
 thought no small part of their honour to con∣sist
in the honour of their language, esteeming it a disho∣nour
to answer any forraine in his owne language. As for
a long time the English placed in the Borrough townes of

Ireland
 and 
Wales,
 would admit neither Irish nor Welsh a∣mong
them. And not long since for the honour of our na∣tive
tongue, 
Henry Fitz-Allan
 Earle of 
Arundell,
 in his tra∣vaile
into 
Italie,
 and the Lord 
William Howard
 of 
Effing∣ham,

in his government of 
Calice,
 albeit they were not igno∣rant
of other forraine tongues, would answer no strangers
by word or writing, but onely in English. As in this consi∣deration
also before them Cardinall 
Wolsey
 in his ambas∣sage
into 
France,
 commaunded all his servaunts to vse no
French, but meere English to the French, in all communica∣tion
whatsoever.


As for the 
Monosyllables
 so rife in our tongue which were
not so originally, although they are vnfitting for verses and
measures, yet are they most fit for expressing briefly the first
conceipts of the minde, or 
Intentionalia
 as they call them in
schooles: so that we can set downe more matter in fewer
lines, than any other language. Neither do we or the Welsh
so curtall 
Latine,
 that we make all therein 
Monosyllables,
 as

Ioseph Scaliger
 chargeth vs;
 who in the meane time forget∣teth
that his Frenchmen have put in their 
Proviso
 in the e∣dict
of 
Pacification
 in the 
Grammaticall
 warre, that they
might not pronounce 
Latine
 distinctly, as the English com∣mon
Lawyers obtained then a 
Reservation
 that they might
write false 
Latine,
 and the Irish not to observe quantitie of
syllables. I cannot yet but confesse that we have corruptly
contracted most names both of men and places, if they were
of more then two sillables, and thereby hath ensued no lit∣tle
obscuritie.


Whereas our tongue is mixed, it is no disgrace, whe
as
all the tongues of 
Europe
 doe participate interchangeably


the one of the other, and in the learned tongues, there hath
been like borrowing one from another.
 Yet is it false which

Gesner
 affirmeth, that our tongue is the most mixt and cor∣rupt
of all other. For if it may please any to compare but the
Lords Prayer in other languages, he shall finde as few 
La∣tine

and borrowed forraine words in ours, as in any other
whatsoever. Notwithstanding the diversiue of Nations
which have swarmed hither, and the practise of the Nor∣mans,
who as a monument of their Conquest, would have
yoaked the English vnder their tongue, as they did vnder
their command, by compelling them to teach their children
in schooles nothing but French, by setting downe their
lawes in the Norman-French, and enforcing them most ri∣gorously
to pleade and to be impleaded in that tongue one∣ly,
for the space of three hundred yeares, vntill K. 
Edward

the third enlarged them first from that bondage. Since which
time, our language hath risen by little, and the proverbe pro∣ved
vntrue, which so long had beene vsed, 
Iacke would be a
gentleman, if he could speake any French.


Heerein is a notable argument of our Ancestors sted∣fastnes
in esteeming and retaining their owne tongue. For
as before the Conquest they misliked nothing more in K.

Edward
 the Confessor, than that he was Frenchified, & ac∣counted
the desire of forraine language, then to be a fore∣token
of the bringing in of forraine powers, which indeede
happened. In like manner after the Conquest, notwithstan∣ding
those enforcements of the Normans in supplanting it,
and the nature of men, which is most pliable with a curious
iolitie to fashion & frame themselves according to the man∣ners,
attyre, and language of the Conquerours. Yet in all
that long space of 300. yeares, they intermingled very few
French-Norman words, except some termes of law, hun∣ting,
hawking, and dicing, whenas wee within these 60.
yeares, have incorporated so many Latine and French, as
the third part of our tongue consisteth now in them. But
like themselves, continue still those old Englishmen which
were planted in 
Ireland,
 in 
Fingall,
 & the Country of 
Weys∣ford,



in the time of K. 
Henry
 the second, who yet still conti∣nue
their antient attyre and tongue, in somuch that an En∣glish
gentleman not long since, sent thither in Commssion
among them, said that he would quickly vnderstand the
Irish, when they spake the antient English. So that our An∣cestors
seemed in part as iealous of their native language, as
those 
B
itans
 which passed hence into 
Armorica
 in 
France,

and marrying strange women there, did cut out their tongs,
lest their children should corrupt their language with their
motters tongues, or as the 
Germans
 which have most of all
Nations opposed themselves against all innovations in ha∣bite,
and language.


Whereas the 
Hebrew Rabbines
 say, and that truly, that
Nature hath given man five instruments for the pronoun∣cing
of all letters, the lips, the teeth, the tongue, the palate,
and throate; I will not denie but some among vs do pro∣nounce
more fully, some flatly, some broadly, and no few
mincingly, offending in defect, excesse, or change of letters,
which is rather to be imputed to the persons and their edu∣cation,
than to the language. Whenas generally wee pro∣nounce
by the confession of strangers, as sweetely, smooth∣ly,
and moderately, as any of the Northerne Nations of the
world, who are noted to soupe their words out of the throat
with fat and full spirits.


This variety of pronuntiation hath brought in some di∣versitie
of Orthographie, and heere-vpon Sir 
Iohn Price,
 to
the derogation of our tongue, and glorie of his 
Welsh,
 re∣porteth
that a sentence spoken by him in 
English,
 & penned
out of his mouth by foure good Secretaries, severally, for tri∣al
of our Orthography, was so set downe by them, that they
all differed one from the other in many letters: whereas so
many 
Welsh
 writing the same likewise in their tongue vari∣ed
not in any one letter at all. Well, I will not derogate from
the good Knights credite; yet it hath beene seene where
tenne English writing the same sentence, have all so con∣curred,
that among them all there hath beene no other
difference, than the adding, or omitting once or twice of


our silent 
E,
 in the end of some wordes. As for the 
Welsh,

I could never happen on two of that Nation together, that
would acknowledge that they could write their owne lan∣guage.


Sir 
Thomas Smith
 her Maiesties secretarie not long since,
a man of great learning and iudgement, occasioned by som
vncertainty of our Orthographie, though it seeme groun∣ded
vpon 
Sound, Reason,
 and 
Custome,
 laboured to reduce
it to certaine heads; Seeing that whereas of Necessity there
must be so many letters in every tongue, as there are sim∣ple
and single sounds, that the Latine letters were not suf∣ficient
to expresse all our simple sounds. Therefore he wi∣shed
that we should have A short, and A long, bicause 
a
 in

Man,
 and in 
Mân
 of horse hath different sounds; E long as
in 
Mên
 moderate, and 
e
 short as in 
Men,
 and an English 
e

as in 
wée, thee, he, me:
 I long, and I short, as in Bi, 
per,

and Bî, 
emere:
 O short, and O long, as in smōk of a wo∣man,
and smôk of the fire: V long, as in Bût, 
Ocrea,
 and
V short, as in Būt, 
Sed:
 and v or y 
Greeke,
 as slu, nu, tru.
For consonants he would have C be never vsed but for Ch,
as it was among the olde English, and K in all other words;
for Th, he would have the 
Saxon
 letter 
Thorne,
 which was
a D with a dash through the head, or 
; for I consonant the

Saxon
 
, as 
et,
 not Ieat for Ieat-stone, 
ay
 for Iay:

Q,
 if he were king of the A, B, C, should be putte to the
horne, and banished; and 
Ku
 in his place, as 
Kuik,
 not

quik, Kuarel,
 not 
Quarel: Z;
 he would have vsed for the
softer 
S,
 or eth, and es, as 
dîz
 for dieth, 
liz
 for lies, and
the same 
S
 inverted for 
sh,
 as 
Sal
 for 
shall, fler
 for 
flesh.

This briefly I have set you downe his devise, which albeit

Sound
 and 
Reason
 seemed to countenance, yet that Tyranne

Custome
 hath so confronted, that it will never be admit∣ted.


If it be any glorie which the 
French
 and 
Dutch
 do brag
of, that many wordes in their tongues doe not differ from
the 
Greeke,
 I can shew you as many in the 
English;
 where∣of
I will give you a few for a taste, as they have offred them∣selves


in reading; but withall, I trust you will not gather
by consequence, that wee are descanded from the 
Graeci∣ans.

Who dooth not see an identitie in these wordes, as if
the one descended from the other.

Heereby may be seene the originall of some english
words, and the 
Etymology
 or reason whence many other are
derived, beside them alreadie specified may as well be found
in our tongue, as in the learned tongues, although hardly;
for that heerein as in other tongues, the truth heth hidden
and is not easilie found, as both 
Varro
 and 
Isidor
 do acknow∣ledge.
But an indifferent man may iudge that our name of
the most divine power, God, is better derived from Good,
the chiefe attribute of God, than 
Deus
 from 
, because
God is to be feared. So 
Winter
 from Winde, 
So
er
 from
the Sonne, 
Lent
 from springing, because it falleth in the
spring, for which our Progenitours the 
Germans,
 vse 
Glent.

The feast of Christs Rising, 
Easter,
 from the old world 
East,

which we now vse for the place of the rising of the 
Sunne,
Sayle
 as the 
Sea-haile, Windor
 or 
Windowe,
 as a doore against
the winde, 
King
 from 
Conning,
 for so our Great grandfa∣thers
called them, which one word imployeth two most


important matters in a Governour, 
Power
 and 
Skill,
 and
many other better answering in sound and sence, then those
of the 
Latines, Frater quasi ferè alter, Tempestas quasi Tem∣pus
pestis, Caput à capiendo, Digiti quia decentèr iuncti, Cura
quia cor vrit, Peccare quasi pedam capere.


Dionysius
 a Greeke coyner of 
Etymologyes
 is commended
by 
Athenaeus,
 in his supper-gulls, table-talkers, or 
Deipnos
∣phistae,

for making mowse-traps of 
Musteria:
 and verily if
that be commendable, the Mint-masters of our 
Etymilogies,

deserve no lesse commendation: for they have merily for∣ged

Mony
 from 
My-hony, Flatter
 from flie-at-her, 
Shovell

from shove-full, 
Mayd
 as my ayd 
Mastiefe
 as Mase-thiefe,

Staffe as Stay of, Beere, Be-heere, Symony See-mony, Stirrup,
a Sayre-vp, &c.


This merry playing with words too much vsed by some
hath occasioned a great and high personage, to say, that as
the 
Italian
 tongue is fit for courting, the 
Spanish
 for treating,
the 
French
 for trafficke; so the 
English
 is most fit for trifling
and toying. And so doth 
Giraldus Cambrensis
 seem to think
whenas in his time he saith, the 
English
 and 
Welsh
 delighted
much in licking the letter and clapping together of Ag∣nominations.
But now will I conclude this trifling discourse
with a true tale out of an antient Historian.


Of the effectuall power of words, great disputes have
beene of great wits in all ages; the 
Pithagoreans
 extolled it,
the impious Iewes ascribed all miracles to a name which
was ingravened in the revestiarie of the Temple, watched
by two brazen dogges, which one stale away and enseamed
it in his thigh, as you may reade in 
Osorius de Sapientia,
 and
the like in 
Rabi Hamas Speculation:
 and strange it is what

Samonicus Serenus
 ascribed to the word ABRADACABRA, a∣gainst
agues. But there was one true English word of as
great, if not greater force than them all, now out of all vse
and will be thought for sound barbarous; but therefore of
more efficacie (as it pleaseth 
Porphyrie
) and in signification
it signifieth as it seemeth, no more then abiect, base minded,
false harted, coward, or nidget. Yet it hath levied Armies,


and subdued rebellious enemies; and that I may hold you
no longer, it is 
Niding.
 For when there was a daungerous
rebellion against King 
William Rufus,
 and 
Rochester
 Ca∣stle
then the most important & strongest fort of this Realm
was stowtly kept against him, after that he had but proclai∣med
that his subiects should repaire thither to his Campe,
vpon no other penaltie, but that whosoever refused to come,
should be reputed a 
Niding:
 they swarmed to him immedi∣atly
from all sides in such numbers, that he had in few daies
an infinite Armie, and the rebells therewith weere so terri∣fied,
that they forthwith yeelded. While I runne on in this
course of English tongue, rather respecting matter then
words, I forget that I may be charged by the mi
ion refi∣ners
of English, neither to write State-English, Court-En∣glish,
nor Secretarie-English, and verily I acknowledge it.
Sufficient it is for me, if I have waded hither-vnto in the
fourth kinde, which is plaine English, leaving to such as are
compleat in all, to supply whatsoever remaineth.






Christian Names.


N
Ames called in Latine 
Nomina quas

Notamina,
 were first imposed for the
distinction of persons, which wee call
now Christian names: After for diffe∣rence
of families which wee call Sur∣names,
and have beene especially re∣spected
as whereon the glorie and cre∣dite
of men is grounded, and by which


the same is convayed to the knowledge of posteritie.


Every person had in the beginning one onely proper
name, as among the Iewes, 
Adam, Ioseph, Solomon;
 among the
Aegiptians, 
Anubis, Amasis, Busuris;
 among the Chaldaeans,

Ninus,
 
Ninias, Semira
;
 among the Medians, 
Astiages, Bar∣danes,
Arbaces;
 among the Grecians, 
Diomedes, Vlisses, Ore∣stes;

among the Romans, 
Romulus, Remus, Faustulus;
 among
the old Gaules, 
Litavicus, Cavarilus, Divitiacus;
 among the
Germans, 
Ariovistus, Arminius, Nassua;
 among the Britans,

Cassibellin, Caratac, Calgac;
 among the antient English,

Hengest,
 
Aella, Kenrie,
 likewise among all other Nations, ex∣cept
the savages of Mount 
Atlas
 in 
Barbary,
 which were re∣ported
to be both namelesse and dreamelesse.


The most antient Nation of the Iewes gave the name
at the Circumcision the eight day after the nativitie; the
Romans to females the same day, to males the ninth day,
which they called 
Dies lustricus,
 as it were the cleansing day;
vpon which day they solemnized a feast called 
Nominalia,

and as 
Tertulian
 noteth, 
Fata scribenda advocabantur,
 that is,
as I conceive, their nativitie was set. At what time other
Nations in auntient times gave names I have not read:
but since Christianitie, most Nations for the time followed
the Iewes, celebrating baptisme the eight day after the birth,
onely our Ancestours in this Realme, vntill latter time bap∣tized,
and gave name the very birth day, or next day after,
following therein the counsell of S. 
Cyprian,
 in his third E∣pistle

Ad Fidum.
 But the Polonians gave name in the
seaventh yeare,
 at which time they did first cut their chil∣drens
haire.


The first imposition of Names was grounded vpon so
many occasions, as were hard to be specified, but the most
common in most antient times among all nations, as well as
the 
Hebrewes,
 was vpon future good hope conceived by
parents of their children, in which you might see their first
and principall wishes toward them. Whereupon Saint 
Hie∣rome

saith, 
Ʋotiva & quasi ob virtutis auspicium imponuntur
vocabula hominibus, & appellativa vertuntur inpropria, sicut a∣pud


Latines, Victor, Probus, Castus, &c.
 And such hopefull
luckie names called by 
Cicero,
 
Bona nomina,
 by 
Tacitus, Fan∣sta
nomina
 were ever first enrolled and 
anged in the 
Roman

Musters; first called out to serve at the first sacrifices, in the
foundation of 
Colonies,
 as 
Statorius, Faustus, Valerius,
 which
implied the persons to be stowt, happy, and valorous. As
contrariwise 
Atrius V
ber
 is accounted in 
I
vie, abominandi
ominis nomen,
 an abhominable name, for that it participa∣ted
in signification with dismall darkenes, dead ghosts, and
shadowes. And you remember what 
Plautus
 saieth of one
whose name was 
Lyco,
 that is, a 
Greedy Woolfe;


Vosmet nunc facit
 coniectur 
 caeterùm


Quid id sit hominis, cui Lyco nomen siet.


Yea such names were thought so happy and so fortu∣nate,
that in the time of 
Galienus
 one 
Regilianus,
 which com∣manded
in 
Illyricum,
 got the Empire there, only in favour of
of his name. For when it was demanded at a supper from
whence 
Regilianus
 was derived, one answered, 
à Regno,
 an∣other
beganne to decline 
Rex, Regis, Regi, Regilianus;
 where∣at
the souldiers (which in all actions are forward.) beganne
with acclamation, 
Ergo potest Rex esse, Ergo potest regere,
Deus tibi regis nomen imposuit:
 and so invested him with im∣periall
roabes. In this Isle also at 
Silcaster
 in Hamshire, 
Con∣stantinus

a militarie man of some reputation, in hope of his
luckie name, and that he would proue another 
Constantinus
Magnus
 to the good of the people, was by the Britan Ar∣mie
proclaimed emperour against 
Henorius:
 who exploy∣ted
great matters in his owne person in 
Gallia,
 and by his
son in 
Spaine.
 So in former times the name of 
Antoninus
 in
remembrance of 
Antoninus Pius,
 was so amiable among the
Romans, as he was supposed vnfit for the empire, who
bare not that name, vntill 
Antoninus Elagabalus
 with his fil∣thie
vices distained the same. We reade also that two Am∣bassadours
were sent out of 
France
 into 
Spaine,
 to King 
Al∣phonse

the 9, to d
mand one of the daughters that he begat
of the daughter of King 
Henry
 the second of 
England,
 to be
married to their Soveraigne, King 
Lewes
 the eight: one of


these Ladies was very beautifull called 
Vrraca,
 the other
not so beautifull, but named 
Blanche.
 When they were pre∣sented
to the Ambassadours, all men held it as a matter re∣solved
that the choyce would light vpon 
Vrraca,
 as the elder
and fairer: But the Ambassadours enquiring each of their
names, tooke offence at 
Ʋrraca,
 and made choyce of the
Lady 
Blanche,
 saying, That her name would be better re∣ceived
in 
France
 than the other, as signifying faire and beau∣tifull,
according to the verse made to her honour.


Candida, candescens candore, & cordis, & oris.


So that the greatest Philosopher 
Plato
 might seeme, not
without cause, to advise men to be carefull in giving faire
and happie names: as the 
Pythagoreans
 affirmed the mindes,
actions, and successes of men to be according to their 
Fate,
Genius,
 and 
Name.
 One also well observeth that these seven
things; Virtue, good Parentage, Wealth, Dignity or Office,
good Presence, a good Christian name, with a gratious Sur∣name,
and seemely attire, doe especially grace and adorne a
man. And accordingly saieth 
Panormitan; Ex bono nomine
oritur bona presumptio.
 As the common Proverb, 
Bonum
nomen, bonum omen.


The divell neverthelesse who alwayes maligneth God
and goodnesse,
 wrought by the cruelty of 
Valens
 the em∣perour
the destruction of many men of worth, who hadde
happy names beginning with 
Theo
 signifying God, as 
The∣odorus,
Theodubis, Theodoretus, Theodosius,
 &c. For that di∣verse
curious companions had found by the falling of a ring
magically prepared, vpon those letters onely of all the 
Al∣phab
t,

graven in a Charger of sundry mettals, and set vpon
a Laurell trivet; that one who had his name beginning with

Theod,
 should succeede in the empire, which was verified
in 
Theodosius
 not long after.


In times of Christianity the names of most holy and ver∣tuous
persons, and of their most worthy progenitors were
given to stir vp men to the imitation of them, whose names
they bare. But succeeding ages (little regarding saint 
Chry∣sostoms

admonition to the contrary, have recalled prophane


names, so as now 
,

names of vnhappy disastre are as 
 some 

they were in 
Paga
sm
s▪
 Albeit in our late 

of good consideration have brought in 


Iosias, &c.
 as better agreeing with our saith, but without
contempt of our countrey names (as I hope) which have
both good and gratious significations, as shal appeare here∣after.


Whereas in late yeeres Surnames have beene given for
Christian names, among vs, and no where else in Christen∣dome;
although many dislike it, for that great inconveni∣ence
will ensue: neverthelesse it seemeth to proceede from
hearty good-will and affection of the Godfathers to show
their love, or from a desire to continue and propagate their
owne names to succeeding ages. And is in no wise to be dis∣liked,
but rather approoved in those which matching with
heires generall of worshipful antient families have given
those names to their heires, with a mindefull and thankefull
regard of them, as we have now, 
Pickering Wott
n, Grevill
Varney, Bassingburne Ga
dy, Culthorp Parker, Pees
ll Brac
,
Fuz-Raulfe Chamberlaine,
 who are the hei
s of 
Pickering,

 Bassingburn, Grevill, Calthorp, &c.
 For beside the con∣tinuation
of the name, we see that the selfe name, yea & som∣time
the similitude of names doth kindle sparkles of love
and liking among meere strangers.


Neither can I beleeve a waiward olde man, which would
say, that the giving of Surnames for Christian names first
began in the time of king 
Edward
 the sixt, by such as would
be Godfathers, when they were more then halfe fathers,
and thereupon would have perswaded some to change such
names at the Confirmation. Which (that I may note by
the way) is vsuall in other countries, as wee remember two
sonnes of king 
Henry
 the second of 
France,
 christ
ed by the
names of 
Alexander
 and 
Hercules,
 ch
ged them at their
Confirmation into 
 and 
Francis.


But two Christian names are rare in 
England,
 and I only
remember now his Maiesty who was named 
Charles Iames,



as the Prince 
 and among private
men, 
Thomas Maria Wingfield,
 and sir 
Thomas P
sth
us
Hobby.
 Although it is common in 
Ita
e,
 to adioyne the
name of some Saint, in a kinde of devotion to the Christi∣an
name, as 
 Baptista Spinalu, Iohannes Franciscns
Bor
omeus, Marcus Antonius 
:
 and in 
Spaine
 to
adde the name of the Saint on whose day the childe was
borne.


If that any among vs have named their children 
Remedi∣an

, Imago s
eu
,
 or with such like names, I knowe
some will thinke it more then a vanitie, as they do but lit∣tle
better of the new names, 
Free-gift, Reformation, Earth,
Dust, Ashes, Delivery, More fruite, Tribulation, The Lord is
neare, More triall, Discipline, Ioy againe, From above:
 which
have lately beene given by some to their children with no
evill meaning, but vpon some singular and precise conceit.
That I may omit another more vaine absurditie, in giving
names and surnames of ruen,
 yea and of the best families
to dogges, beares, and horses. Whenas wee reade it was
thought a capitall crime in 
Pomposiamas
 for calling his base
bondslaves by the name of grand captaines. Here I might
remember how some mislike the giving of parents names
successively to their heires,
 for that if they should be forced
to proove descent, it will be hard to proove the 
Doner
 and
the 
Done
 in 
Formedon,
 and to distinguish the one from the
other.


It were impertinent to note heere, that destinies were
superstitiously by 
Onomantin
 desciphered out of names, as
though the names and natures of men were sutable, and fa∣tall
necessitie concurred heerein with voluntary motion, in
giving the name, according to that of 
Ausonius
 to 
Probus.


Qualem cravit moribus,


Iussit vocari nomine.


Mundi supremus arbitar.


And after, where he playeth with bibbing mother 
Me∣re
,

as thogh she were so named, bicause she would to drink


meere wine without water, or as he pleasantly 
 it 
∣rum
Merum;
 for as he saieth;

Qui primus Mere
 
 tibi 


Thesida nomen condidit Hippolit
.


Nam divinare est, nomen componere, quòd 


Fortuna, morum, vel nocis indici
.


For 
Hyppolitus
 the sonne of 
Theseus
 was torne in 

by his coach horses, according to his name. So 
,

signified he should linger long before 
Trey. 
 that
he should be redeemed out of bondage in his childehoode,

Tantalus,
 that he should be most wretched, because 

in the one, and 
, in the other, and 

in the third implieth such accidents vnto them. Hither al∣so
may be referred that of 
Claudius Rutilius.


Nominibus certis credam decurrere mores?


Moribus aut potiùs nomina certa dari


But to confront Poet with Poet, our good 
Epigr 

Poet, olde 
Godfrey
 of 
Winchester
 thinketh no ominous
forspeaking to lie in names, in that to 
Faustus:


Multùm Fauste tua de nobilitate superbis,


Quodq, bone Faustus omine nomen habes,


Sed nullum nomen nomenti, sit licèt omen.


Memorable is that which may be observed out of hi∣stories,
how that men of the selfe same name have begun
and ended great states and empires: as 
Cyrus
 the sonne of

Cambises
 beganne the Persian Monarchy, 
Cyrus
 
he sonne
of 
Darius
 ruinated the same. 
Darius
 the sonne of 
Histaspes

restored it. And againe, 
Darius
 the sonne of 
Ars
is
 vt∣terly
overthrew it. 
Philip
 the sonne of 
Ami
tas
 especially
enlarged the kingdome of 
Macedonia, Philip
 the sonne of

Antigonus
 wholy lost the same. 
Augustus
 was the first e∣stablished
emperour of 
Rome, Augustulus
 the last. 
Constan∣tinus
Magnus
 borne in this Isle first beganne the Empire of

Constantinople, Constantinus
 the last left it to the Turkes, and
vtterly lost the same, &c.



Such 
 curions observations bred the superstitious
kinde of Divination called 
,
 condemned by the
last generall Counsell,
 by which the 
Pithagoreans
 iudged
the even number of vowells in names to signifie imperfe∣ctions
in the left sides of men, and the odde number in the
right. By this 
Augustus
 the emperour encouraged himselfe,
and conceived good hope of victory,
 whenas the night be∣fore
the sea-battell at 
Actium,
 the first man hee mette was a
poore waysa
ing man driving his asse before him, whose
name when hee demaunded, he answered, 
Eutyches,
 that
is, 
Happyman;
 and that his asses name was 
Nicon,
 that is,

Victor.
 In which place when he accordingly had obtained
the victory, he builded the Cittie 
Nicopolis,
 that is, 
the citty
of Victory,
 and there erected brasen Images of the man and
his asse.
 By this 
Theodatus
 king of the 
Gothes,
 when he was
curious to knowe the successe of his warres against the 
Ro∣mans,

an 
On
manticall
 or 
Name-wisard
 Iew willed him to
shut vp a number of swine in little hog-sties, and to give
some of them Roman names, to other Gotish names, with
severall markes, and there to leave them to a certaine day;
At the day appointed, the king with the Iew repaired to
the hog-sties, where they found them only dead to whom
they had given the Gotish names, and those alive to whom
they had given the Roman names, but yet with their bris∣sels
more then halfe shed. Whereupon the Iew foretolde,
that the 
Gothes
 should wholy be discomfited, and the 
Ro∣mans

should loose a great part of their forces.
 By this 
Vespa∣sian

was incouraged to take vpon him the empire, when
comming to the Temple of 
Serapi
 at 
Alexandria,
 and be∣ing
there alone at his devotion, he sodainly sawe in a vision,
one 
Basilides,
 a noble man of 
Aegypt,
 who was then foure
score miles off. Vpon which name of 
Basilides
 derived from

Basileus,
 signifying a King, hee assured himselfe of royaltie,
and the empire which hee then complotted for. As con∣cerning
this 
On
mantia
 a German lately set foorth a Table,
which I wish had beene suppressed, for that the divell by
such vanities, doth abuse the credulitie of youth to greater


matters, and sometimes to their 
.


I can not tell how you would like it if I should 
 re∣member
how the 
Greekes
 superstitiously iudged them more
happy, in whose names the numerall letters added toge∣ther
made the greater summe, and therefore 
Achilles
 for∣sooth
must needes vanquish 
Hector,
 because the numerall
Greeke letters rose to a greater number in his name then in
the others. Or how the amorous 
Romans
 kissed the Cup
with a health so often at their meetings, as there were let∣ters
in their Mistresse names, according to that of merry

Martiall
 of his two wenches, 
Navia
 which had six letters,
and 
Iustina
 that had seaven in her name;

Navia sex cyathis, septem Iustina 
ibatur.


Our Nation was farre from those and such curious 

therefore heere will I overpasse them, and set downe 
Alph
∣betically

the names which wee now call Christian names,
most vsuall to the English Nation, with their significations.
For this is to be takē as a granted veritie, that names among
all nations and tongues (as I partly noted before) as signi∣ficative
and not vaine senselesse sounds. Among the 
Ho∣brew
s

it is certaine out of sacred Scriptures, S. 
Hicrome,
 and

Philo
 likewise among the 
Greekes, Romans, German, French,

&c. yea among the barbarous Turks, for with them 
M
e∣met

signifieth glorified or laudable,
 
H
mar
 lively, 
Abdall

Gods servant, 
Seliman
 peaceable, 
Agm
 good, 
Ha
iza
 rea∣die.

Neam
 pl
asant.
 And the savages of 
Hispa
la
 and all

America,
 name their children in their owne languages, 
Gli∣stering
light, Sunne bright, Gold-bright, Fine gold, Sweete, Rich
feather, &c.
 as they of 
Congo,
 by names of birdes, pretious
stones floures, &c.


So that it were grosse ignorance and to no 
mall reproach,
of our Progenitours, to thinke their names onely nothing
significative, because that in the daily alteration of our 
ong,
the signification of them is lost, or not commonly knowne,
which yet I hope to recover, and to make in some part
knowne, albeit they cannot easily and happily be 
,


because as 
 noteth; Barberous name
 (as hee
terme th
 them,)
 were very emphaticall and very short. But
in all the significations of these names, you shall see the good
and hopefull respects which the devisers of the names had,
that there is an 
Orthetes
 or certitude of names among all
Nations according to 
Plate,
 and thereby perceive that many
were translated out of the Greeke and Latine. With all we
may make this fruit by consideration of our names, which
have good, hopefull, and luckie significations, that accor∣dingly
we do carrie and conforme our selves; so that wee
faile not to be answerable to them, but be 
Nostri nominis
homines,
 and 
, as 
Severus, Preb
s,
 and 
Aur
lus
 are
called 
Sui nominis imporatores.
 And accordingly it seemeth
to have beene the manner at giving of names, to wish the
children might performe and discharge their names, as
when 
Gunthr
 King of the French, named 
Clatharius
 at
the font, he said; 
Crescat puer, & huius sit nominis executer.


But before I proceed farther, this is to be noted. In most
antient times the Britans had heere their peculiar names,
for the most part taken from colours, (for they vsed to pain

themselves) which are now lost or remaine among the
Welsh. Afterward they tooke Roman names when they
were Provincialls, which either remaine corrupted among
them, or were extinguished in the greatest part of the
Realme, after the entrance of the English 
Saxons,
 who
brought in their German names, as 
Cridda, Ponda, Oswald,
Edward, Vchtred, Edmund,
 &c. Then to say nothing of the
Danes, who no doubt brought in their names, as 
Suayn, Ha∣rold,
Knute,
 &c. The Normans conquest brought in other
German names, for they originally vsed the German tong,
as 
William, Henry, Richard, Robert, Hughe, Roger,
 &c. as the
Greeke names,
 
A
labius, i.
 Innocent, 
Aspasious i.
 Delightful,

Beëthius, Symmachus. i.
 Helper, 
Texetius. i.
 Archer, &c. were
brought into 
Italy
 after the division of the Empire. After
the Conquest, our Nation (who before would not admitte
st
nge and vnknowne names, but avoyded them therefore
as vnluckie) by little and little beganne to vse Hebrew and


sacred names, as 
Mathew, David, Sampson, Luke, 
,
 &c.
which were never received in Germany,
 
 the 

of 
Frederick
 the second, about some 300. yeares since.


So that the 
Saxons, Danish, Norman,
 and 
British
 tongues.
are the fittest keyes to open the entrance for searching out
of our antient names yet in vse. For the Hebrew I wil follow
the common tables of the Bible, which every one may do
as well, and 
Philo Do nominibus mutatis.
 For the Greeke the
best Glossaries with mine owne little skill. For the Welsh,
I will sparingly touch them, or leave them to the learned of
that Nation. But for old English names, which heere are the
scope of my care, I must sift them as I may out of old En∣glish-
Saxon

treatises, as I have happened vpon heere and
there: and some coniecturally, referring all to the iudgement
of such, as shall be more happy in finding out the truth, ho∣ping
that probability may either please, or be pardoned by
such as are modestly learned in histories and languages; to
whose iudgement in all humilitie, I commit all that is to be
said. For that they cānot but observe the diversity of names,
from the originall in divers languages, as how the French
have changed 
Petrus
 into 
Pierre, Iohaunes
 to 
, Benedi∣ctus

to 
Beneist, Stephanus
 to 
Esti
n, Radulphus
 to 
R
l:
 how
the Italians have changed 
Iohannes
 into 
Giovanni, Constans

into 
Gostante, Christopherus
 into 
Christophan
, Iacobus
 into

Iacope, Radulphus
 into 
Ridulpho, Laurentius
 into 
Lorenz.

How the Welsh have altered 
Ioannes
 into 
Even, Aegidius

into 
Silim, George
 into 
Sior, Lawrence
 into 
Lowris, Constan∣tinus

into 
Custenith.
 How the English have changed 
Gerrard

into 
Garret, Albric
 into 
Aubry, Alexander
 into 
Sanders, Con∣stantin

into 
Custance, Benedict
 into 
Bennet.
 How the 
En∣glish

and 
Scottish
 borderers do vse 
Roby
 and 
Rob
 for 
Robert,
L
kky
 for 
Luke, Io
ie
 and 
Ionie
 for 
Iohn, Cristie
 for 
Christopher,

&c. That I may omit the Spaniard which have turned 
Iohn

into 
Iuan,
 and 
Iacobus
 into 
Iago
 and 
Diego:
 as the Ger∣mans
which have contracted 
Iohannes
 into 
House,
 and 
The∣odoric

into 
Doric.
 These and the like, whosoever will lear∣nedly
consider, will not thinke any thing strange which shal


hereafter follows; howsoever the vnlearned will boldly cen∣sure
it. I had purposed heere, lest I might seeme heereafter
to lay my foundations in the sands of coniecture, and not
on grounds of truth and authoritie, to have given you the
signification of such words as offer themselves most fre∣quent
in the compositions of our meers English names,

viz.

And these not out of suppositive coniectures, but out of

Alfricus Grammer,
 who was a learned Archbishop of 
Can∣terbury,

well neere six hundred yeare since, and therefore
not to be supposed ignorant of the English tongue, out of
the 
English-Saxon Testament, Psalter,
 and 
Lawes,
 out of 
Wil∣leramus
Paraphrasis
 vpon the 
Canticles,
 and the learned
Notes thereon by a man skilfull in the Northerne tongues,
as also out of 
Beatus Rhonanus,
 M. 
Luther, Dasipodius, Kil∣lianus,

who have laboured in illustration of the old 
German

tongue, which vndoubtedly is the matrix and mother of
our English. But I thinke it most fitting to this purpose, to
shew those my grounds in their proper places heereafter.

Heb.
 Iust.


ADAM, 
Heb.
 Man,

ADOLPH, s

Eadulph.


ADRIAN, 
 
Hadrian.


ALAN, is thought by 
Iuhas Scaliger
 (some of
whose progenitors bare that name) to sig∣nifie
an hownd in the 
Sclavonian
 tongue,
and 
Chancer
 vseth 
 in the same sense:
neither may it seem strange to take names
from beasts. The 
Romanes
 had their 
Ca∣ninius,
Apur, Asinus, &c.
 and 
,

Lup
 Ʋrsula.
 But whereas 

into 
England
 with 
Alan
 earle of 
Britaine,
 to
whome the Conqueror gave the greatest
part of 
,
 and hath 
 most
common since that time in the Northern
parts, in the yonger children of the noble
house of 
Percies,
 and the family of 
Zouch,

descended from the Earles of 
Britaine;
 I
would feeles it rather out of the 
British,

than 
 tongue, and will beleeve
with an 

from 
Aeliamus,
 that is, Sunne-bright, as
they 
 into 
Guida
.



and hope 
,


wealth and might, as 
Plutarchus, Ar∣chitas,
Crates, Craterus, Polycrates, Pancratius,

with the 
Greekes, Regulus Opimius, &c.
 with
the 
Latines.
 The king of the 
Gothes,
 which
sacked 
Rome
 bearing his name, was called by
the 
Romans Allaricus,
 the olde Englishmen
turned it into 
Alric,
 the 
Normans
 into 
Aiberic.

That 
Ric,
 as it signified a kingdome, so also it
signified, rich, wealthy, mighty, able power∣ful,
attributes to a kingdome; the word yet re∣maines
in that sence among all the 
German

nations dispersed in 
Europe,
 and little mollisi∣ed
dooth sufficiently proove. The 
Italians
 re∣ceiving
it from the 
Longobardes,
 have turned it
into 
Ricco,
 the 
Spaniards
 from the 
Gothes
 in∣to

Rico,
 the 
French
 from the 
Frankes
 into

Richo,
 we from the 
Saxons
 into 
Rich, &c. For∣tunatus
Venantius,
 who lived about a thousand
yeares since, translated it by 
Potens,
 and 
Fortis

in these verses to 
Hilperic
 king of 
Fraunce:


Hilperice potens, si interpres barbarus adsit,


Adiutor fortis hoc quoq, nomen habet.


Nec fuit in vanum sic te vocitare parentes,


Praesagum hoc totum laudis, & omen erat.


As that 
Hilperic
 did signifie, puissant and
mightie helper. This name is vsually written

Chilperic,
 but the 
C
 was set before the 
Coning,

that is, 
King,
 as in 
Clotharius, Clodovens, Cheri∣bertus,

for 
Lotharius, Lodovaeus, Heribertus. Au∣bry

hath beene a most common name in the
honorable familie of 
Vere
 earles of 
Oxford.


ALBAN, 
Lat. White,
 or 
High,
 as it pleaseth other.
The name of our 
Stephen
 and first Martyr of

Britaine.


ALVVIN, 
Sax. All victorious,
 or 
Winning all,



as 
Victor
 and 
Vincontius,
 in Latine 
Nicetas
 and

Nicophorus.
 The Yorkeshireman, which was
Schoolemaister to 
Carolus Magnus,
 and per∣swaded
him to found the Vniversitie of 
Pa∣ris,

is in an English-Saxon treatise called 
Al∣win.

But the 
French,
 as it seemeth, not able to
pronounce the 
w,
 called him 
Alcumus,
 and

Albinus.


ALBERT, 
Germ. All-bright,
 as 
Epiphanius, Phae∣drus,
Eudoxus
 with the 
racians: Lucilius, Illu∣strius,
Fulgentius,
 with the 
Latines, Beert
 and

Bert,
 as 
Alfricus,
 and 
Rhenamus
 do translate it,
is 
famous, faire,
 and 
cleare.
 Which the rather I
beleeve, for that 
Bertha
 a German Lady sent
into 
Greece,
 was there called 
Eudoxia
 in the
same sence, as 
Luitprandus
 reporteth. They
moreover that in auntient Bookes are written

Ecbert, Sebert, Ethelbert,
 in the latter are writ∣ten

Echright, Sebright, Ethelbright:
 So that,

Bert
 in composition of names dooth not sig∣nifie

Beard,
 as some translate it.


AELFRED,
 
Sax. All peace,
 not varying much in
signification from 
Irenans. Eal, Ail, Ael
 in
old English compound names is answerable
to 
Pan
 and 
Pam
 in Greek names, as 
Pamphilus,
Pammachius, Panaetius, Pantalcon, &c.


ALDRED, 
Sax.
 All reverent feare.


ALEXANDER, 
Gre.
 Succour-man, or Helper of
men.


ALPHONS, if it be a German name, and came in∣to

Spaine
 with the 
Gothes,
 a German nation, it
is as much as 
Holfa
s,
 that is, 
Our helpe,
 and
probable it is to be a 
Gotish
 name, for 
Alphens

the first king of 
Spaine
 of that name 
Anno
 740
was descended from the 
Gothes.


AMERY, in 
Latine Almaricus,
 from the German

Emerich,
 that is, alwayes rich, able, and pow∣erfull,


according to 
Luther:
 the 
French
 write
it 
Aumery,
 as they of 
Theoderic, Henric, Frede∣ric,

make 
Terrey, Henry, Frery.


AMBROSE,
 gr
 Divine, Immortall.


AMIE, from the French 
Amiè,
 that is, 
Beloved,

and that from 
Amatus,
 as 
Renè
 from 
Renatus.

The erles and dukes of 
Savoy
 which be com∣monly
called 
Aimè,
 were in Latine called 
A∣madeus,

that is, 
Loving God,
 as 
Theophilus,
 and
so was that erle of 
Savoy
 called, which did ho∣mage
to king 
Henry
 the third of 
England
 for

Bourg
 in 
Bresse,
 Saint 
Maurice
 in 
Chablais,
Chasteau Bard, &c.
 which I note for the ho∣nour
of 
England.
 We doe vse now 
Amias
 for
this in difference from 
Amie
 the womens
name. Some deduce 
Amias
 from 
Aemilius

the 
Roman
 name, which was deduced from
the Greeke 
Aimulios, Faire spoken.


ANANIAS,
 heb. The grace of the Lord.


ANDREVV, 
gre: Manly,
 or 
Manfull Freculphus

turneth it 
Decorus, Comely
 and 
Decent;
 I know
not vpon what ground. See 
Charles.


ANARAVD, 
brit.
 corrupted from 
Honoratus,
 that
is, Honorable.


ANGEL, 
gre:
 a Messenger.


ANTHONIE, 
gre:
 as 
Anthoros,
 flourishing, from
the greeke 
Anthos
 a floure, as 
Florens
 and 
Flo∣rentius

with the Latines, and 
Thales, Euthalius

with the Greekes. There are yet some that
drawe it from 
Anton
 a companion of 
Hercu∣les,


ANSELM, 
germ:
 Defence of Authoritie, accord∣ing
to 
Luther.
 Whether this name came from
the Gotish word 
Anses,
 by which the 
Gothes

called their victorious Capitaines as Demi∣gods,
I dare not determine: yet 
Ansbert, An∣segis,
Answ
ld,
 Germane names, and 
Anske∣tel



vsed much in the antient house of the 
Mal∣lories

seeme to descend from one head.


ARCHEBALD,
 vide Erchenbald.


ARFAST, 
Sax.
 Goodly-man [
Alfricus.
]


ARNOLD, 
ger:
 Honest, but the Germans write

Ernold. Probus
 in Latine [
Luther.
] It hath
beene common in the old familie of the 
Boy∣ses.


ARTHVR, a Latin name in 
Iuvenal
 drawne from
the goodly fixed starre 
Arcturus,
 and that
from 
Arctus
 is the Beare, as 
Vrsicinus
 amongst
the Romanes. The famous 
Arthur
 made
this name first famous amongest the 
Brit∣taines.


AVGVSTINE,
 Latine, 
ncreasing, 
or
 Maiesticall

from
 Augustus, 
as
 Victorinus, Iustinus, Constan∣tinus

diminutives from
 Victor, Iustus, Constans,

according to
 Molinaeus. 
One observeth that
adoptive names doe end in
 anus, 
as
 Aemilia∣nus,
Domitianus, Iustinianus, 
adopted by
 Ae∣milius,
Domitius, Iustinus [Lilius Giraldus.]






B


BALDVVIN, 
Ger.
 if we beleeve 
Luther, Spee∣die
Conquerour,
 if 
Rhenanus,
 and 
Lipsius, Victo∣rious
power.
 But whereas 
Iornandes,
 cap. 29.
sheweth that king 
Alaric
 was surnamed 
Baldh
id est,
 
Audax:
 for that he was bold and ad∣venturous,
and both 
Kilianus,
 and 
Lipsius
 him
selfe doth confesse,
 that it was antiently in
vse, for Bold and confident, 
Baldwin
 must sig∣nifie
Bold victor, as 
Winbald,
 the same name


inverted, 
Ethelbald
 nobly bold, 
Willibald
 very
bold and confident, concurring somewhat
in signification with 
Thraseas, Thrasimachus,
Thrasibulus,
 
Thrasillus
 of the Graecians. So all
the names wherein 
Win
 is found, seeme to im∣ply
victorie, as 
Tatewin,
 Learned victor, 
Bert∣win,

Famous victor, 
Earlewin,
 Glorions or ho∣nourable
victor, and 
Ʋnwin,
 yet amongst the
Danes for invincible [
Ionas Turson
] as 
Ani∣cetus

in Greeke. Accordingly we may iudge
that most names wherein 
Win
 is found, to re∣semble
the Greeke names, 
Nicetes, Nicocles,
Nichomachus, Nicander, Polynices,
 &c. which
have 
Nice
 in them.


BAPTIST, 
gre:
 A name given to S. 
Iohn,
 for that
he first baptized, and to many since in honor
of him.


BARDVLPH,
 
Ger.
 from 
Bertulph .i. faire helpe,
Viph,
 
Wolf, Hulf, Aelf, Hilp, Helf,
 signifie 
Help,

as 
Luther
 and others assure vs. So 
Aelfwin
-Victorious
helpe, 
Aeelfric
 Rich or powerfull
helpe, 
Aelfwold
 Helping Governour, 
Aelf∣giva

Helpe-giver. Names conformable to 
Bo∣etius,
Symmachus,
 &c.


BARTHOLMEVV, 
Hebr.

which lifteth vp the minde of his teachers,

BASIL, 
Gre.
 Royall, Kingly, or Princely.


BEDE, 
Sax.
 He that praieth, or a devout man,
as 
Eucherius,
 or 
Eusebius
 in Greeke. We re∣taine
still 
Bedman
 in the same sence, and to

say our bedes,
 is but to say our praiers.


BEAVIS, may seeme probably to be corrupted


from the name of the famous 
Celtique
 King

Bellovesus.
 Wher
as the French have made in
like sort 
Beavois
 of the olde Cittie 
Bellova∣cum.

In both these is a significancie of beau∣tie.
In latter times 
Boge
 hath beene vsed in
Latine for 
Beavis.


BENET, 
Lat.
 contracted from 
Benedictus. i.
 Bles∣sed.


BENIAMIN,

BERNARD, 
Germ.
 Saint 
Bernardes Cluniac

Monks drew it from 
Bona Nardus,
 by allusi∣on,
some turne it Hard child, in which sence

Barne
 is yet retained with vs in the North. If
it be derived as the Germans wil have it from

Bearne,
 which signifieth a 
Beare,
 it is answe∣rable
to 
Arthur.
 Others yet more iudicially
translate 
Bernard,
 into 
Filialis indoles, Childe∣like
disposition
 toward parents, as 
Bernher, Lord
of many children.
 It hath been most common
in the house of 
Brus
 of 
Connigton
 and 
Exton.

Out of the which the Lord 
Harrington
 of

Exton,
 and Sir 
Robert Cotton
 of 
Connington
 are
discended, as his most excellent Maiestie
from 
Robert Brus,
 eldest brother to the first

Bernard


BERTRAN, for 
Bertrand,
 Faire and pure; some
thinke that the Spaniards have with sweeter
sound drawne hence their 
Fernando
 and 
Fer∣dinando.


BLASH, 
Gr. Budding forth,

BONIFACE,

CALISTHENES, 
Gre.
 Beautifull & strong.


CARADOC, 
Bri.
 Deerely beloved. 
Quaere.


CEASAR, This came a late to be a Christian
name among vs. 
Spartianus
 saith it was first
given for killing of an Elephant, which in the
Moores language is called 
Caesar,
 or that he
was cut out of his mothers woombe, or borne
with a bush of haire, or grey eyes. Such va∣riety
of opinions is concerning a name, which
as he saith, 
Cum 
ternitate mundi duratur
.


CHARLES, 
Germ.
 according to 
I. Du Tillet,

from 
Carl,
 that is, strong, stowt, couragious,
and valiant, as 
Virius, Valerius, Ʋaleus, &c.
 with
the Romans, 
Craterus, &c.
 with the Greekes;
not from the Greeke 
Charilans,
 which signifi∣eth

Publicola,
 the Claw-backe of the people.
The 
Hungarians
 call a king by a generall name

Carl [Aventinus.
]. And 
Carl
 is onely in the
coines of 
Carolus Magnus,
 Ful. Scaliger makes

Caellman Carlman
 answerable to the Greeke

Andreas.



CHRISTOPHER, 
Gre. Christe-carrier,
 a name, as
learned men thinke, devised, and a picture
thereunto mystically applied as a representati∣on
of the dueties of a true Christian,
 and was
as their 
Nosce teipsum.
 Of such mystical Sym∣boles
of the Primitive Christians; See 
Ioseph
Scaliger ad Freherum.


CHRYSOSTOME,

CLEMENS,
 lat: Meeke, Milde

CONSTANTIN, 
Lat: Fast,

Firme,
 for which

Custance.


CONRAD, 
germ: Able-counsell,
 or 
Advised va∣lour,

as 
Iulius Scaliger
 will 
Exercitat.
 256.
But heere is to be noted, that 
Rad, Red,
 and

Rod
 signifie 
counsell
 and 
advise. [Luther, Al∣fricus,
Killian
] and differ onely in Dialect, as

Stan, Sten, Stone.
 And this appeereth by that
which the Northerne men cried when they
killed 
Walter
 bishop of 
Duresme, Short Rad,
good Rade, quell yee the Bishop,
 that is, 
Short
councell, Good councell, &c. [M. Paris.
]


CORNELIVS, 
Lat:
 All drawe it from 
Cornis
 an
horne.


CVTHBERT, 
Sax.
 Not 
Cut-beard,
 as some fable,
but famous, bright, and cleare skill or know∣ledge,
according to the olde verse;

Qui{que} gerit certum Cuthbert de luce vocamen.

No man doubteth but 
Cuth
 signified know∣ledge,
as 
vncuth
 vnknowne; So 
Cuthwin
 skil∣full
victor, 
Cuthred,
 skilfull in counsell.


CYPRIAN, 
gre:
 from 
Cypria,
 a name of 
Venus,
 so
named of the Isle of 
Cyprus,
 where she was e∣specially
honoured.


CADVVALLADER, 
Brit:
 A warrelike name, de∣duced
from 
Cad,
 that is, 
Battaile,
 as it seemeth:
but I referre it to the learned 
Britans.


CRESCENS,
 Lat: Increasing.








D


DANIEL,
 Hebr. Iudgement of God.


DAVID,
 Hebr. Beloved.


DEMETRIVS, 
Ger.
 belonging to 
Ceres.


DENIS, 
Gr.
 for 
Dronisius,
 which some fetch from

Dios nous, s. divine mind.
 It is one of the names
of the drunkard 
Bacehus,
 & derived by 
Non∣nus

in his 
Dionysiacis,
 from 
Iupiter
 his lame leg,
for 
Nises
 signifieth, saith he, 
lame
 in the 
Syrian

tongue: and we will imagine that 
Iupiter
 hal¦ted
when 
Bacehus
 was enseamed in his thigh
But Saint 
Denis
 of 
Fraunce
 hath most graced
this name.


DRV, in 
Lat Drugo,
 or 
Dr
g
 Subtile, as 
Callidius

in 
Latin
 if it come from the 
Saxon
 or 
German;

but if it bee French, 
Lively
 and 
Lustie [Ni
cetius
]


DVNSTAN, 
Sax.
 One that writeth S. 
Dunstans

life, saith the name is answerable to 
Aaron
s.

Mountaine of fortitude. That 
Dun
 with the
old English signified a mountain or high hill,
is apparant that they called mountaine man

Dunlettan,
 and 
Downe
 continueth in the like
sence with vs.
 Others suppose it to signifie

Most high,
 as among our Ancestors 
Leofstan

signified 
Most beleved, Betstan, Best of al, Frid∣stan,

most peacefull, &c. 
Stan
 being the most
vsuall termination of the Superlative degree.








E


EADGAR,
 
Sax
 for 
Eadig
ar, Happy,
 or 
blessed
honor,
 or 
power,
 for I find it interpreted in
an old history 
Faelix potestas
 The last verse of

Ethelwardus
 historie seemeth to proove the
same, and 
Eadigi
 (for the which 
Ead
 was vsed
in composition,) is the word in the c. of saint

Math.
 in the English 
Saxon
 testament, so of∣tē

terated, for 
Blessed
 in the Beatitudes. That

Ear,
 or 
Ar,
 signifie 
Honor,
 it appeareth in the

Saxon
 lawes,
 and in 
Ionas Turson Danish Vo∣cabulary,

as 
Artic
 & 
Earlic,
 Honourable. And
from honor commeth our honourable name
of Earles, which came hither with the 
Danes,

as may be gathered out of 
Ethetwerdus.


EDMVND, 
Sax.
 for 
Eadmund,
 Happy, or blessed,
peace: Our Lawyers yet doe acknowledge

Muna
 for 
Peace.

ETHELBERT, or 
Edlebert,
 Noble bright, or no∣bly
renowmed,
 for 
Ethel
 or 
Adel,
 signifie in

Germany,
 Noble. From whence happily 
Athal∣ric

King of the 
Gothes
 had his name. From
hence it was that the heires apparant of the
Crowne of 
England,
 were surnamed 
Etheling .i.

Noble borne, and 
Clito .i. Inclitus;
 as in the de∣clining
estate of the 
Roman
 Empire, the heires
of Emperours were called 
Nobilisssimi:
 hence
also the Spaniards which discended from the
German 
Gothes,
 may seeme to have partly
borrowed their 
Idal-guie,
 by which word they
signifie their noblest gentlemen.


ETHELRED,

 Famous Governour,

Governour of his kinred.


ETHELVVOLPH,

EVERARD,

FABIAN, from 
Fabius,
 who had his name
from beanes, as 
Ʋalerian
 from 
Valerius Fa∣bianus

bishop of 
Rome,
 martyred vnder 
Deci∣us,

first gave reputation to this name.


FOELIX, 
Lat:

Thales
 with the
Greekes, 
Antonius

Eleutherius,

FREDERIC,

 th'English have commonly vsed

Frery

Fery,
 which hath beene now a long
time a christian name in the antient family of

Tilney,
 and luckie to their house, as they re∣port.


FREMVND, 
Sax:
 Free-peace.


FOVLK, or FVLKE, 
germ:
 Some derive it from
the German 
Vollg,
 Noble and Gallant. But
I from 
Folc,
 the English-Saxon woorde for
people, as though it were the same with 
Pub∣lius

of the 
Romanes,
 and onely translated from

Publius,
 as, beloved of the people and com∣mons.


FVLBERT, 
Sax:
 Full bright.


FVLCHER, 
Sax:
 Lord of people.


FERDINANDO, See 
Beriram.
 This name is so
variable, that I can not resolve what to say: for
the Spaniards make it 
Hernand,
 and 
Hernan,

the Italians 
Ferando,
 and 
Ferante,
 the French

Ferrant,
 which is now become a surname with
vs, and the Latines 
Ferdinandus:
 vnlesse wee
may thinke it is fetcht by transposition from

Fred,
 and 
Rand,
 that is, Pure peace.








G


GA
RIEL, 
ebr.
 Man of God, or Strength
of God.


GAMALIEL, 
hebr.
 Gods rewarde, as 
Deodatus,
Theodorus,
 and 
Theodosiu
.


GARRET, for GERARD, and GERALD: See 
E∣verard,

for from thence they are de
rted, if
we beleeve 
Ges
erus.
 But rather 
Gerard
 may
seeme to signifie,
 All 
, as 
,

All truth, 
Gerwin,
 All victorious, and the Ger∣man
nation is so named, as All and fully men.


GAVVEN, a name devised by the author of king

Arthurs
 fable, if it be not 
Walwin:
 See 
Wal∣win.


GEORGE, 
gre:
 Husbandman, the same with

Agricola,
 a name of speciall respect in 
England,

since the victorious King 
Edward
 the third
chose Saint 
George
 for his Patro
c, and the
English in all encounters, and batt
les, vsed
the name of Saint 
George
 in their cries, as the
French did, 
M
ti
y S. Denis.


GEDEON, 
Heb:
 A Breaker, or Destroyer.


GERMAN, 
Lat:

e, no
counterfeit, or a naturall brother. 
S. German,

who suppressed the Pelagian heresie in

about the yeere 430. adva
ced this
name in this Isle.


GERVAS, 
Ger
sius
 in Latine, for 
Gerfast,
 (as
some Germans coniecture) that is, All sure,
firme, or fast. If 
 be so, it is onely 
C
stans

translated. But it is the name of a 
 who
suffered vnder 
Nero
 at 
Ma
lai
,
 who if hee
were a 



was, it may signifie Grave & Antient, or Ho∣nourable,
as wrested from 
Gero

GEFFREY, 
Ger.
 from 
Gaufred,
 Ioyfull peace. 
Ki∣lianus

translateth 
Gaw.
 Ioyfull, as the French
doe 
Gay.
 That 
Fred
 and 
Frid,
 doe signifie
peace, is most certaine, as 
Fred-stole. i. Pacis
cathedra.
 See 
Frederic.


GILBERT 
germ.
 I supposed heretofore to signi∣fie
Gold-like-bright, as 
Aurelius
 or 
Aure∣lianus:

or yellow bright, as 
Fl
vius
 with the
Romans. For 
Geele
 is yellow in old Saxon,
& still in Dutch, as 
Gilvus
 according to some
in L
tin. But because it is written in Dooms∣day
booke▪ 
G
sl
bert.
 I iudge it rather to signi∣fie
Bright or brave pledge; for in old Saxon,

Gisle
 signifieth a pledge, & in the old English
booke of S. 
Augustines
 of 
Canterbury,
 sureties
and pledges for keeping the peace are called

Fredgisles.
 So it is a well fitting name for chil∣dren
whi
h are the onlye sweet pledges and
pawns of love between mā & wife, & accor∣dingly
called 
Dulcia pignora
 & 
Pignora amoris.


GILES, is miserably disjoynted from 
Aegidius,
 as

Gillet
 from 
Aegidia,
 by the French, as appea∣reth
in lustories by the name of Duke of 
Rol∣los

wife. It may seeme a Greeke name, for that
S. 
G
es,
 the first that I have read so named,
was an Athenian, and so drawne from 
Aigi¦dion,

that is, Little Kid, as we know 
Martia∣
us
Capell.
 had his name in like sense; 
or
some no
sse probably fetch 
Giles
 from 
Iu∣lius,

as 
G
ha
 from 
Iuliana.


GODFREY, 
ger.
 From 
Godfred,
 Gods-peace, or
god
v; for the D
nes call godlines 
Gudfreid∣hed.
[Ionas Turson
]


GODARD 
ger.
 Strength of God, or Gods-man
as 
Gabriel
 according to 
Luther.
 But I thinke


it rather to signifie Godly disposition or to∣ward
es,
for 
Ard
 and 
Art
 in the German
tongue,
 do signifie Towardnes, aptnes or dis∣position.
As 
Mainard,
 powerfull disposition,

Giffard,
 Liberal dispositiō, as 
Largus; Bernard,

Childlike disposition, 
Leonard
 Lionlike dis∣position,
as 
Leoninus; Re
ard,
 pure disposi∣tion,
as 
Syncerus.


GODVVIN, 
ger.
 for Win-God, converted, or
Victorious in God.


GODRICH. 
ger.
 Rich, or powerfull in God.


GREGORY 
gre.
 Watching, watchfull, as 
Vigilan∣tius,

and 
V
gilius
 in Latine.


GRYFFITH, 
Brit.
 Some Britans interpret it,
Strong-faithed.


GRVFFIN, 
Brit.
 If it be not the same with 
Grif∣fith,

some do fetch from 
Rufinus, Red.
 as many
other Welsh names are derived f
ō colours.


GRIM
ALD, 
ger.
 But truly 
Grim
ald,
 power over
anger, as 
Rodoalà
 power of councel [
uther
]
a name most vsuall in the old family of 
Pa
∣cefoote.


GVVISCHARD, See 
Wischard.


GVY, In Latine, 
Guide
 from the French 
Guide.

A guide, leader, or director to other.






H


HADRIAN, 
Lat.
 deduced from the city 
Ha∣dria,

whence 
Hadrian
 the emperor had his
orig
nall.
 
Gesner
 bringeth it from the Greeke

, Grosse or weal
hie.


HAMON, 
Heb.
 Faithfull.


HANIBALL, A
 
unick
 name. Gratious Lord.


HECTOR 
gr.
 Defendour, according to 
lat
.


HENRY, 
ger.
 in Latine 
Henricus.
 A name so fa∣mous


since the yeare 920. when 
Henry
 the
first was Emperour, that there have beene 7.
Emperours, 8. Kings of 
England,
 4. Kings of

France,
 as many of 
Spaine
 of that name. If 
Ein∣ric

be the originall, it signifieth Ever rich or
powerfull. If it be deduced from 
Herric,
 which
the Germans vse now, it is as much as Rich-Lord.
I once supposed, not without some pro∣babilitie,
that it was contracted from 
Honori∣cus,

of which name, as 
Procopius
 mention
th,
there was a Prince of the 
Vandales,
 in the time
of 
Honorius,
 and therefore likely to take name
of him, as hee did from 
Honor.
 And lately I
have found that 
Fr. Philelphus
 is of the same
opinion.
 Howsoever it hath been an ominous
good name in all respects of signification.


HENGEST, 
Sax.
 Horse man, the name of him
which led the first Englishmen into this Isle,
somewhat answerable to the Greeke names,

Philippe, Speusiprus, Ctesippus,
 his brother in like
sort was called 
Horsa.


HARHOLD, 
Sax. Luther
 interpreteth it Gover∣nour
or Generall of an Armie, and so would I
if it were 
Harwold.
 But being written 
Harhold

& 
Herold,
 I rather turne it love of the Armie.
For 
Hold
 see 
Rheinhold.
 For 
Hare
 and 
Here

that they signifie both an Armie, and a Lord,
it is taken for granted: Yet I suspect this 
Here,

for a Lord to come from the Latine 
Herus.
 See

Ethelwold.


HERBERT, 
Germ.
 Famous Lord, bright Lord, or
Glorie of the Army.


HERVVIN, 
ger.
 Victorious Lord, or Victor in
the Armie.


HARMAN, or 
Hermon, ger.
 Generall of an Army,
the same which 
Strato
 or 
Polemarchus
 in
Greeke 
Caesar
 turned it into 
Arminius [Tscu∣dus,
]


Hence the German Dukes are called

Hertogen,
 as Leaders of Armies.


HERCVLES, 
gr.
 Glorie or illumination of the
aire, as it pleaseth 
Macrobius,
 who affirmeth it
to be proper to the Sunne, but hath bin given
to valiant men for their glorie.


HIEROME, 
gr.
 Holy name.


HILDEBERT, 
germ.
 Bright, or famous Lord. See

Maud.


HILARY, 
Lat.
 Merrie and pleasant.


HOVVEL, A Brittish name, the originall whereof
some Britan may finde. 
Goropius
 turneth it
Sound or whole, as wisely as he saith, English∣men
were called 
Angli,
 because they were
good Anglers. I rather would fetch 
Hoel
 from

Haelius,
 that is, Sunne-bright, as 
Coel
 from

Caelius.


HV
H, 
Aventinus
 deriveth it from the German
word 
Hougen,
 that is, slasher or cutter. But
whereas the name 
Hugh,
 was first in vse a∣mong
the French, and 
O
frid
 in the yeare 900.
vsed 
Hugh
 for Comfort, I iudge this name to
be borrowed thence, and so it is correspon∣dent
to the Greeke names 
Elpidius,
 and 
Elpis.


HVMFREY, 
ger.
 for 
Humfred,
 House-peace, a
lovely and happie name, if it could turne
home-warres betweene man and wife into
peace. The Italians have made 
Onuphrius
 of it
in Latine.


HVBERT, 
Sax.
 Bright forme, faire shape, or faire
hope.


HORATIO, I know not the Etymologie, vnlesse
you will derive from the Greeke 
, that
is, wel sighted.








J


IACO

Heb.
 A tripper, or supplanter. Whose
name because he had power with God, that
he might also prevaile with men, was changed
into

Iohn
 of 
England
 well neare,
lost his Kingdome; and 
Iohn
 of 
France
 was
long captive in 
England;
 and 
Iohn Balioll
 was
lifted out of his Kingdome of 
Scotland;
 that

Iohn Steward
 when the Kingdome of 
Scot∣land

came vnto him, renouncing that name,
would be proclaimed King 
Robert.
 See 
Iuon.


IOB,

Iu∣stulus

according to 
Islebius,
 but molefied from

Iostelin,
 in the old Netherland language, from
whence it came with 
Ioscelin
 of 
Lovan,
 yon∣ger
sonne of 
Godfrey
 Duke of 
Brabant,
 Pro∣genitour
of the honourable 
Percyes,
 if not the
first, yet the most noble of that name in this


Realme. 
Nicotius
 maketh it a diminitive from

Iost Iudocus.


IOSEPH,

Phil

IOSIAS, 
Heb.
 Fire of the Lord.

Engelbert.


INGRAM, 
Germ: Engelramus
 in Latine, deduced
from 
Engell
 which signifieth an Angell, as

to signifie bright Angell.


ISAAC, 
Heb:

Gelasius

ISRAEL, 
Heb.
 Seeing the Lord, or prevailing in
the Lord: See 
Iacob.


IVLIVS,

 Soft haired or mossie bearded, so
doth 
Iulus
 signifie in Greeke. It was the name
of 
Aeneas
 sonne, who was first called 
Ilus.


Ilus erat dum res stetit Ilia regno.


The old Englishmen in the North parts turned

Iulius
 into 
Ioly,
 and the vnlearned Scribes of that
time may seeme to have turned 
Iulianus,
 into 
Io∣lanus,

for that name doth often occurre in olde
evidences.


IVON, is the same with 
Iohn,
 and vsed by the
Welsh, and 
Sclav
nians
 for 
Iohn;
 and in this
Realme about the Conquerours time 
Iohn

was rarely found, but 
Iuon
 as I have observed.


IONATHAN,

 The same with 
Theodorus,
 and

Theodosius,
 that is, Gods gift.

LANCELOT seemeth a Spanish name, and may

 In our auncient tongue 
Leod
 sig∣nified
people of one Citie, as 
Leodscip,
 was to
them

 The northerne Germans
have yet 
Leud
 in the same sense. So 
Luti, Li
di,
Leuti,
 and 
Leudi,
 as the Dialect varieth, signi∣fies
people. In which sence, the Normans in
the life of 
Carolus Magnus
 were called 
Nort∣leud.

The names wherein

 54.

but most in former times in the noble families
of 
Tweng, Lumley,

 translated.


MARKE In Hebrew signifieth High, but in La∣tine,

MOSES,

MORGAN, 
Brit▪
 the same with 
Pelagius,
 that is,
Se
man, if we may beleeve an olde fragment,
and 
Mor
 signifies the Sea among the Welsh:
So 
Marius, Marinus, Marianus,

Pontius
 a∣mong
the Latines have their name from 
Ma∣re

and 
Pontus
 the Sea. 
Qu

MAVGER, a name eftsoones vsed in the wor∣shipfull
family of 
Vavasors. Malgerius,

Quare.


MORICE, from the Latine 
M
itius,
 and that
from 
Maurus,
 A Moore, as 
Syritius
 from 
Sy∣us

a Sy

his owne signification, but in respect of Saint

Maurice
 a Commander in the Thebane Le∣gion
martyred for the Christian profession
vnder 
Maximianus.






N


NATHANIEL, 
Hebr:
 The gift of God, as

Theod

NEALE,

 Blackish, or swart, for it is abrid∣ged


from 
Nigel,
 and so alwayes written, in La∣tine
records 
Nigellus,
 consonant to 
Nigrinus,

Atrius
 of the Latines,

of the Graecians.

Filius familiàs,
[Luther.
]


OSBERT, 
Sax.
 Domesticall brightnes, or light of
the family.


OSMVND, 
Sax.
 House-peace.


OSVVOLD, 
Ger.
 House-ruler or Steward: for

Wold
 in old English and high Dutch, is a Ru∣ler:
but for this the Normans brought in 
Le∣despencer

now 
Spencer.
 The holy life of S. 
Os∣wald

King of 
Northumberland,
 who was in∣cessantly
in prayer hath given much honour
to this name. See 
Ethelwold.


OTHES, An old name in 
England,
 drawne from

Otho,
 written by some 
Odo,
 and by others, 
Eu∣do,

in English-Saxon 
Odan,
 and after the


originall,
 whereof when 
 could not
finde, I will not seeke. 
Av
nt
s
 maketh it

Hud,
 that is, Keeper: but 
Petr
 Bles
sis Epist.

126. maketh it to signifie a Faithfull recon∣ciler;
for he writeth, 
Od
 in Episc
pum Parision∣sem
consecratus nomen s
is operibus interpret
i
non cessat, fidelis sequester inter deum & 
.
Ottwell
 and 
Ottey
 seeme to bee nursenames
drawne from 
Othes.


OVVEN, 
Lat. Audoenus,
 if it be the same with S.

Owen
 of 
France.
 But the Britans will have it
from old King 
Oenus
 father in law to 
Hercu∣les;

others from 
Eugenius,
 that is, Noble or well
borne. Certaine it is that the Country of 
Ire∣land

called 
Tir-Oen,
 is in Latine Records, 
Ter∣ra
Eugenij;
 and the Irish Priests know no La∣t
ne
for their 
Oen
 but 
Eugenius,
 as 
Rothericus

for Rorke. And Sir 
Owen Ogle
 in Latine Re∣cords,
as I have beene enformed, was written

Eugenius Ogle.


ORIGINALL, May seeme to be deducted from
the Greeke 
Origenos,
 that is, Borne in good
time.






P


PASCAL, Deduced from 
Pascha,
 the Passo∣ver.


PATRIK, 
Lat.
 From 
Patricius, Quasi Patram cians,

A Peere or State, he which could cite his fa∣ther
as a man of honour. A name given first
to 
Senators
 sonnes, but it grew to reputation
when 
Constantin
 the Greeke made a new state


of 
Patricij,
 who had place befor the 
Praefectus
Praet
ri
,
 or Lord great Master of the house, if
it may be so translated [
Zosim
s.
]


PAVL, 
Heb.
 Wonderfull or rest: But the learned

Baronius
 drawing it from the Latine, maketh
it Little, or Humble.


PAVLIN, From 
Paul,
 at 
Nigrinus
 from 
Niger.


PERCIVAL, Is thought at first to have bin a sur∣name,
and after (as many other) a Christian
n
me: fetched from 
P
rcheval,
 a place in 
Nor∣mandie.

One by allusion made this 
Percival,
Per se valens.


PAYN, in 
Lat. Paganus,
 exempt from militarie ser∣vice,
a name now out of vse, but having an op∣posite
signification to a millitarie man, as 
Scali∣ger

observeth vpon 
Ansdnius.


PETRE, For which as the French vsed 
Pierre:
 so
our Ancestours vsed 
Pierce,
 a name of high
esteeme among the Christians, since our Savi∣our
named 
Simon,
 the sonne of 
Iona, Cephas,

which is by interpretation a stone, 
Ioan.

5. 42. But fole-wisely have some 
Petres,
 cal∣led
themselves 
Pierius.


PEREGRINE, 
Lat.
 Strange, or outlandish.


PHILEBERT, 
Ger.
 Much bright fame, or very
bright and famous, as 
Polyphemus
 in Greeke
[
Rhenanus.
]


PHILIPPE, 
Gr.
 A lover of horses, 
Philip B
roald

conceiting this his name, very clerckly proveth
that 
Phillippe
 is an Apostolicall name by Saint

Philip
 the Apostle, a royall name by King 
Phi∣lip

King of 
Macedonia,
 and an imperiall name
by 
Philip
 the first Christian Emperour.


POSTHVMVS, 
Lat.
 Borne after his fathers death.








Q


QVINTIN, 
Lat.
 From 
Quintus,
 the fifth
borne, a man dignified by Saint 
Qu
tin
 of

France.






R


RALFE, 
Germ.
 Contracted from 
Radulph,

which as 
Rodulph
 signifieth Help-councell,
not differing much from the Greeke 
Eubulus.


RAYMVND, 
Germ.
 Quiet peace, as 
Hesichius
 in
Greeke.


RANDAL, 
Sax.
 Corrupted from 
Ra
ulph,
 that is,
Faire helpe.


RAPHAEL, 
Heb:
 The Phisicke of God.


REINHOLD, 
Sax.
 Sincere or pure love: for the
Germans call their greatest and goodliest ri∣ver
for purenes 
Rheine,
 and the old English
vsed 
Hold
 for love, 
Holdlic,
 for lovely, as 
Vn∣hold,

without love:
 
Willeranus
 vseth 
Hold
 for
favour, which is answerable to love. I have
also observed 
Hold
 for Firme, and once for a
Generall of an armie.


RHESE, A British name, deduced as they thinke
from 
Rh
sus
 the 
Thracian
 King, who was
(as 
Homer
 describeth him by his Armour,)
of a Giantlike stature. But I dare not say the
wordimplieth so much in signification: yet

Rhesi,
 signifieth a Giant in the German tong.



RICHARD, 
Sax.
 Powerfull and rich disposition,
as 
Richer,
 an antient Christian name, signified
Powerfull in the Armie, or Rich Lord, and
was but 
Herr
 reversed, 
Aventinus
 turneth it,
Treasure of the kingdome. See 
Aubry.


ROBERT, 
Germ.
 Famous in Councell, for it is
written most anciently 
Rodbert. Rod, Red,
 and

Rod,
 do signifie councell, See 
Conrad
 and 
Al∣bert.

This name was given to 
Rollo,
 first
Duke of 
Normandy,
 an originall Ancestour
of the Kings of 
England,
 who was called first
by the Normans and French 
Rou,
 wherevn∣to,
some without ground thinke that 
Bert
 was
added: so that it should signifie 
Rou,
 the re∣nowmed.
Others vntruly turne it 
Red-
eard,

as thogh it were al one with 
Aenobarbus
 of the
Latines, or 
Barbarossa
 of the Italians, 
Iohn Bo∣din

(or Pudding,) that I may give him his true
English name, maketh it full wisely 
Red-bara;

but I thinke no 
Robert
 which knoweth what

Bardus
 meaneth, will like of it.


ROGER,
 
Ger. Ruger,
 Quiet, the same with 
Tran∣quilles

in Latine, 
Frodoard
 writeth it alwaies

Rottgarius,
 or 
Rodgarus,
 so it seemeth to signi∣fie
All councell, or strong councell.


ROLLAND, 
Ger.
 Whereas it was anciently writ∣ten

Rod, land,
 it may seem to signifie Councell
for the Land. And the first that I finde so na∣med,
was land-wardē in 
France,
 vnder 
Carolus
Magn
s,
 against the Piracies of the Normans.
The Italians vse 
Orland
 for 
Rowland
 by 
Me∣tathesis.


ROMANE, 
Lat.
 Strong, from the Greeke 

answerable to 
Ʋalens.


RVBEN, 
Heb.
 The sonne of visions, or a quick∣seeing
sonne. [
Philo.

REINFRED, 
Sax.
 Pure peace.

S
ASTIAN, 
gre:

Augustus
 or 
Augustinus
 among the Romans.


SIG
SMVND, 
germ:
 Victo
 peace, 
 victo∣ry
with peace;
 That 
Sig
 signifieth 
Victorie,
A
frie, Das
podius,
 and 
Luther
 do all agree, yet

Hadr: 
 turneth it Victorious or prevai∣ling
speech. So 
Sigward,
 now 
Seward,
 victo∣rious
preserver, 
Sigh
m,
 victorious defence,

Sighere,
 Conqueror of an army, or victorious
Lord: and 
Sigbert,
 now 
Sebright,
 victorious
fame, or fame by victory.


SILVESTER,

with the Romans. This name hath bin
taken vp in honour of Saint 
Swithin
 the holie
Bishop of 
W
nchester
 about the y

and called the Weeping saint 
,
 for that
about his feast 
Praesepe
 and 
Aselli,
 
 con∣stellanons

 Cosmic

cause raine.








T


THEOBALD, 
mmonly 
Tibald,
 and 
Thibald,

Gods power, as 
B: Rhenanius
 noteth.
But certaine it is, that in our Saxon Psalter

Gentes
 is alwayes translated by 
Theod,
 and in
the English-Saxon old Annales, the English
nation is often called 
Engl
-th
d.
 The same

Lips
 in Poli
ceticis
 affirmeth to be in the
auntient German Psalters. So that 
Theobald

seemeth in his opinion to signifie Powerfull,
or bolde over people. It was the common
name in the familie of the 
Gorges;
 and of the
Lord 
Verdons,
 of whom the Earles of 
Shr
ws∣burie,

and 
Essex
 are descended.


THEODORE, 
gre:
 Gods gift, now corruptly by
the Welsh-Britans called 
Tydder.


THEODOSIVS, 
gre:
 the same with 
Theodore.


THEODERIC, 
ger:

THEOPHILVS,

hebr:
 Bottomles deepe, or Twinne.


TIMOTHY, 
gre:

 Honou

God.


TOBIAS, 
hebr:
 The Lord is good.


TRISTRAM, I knowe not whether the first of
this name was christned by king 
Arthurs
 fa∣bl
r.
If it be the same which the French 
all

Trist
,
 it commeth from sorrow: for 
P. Ae∣mi
ius

noteth that the sonne of Saint 
Lewes
 of

Franc
,
 horne in the heavie sorrowfull time of
his fathers imprisonment vnder the Saracens,
was named 
Tristan
 in the same respect.


TVRSTAN, 
Sax:
 for 
Trustan,
 most true and
trustie, as it seemeth.








Ʋ


VALENS, 
Lat:
 Puissant.


VALENTINE, 
Lat:

VCHTRED, 
ger:
 High counsell, vsed in the old
family of 
Raby.
 From whence the 
Nevilles.


VINCENT,

VITAL,

 Hee that may live a long life, like
to 
Macrobius;
 or Lively, the same that 
Zosimus

in Greeke.


VIVIAN, 
Lat:
 the same.


VRBANVS, 
Lat:
 Curteous, civill.


VRIAN, The same with 
George,
 as I have heard
of some learned Danes. It hath beene a com∣mon
name in the family of Saint 
Pier
 of 
Ches∣shire,

now extinguished.






W


VVALTER, 
ger:
 from 
Waldher,
 for so it is
most auntiently written, a Pilgrime
according to 
Reneccius;
 other make it a Wod-Lorde,
or a Wood-man, aunswerable to the
name of 
Silvius,
 
Silvanus,
 or 
Sylvester.
 The
old English called a wood, 
Wald,
 and an her∣mite
living in the woods, a 
Waldbro
der.
 But
if I may cast in my conceit, I take it to be 
Her∣wald

inverted, as 
Herric
 and 
Richer, Winbald



and 
Baldwin.
 And so it signifieth Governour
or Generall of an Arm
e, as 
Hegesistratus,
 See

Herman
 and 
Harold:


WALVVIN, Some have interpreted out of the
German tongue, a Conquerour, as 
Nicho∣laus

and 
Nicodemus, Victor
 in Latine; but wee
now vse 
Gawen
 insteede of 
Walwyn, Architre∣nius

maketh it 
Walganus
 in Latine. But if 
Wal∣win

was a Britan, and king 
Arthurs
 nephew,
as 
W: Malmesbury
 noteth, where hee speaketh
of his giant-like bones found in 
Wales,
 I re∣ferre
the signification to the Britans.


WARIN, 
Iovianus libr. 1. de Aspiratione
 draw∣eth
it from 
rro.
 But whereas it is written in
all Records. 
Guarinus:
 It may seeme molli∣fied
from the Dutch 
Gerwm,
 that is, All-vi∣ctorious.
See 
Gertrud.


WILLIAM, 
ge:
 For sweeter sound drawne from

Wilhelm,
 which is interpreted by 
Luther,

Much Defence, or, Defence to many, as

Wilwald,
 Ruling many. 
Wildred,
 Much re∣verent
feare, or Awfull. 
Wilfred,
 Much peace.

Willibert,
 Much brightnesse, or Very bright.

Willibrod
 Much increase. So the French that
cannot pronounce 
W
 have turnd it into 
Phil∣li,

as 
Phillibert,
 for 
Willibert,
 Much brightnes.
Many names wherein wee have 
Will,
 seeme
translated from the Greeke names composed
of 
, as 
Polydamas, Polybius, Polyxenus, &c.
Helm
 yet remaineth with vs,
 and 
Villi, Willi,

and 
Bills
 yet with the Germans for 
Many.
 O∣ther
turne 
William,
 a Willing Defender, and
so it answereth the Roman 
Titus,
 if it come
from 
Tuendo,
 as some will have it. The Ita∣lians
that liked the name, but could not pro∣nounce
the 
W
 if wee may beleeve 
Gesner,
 tur∣ned
it into 
Galeazo,
 retaining the sence in part


for 
Helme.
 But the Italians report, that 
Ga∣leazo

the first Viscount of 
Mill
 was so cal∣led,
for that many Cockes crew lustily at his
birth. This name hath beene most common
in 
England
 since king 
William
 the Conqueror,
insomuch that vppon a festivall day in the
Court of king 
Henry
 the second, when Sir

William Saint-Iohn,
 and Sir 
William Fitz-Ha∣mon

especiall Officers had commaunded that
none but of the name of 
William
 should d
e
in the great Chamber with them, they were
accompanied with an hundred and twentie

Williams,
 all Knights, as 
Robert Moutensis
 re∣cordeth

Anno
 1173.


WILLFRED, 
Sax:
 Much peace.


WIMVND, 
Sax:
 Sacred peace, or holy peace, as

Wibert,
 Holy and Bright; for 
Wi,
 in 
Wille∣ramus

is translated 
Sacer.


WISCHARD, or GVI
CARD, 
Norm:
 Wilie, and
crafty shifter: [
W: Gemiticensis] Falcandus

the Italian interpreteth it 
Erro,
 that is, Wan∣derer.
But in a Norman name I rather be∣leeve
the Norman Writer.


WOLSTAN, 
Sax:
 Comely, decent, as 
Decentius,
[Dasipodius.
]


WVLPHER, 
Sax:
 Helper, the Saxon name of a
King of Middle-
England,
 answering to the
Greeke name 
Alexias,
 or rather 
Epicurus.
 The
most famous of which name was a hurtefull
man, albeit he had a helpefull name.

Iohn.
 In latter yeeres, some of the
better and nicer sorte misliking

mollified the name of

Iane,
 as it may
seeme, for that 
Iane
 is never found in olde
Recordes: and as some will, never before the
time of king 
Henry
 the eight. Lately in like
sort some learned 
Iohns

Hanses

the name of

of the Italians from 
Mabella,
 that
is, my faire daughter, or maide. But whereas
it is written in Deedes,

I thinke it commeth from

WINEFRID, 
Sax.
 Win, or get peace. If it be a

Britaine
 word, as some thinke it to be & writ∣ten

Guinfrid,
 it signifieth Faire and Beautifull
countenance. Verily 
Winifred
 a native of this
Isle, which preached the Gospel in 
Germany,

was called 
Boniface;
 for his good face, or good
deedes, iudge you.


OTher vsuall names of women I do not call
to remembrance at this time, yet I know
many other have beene in vse in former ages
among vs, as 
Derv
rgild, Sith, Amphilas, &c:

And also 
Nicholea, Laurentia, Richarda, Gui∣lielma,
Wilmetta,
 drawne from the names of
men, in which number we yet retaine 
Philip∣pa,
Philip, Francisca, Francis, Ioanna, Iana, &c.



These English-Saxon, German and other names may be
thought as faire, and as fit for men and women, as those
most vsuall 
Praenomina
 among the Romans, 
 for that
hee was nourished of the gods: 
Luciu
 for him that was
borne in the dawning of the day: 
Marcus,
 for him that was
borne in March: 
Manius
 for him that was borne in the mor∣ning:

Cneus
 for him that had a wart: 
Servius
 for him that
was borne a slave, 
Quinctius
 for him that was fift borne, &c.
And our womens names more gratious than their 
Rutilia,

that is, Red-head: 
Caesilia,
 that is, Grey-eyed, and 
Caia
 the
most common name of all among them (signifying 
oy:)
for that 
Caia Caesilia
 the wife of King 
Tarquinius Priscus
 was
the best distasse-wife and spinster among them.


Neither doe I thinke in this comparison of Names, that
any will proove like the Gentleman, who distasting our
names, preferred King 
Arthurs
 age before ours, for the gal∣lant,
brave, and stately names then vsed, as sir 
Orson,
 sir 
Tor,

sir 
Quadragan,
 sir 
Dinadan,
 sir 
Launcelot, &c.
 which came
out of that forge, out of the which the Spaniard forged the
haughty and lofty name 
Traquitantos
 for his Giant, which
hee so highly admired, when hee had studied many dayes
and odde houres, before hee could hammer out a name so
conformable to such a person as hee in imagination then
conceited.










Surnames.


S
Vrnames given for difference of

amilies, and continued as heredi∣tary
in families, were vsed in no na∣tion
antiently but among the Ro∣mans,
(and that after the league
with the 
Sabines
) which called thē

Nomina,
 and 
Nomina Gentilitia,
 as
the former were called 
Praenomina.

But the French and wee termed
them 
Surnames,
 not because they are names of the sire, or
the father, but because they are super-added to Christian
names, as the Spaniards call them 
Renombres,
 as 
Renames.


The Hebrewes keeping memory of their Tribe, vsed
in their Genealogies in steede of 
Surnames,
 the name of
their father with 
Ben,
 that is, Sonne, as 
Melchi Ben-Addi,
Addi Ben-Cosam, Cosam Ben-E
adam, &c.
 So the Graeci∣ans,

, 
Icarus
 the sonne of 
Dedalus, Deda∣lus

the sonne of 
Eupalmus, Eupalmus
 the sonne of 
Metion.


The like was vsed amongst our auncestors the English,
as 
C
oured Ceolwalding, Ceolwald Cuthing, Cuth Cuthwining,

that is, 
Ceonred
 so
ne of 
Ceolwald, Ceolwald
 sonne of 
Cuth,
Cuthe
 son of 
Cuthwin,
 &c. And to this is observed by 
Willi∣am

of 
Malmesbury,
 where he noteth that the sonne of 
Ead∣gar

was called 
Eadgaring,
 and the son of 
Edmund, Edmunding.


The Britans in the same sence with 
Ap
 for 
Mab,
 as 
Ap O∣wen,
Owen Ap Harry, Harry Ap Rhese,
 as the Irish with
their 
Mac,
 as 
Donald Mac Neale, Neale Mac Con, Con Mac
D
rm
tt, &c.
 And the olde Normans with 
Fitz
 for 
Filz,
 as

Iohn Fitz-Robert, Robert Fitz-Richard, Richard Fitz-Ralph,


&c.
 The Arabians onely as one learned noteth, vsed their
fathers names without their owne forename, as 
Aven-Pace,
Aven Rois, Aven-Z
ar,
 that is, the sonne of 
Pace, Rois
 and

Zoar;
 As if 
Pace
 had a sonne at his circumcision named 
Haly,

hee would be called 
Aven Pace,
 concealing 
Haly,
 but his
sonne, howsoever hee were named, would be called 
Aven-Haly,
&c.
 So Surnames passing from father to sonne, and
cōtinuing to their issue, was not antiently in vse among any
people in the world.


Yet to these single Names were adioyned oftentimes o∣ther
names, as 
Cognomina,
 or 
Sobriquetts,
 as the 
French
 call
them, and By-names, or Nicke-names, as we terme them,
if that word be indifferent to good and bad, which still did
die with the bearer, and never descended to posteritie. That
we may not exemplifie in other nations (which would af∣forde
great plenty,) but in our own. King 
Eadgar
 was called
the Peaceable, king 
Ethelred
 the Vnreadie, king 
Edmund

for his Valour, 
Iron-side;
 king 
Harold
 the Hare-foote, 
Eadric

the 
Streona,
 that is, the Getter or Streiner, 
Siward
 the 
Dege∣ra,

that is, the Valiant, King 
William
 the first, Bastard,
king 
William
 the second 
Rouse,
 that is, the Red, king 
Henry

the first 
Beauclarke,
 that is, Fine Scholler: so in the house of

Aniou
 which obtained the Crowne of 
England, Geffrey
 the
first Earle of 
Aniou
 was surnamed 
Grisogonel,
 that is, Grey-cloake,

Fulco
 his sonne 
Nerra,
 his grand-childe 
Rechi
,
 for
his extortion. Againe, his grand-childe 
Plantagenet,
 for
that he ware commonly a broome-stalke in his bonnet. His
sonne 
Henry
 the second, king of 
England, Fitz-Empresse,
 be∣cause
his mother was Empresse, his sonne king 
Richard
 had
for surname 
Corde-Lion,
 for his lion-like courage, as 
Iohn

was called 
Sans-terre,
 that is, Without land: So that wher∣as
these names were never taken vp by the sonne, I knowe
not why any should thinke 
Plantagenet
 to be the surname
of the royall house of 
England,
 albeit in late yeeres many
have so accounted it. Neither is it lesse strange, why so ma∣ny
should thinke 
Theodore
 or 
Tydur,
 as they contract it, to
be the surname of the Princes of this Realme since king



Henry
 the seaventh. For albeit 
Owen ap Mer
dith Tydur,

which married 
Katharine
 the daughter of 
Charles
 the sixth
king of 
France,
 was grandfather to king 
Henry
 the seventh,
yet that 
Tydur,
 or 
Theodore
 was but the Christian name of

Owens
 grandfather. For 
Owens
 father was 
Meredith ap Ty∣dur,
Ap Grone, Ap Tydur,
 who all without Surnames itera∣ted
Christian names, after the olde manner of the 
Britaines,

and other nations heeretofore noted, and so lineally dedu∣ced
his pedegree from 
Cadwallader
 king of the 
Britans,
 as
was found by Commission directed to 
Griffin ap Lewellin;
Gitteu Owen, Iohn King,
 and other learned men both English
and Welsh in the seaventh yeare of the said king 
Henry
 the
seventh.


Likewise in the line Royall of 
Scotland, Milcolme,
 or

Malcolme
 was surnamed 
Canmore,
 that is, Great head, and
his brother, 
Donald, Ban,
 that is, White: 
Alexander
 the
first, the Prowde, 
Malcolme
 the fourth, the Virgine,

William
 his brother the Lion. As amongest the Princes of

Wales, Brochvail Schitrauc,
 that is, 
Gaggtothed, Gurind,
Barmbtruch,
 that is, Spade-bearded, 
Elidir Coscorvaur,
 that
is, 
Heliodor
 the Great house-keeper, and so in 
Ireland Mu∣rough
Duff.
 that is, Blacke: 
 
Roo.
 that is, Red:

Nemoliah,
 that is, full of wounds: 
Patric Ban,
 that is, White:

Gavelc
,
 that is, Fetters.


To seeke therefore the auntient Surnames of the royall,
and most antient families of 
Europe,
 is to seeke that which
never was. And, therefore greatly are they deceived which
thinke 
Valoys
 to have beene the surname of the late French
kings, or 
Borbon
 of this present king, or 
Habsburg,
 or 
Austri∣ac

of the Spanish king, or 
Steward
 of the late kings of 
Scot∣land,

and now of BRITAINE, or 
Oldenburg
 of the Danish;
For (as all know that have but sipped of Histories) 
Valoys

was but the Apponage and Earledome of 
Charles
 yonger
sonne to 
Philip▪
 the second, from whome the late kings des∣cended:
so 
Borbon
 was the inheritance of 
Robert
 a yonger
sonne to saint 
Lewes,
 of whom this king is descended: 
Habs∣burg

and 
Austria
 were but the olde possessions of the Em∣perors


and Spanish Kings progenitours. 
Steward
 was but
the name of office to 
Walter,
 who was high Steward of

Scotland,
 the progenitour of 
Robert
 first King of Scots of
that family, and of the King our Soveraigne. And 
Olden∣burg

was but the Erledome of 
Christian
 the first 
Danish
 king
of this family, elected about 1448. But yet 
Pl
tagenet,
Steward, Ʋalois, Borbon, Habsburg,
 &c. by prescription of
time have prevailed so farre, as they are now accounted
surnames. But for surnames of Princes, well said the learned

Marcus,
 
Salon de Pace. Reges cognomiue now vt
ntur, q
ia vt
Regum familiae, & agnationes, & memoriae conserventur, 

cognomina non sunt necessaria prout in alijs inferioribus, quo∣rum
ipsa cognomina agnationum ac familiarum memori

tutantur.


About the yeare of our Lord 1000. (that we may not
minute out the time) surnames beganne to be taken vp in

France,
 and in 
England
 about the time of the Conquest, or
else a very little before, vnder King 
Edward
 the Confessor,
who was all Frenchified. And to this time doe the Scot∣tishmen
referre the antiquitie of their surnames,
 although

Buchanan
 supposeth that they were not in vse in 
Scotland

many yeares after.


But in 
England
 certaine it is, that as the better sort, even
from the Conquest by little and little tooke surnames, so
they were not setled among the common people fully, vn∣till
about the time of King 
Edward
 the second: but still va∣ried
according to the fathers name, as 
Richardson,
 if his fa∣ther
were 
Richard, Hodgeson,
 if his father were 
Roger,
 or in
some other respect, and from thenceforth beganne to be e∣stablished,
(some say by statute,) in their posteritie.


This will seeme strange to some Englishmen and Sco∣tishmen,
which like the Arcadians thinke their surnames as
ancient as the Moone, or at the least to reach many an age
beyond the Conquest. But they which thinke it most
strange, (I speake vnder correction,) I doubt they will hard∣ly
finde any surname which descended to posteritie before
that time: Neyther have they seene (I feare) any deede or


donation before the Conquest, but subsigned with crosses
and single names, without surnames in this manner in 
Eng∣land;

 
Ego Eadredus confirmavi.
 ✚ 
Ego Edmundus corrobo∣ravi.

✚ 
Ego Sigarius conclusi.
 ✚ 
Ego Olfstanus consolidavi,

&c. Likewise for 
Scotland,
 in an old booke of 
Duresme
 in
the Charter, whereby 
Edgare
 sonne of King 
Malcolme,

gave lands neere 
Coldingham
 to that Church, in the yeare
1097. the Scottish Noblemen witnesses therevnto, had
no other surnames than the Christian names of their fa∣thers.
For thus they signed S.
 ✚ 
Gulfi filij M
niani,
 S ✚

Culverti filij Donecani,
 S ✚ 
Olavi filij Oghe, &c.
 As for my
selfe, I never hitherto found any hereditarie Surname be∣fore
the Conquest, neither any that I know: and yet both
I my selfe and divers whom I know, have pored and pus∣led
vpon many an old Record and Evidence to satisfie our
selves heerein: and for my part I will acknowledge my selfe
greatly indebted to them that wil cleare me this doubt.


But about the time of the Conquest, I observed the ve∣ry
primary beginnings as it were of many surnames, which
are thought very antient, when as it may be proved that their
very lineall Progenitors bare other names within these sixe
hundred yeers. 
Mortimer
 and 
Warren
 are accounted names
of great antiquitie,
 yet the father of them (for they were bre∣thren)
who first bare those names, was 
Walterus de sancto
Martino.
 He that first tooke the name of 
Clifford
 from his
habitation, was the sonne of 
Richard,
 sonne of 
Puntz
 a no∣ble
Norman,
 who had no other name. The first 
Lumley

was sonne of an antient English man called 
Liwulph.
 The
first 
Gifford,
 from whome they of 
Buckingham,
 the Lords of

Brimesfeld,
 and others descended, was the sonne of a Nor∣man
called 
Osbert de Belebe
.
 The first 
Windsor
 descended
from 
Walter
 the sonne of 
Other Castellan
 of 
Windsor.
 The
first who tooke the name of 
Shirley
 was the sonne of 
Sewall,

descended from 
Fulcher
 without any other name. The first

Nevill
 of them which are now, from 
Robert
 the sonne of

Maldred,
 a braunch of an olde English familie who married

Isabel
 the daughter and heire of the 
Nevills
 which came out


of 
Normandy.
 The first 
Level
 came from 
 de Perce
ll.

The first 
Montacute
 was the sonne of 
Drogo 
venis,
 as it is in
Record. The first 
Stanley
 of them now Earles of 
Derby
 was
likewise sonne to 
Ad
vn de Aldeleigh,
 or 
Audley,
 as it is in the
olde Pedegree in the Eagle tower of 
Latham.
 And to omit
others, the first that tooke the name of 
de Burgo,
 or 
Burks
 in

Ireland
 was the sonne of an English man called 
William Fitz
Aldelni
;
 as the first of the 
Girald
es
 also in that Countrey
was the sonne of an Englishman called 
Girald
 of 
Windsor.
 In
many more could I exemplifie, which shortly after the con∣quest,
tooke these surnames, when either their fathers had
none at all, or else most different, whatsoever some of their
posteritie doe overweene of the antiquitie of their names, as
though in the continuall mutabilitie of the worlde, conver∣sions
of States, and fatall periods of families, five hundred
yeeres were not sufficient antiquitie for a family or name,
whenas but very few have reached thereunto.


In the autentical Record of the Exchequer called 
Domes∣day,

Surnames are first found, brought in then by the Nor∣mans,
who not long before first tooke them: but most no∣ted
with 
de,
 such a place as 
Godefridus de Mannevilla; A. de
Grey. Walterus de Vernon; Robert de Oily,
 now 
Doyley; Al∣bericus
de Vere; Radulphus de Pomerey; Goscelinus de Dive.
Robertus de Busl
 Guilielmus de Moiun; R. de Brai
se; Roge∣rus
de Lacy; Gislebertus de Venables,
 or with 
Filius,
 as 
Ranul∣phus,
Asculphi, Guilielmis; filius Osbernie, Richardus filius Gisle∣berti;

or else with the name of their office, as 
Eudo Depifer:
Guil: Camerarius, Hervaeus Legatus, Gislebertus Cocus, Radul∣phus
Venator:
 but very many with their Christian names on∣lie,
as 
Olaff, Nigellus, Eustachius, Baldricus,
 with single names
are noted last in every shire, as men of least account, and
as all, or most vnderholders specified in that Booke. But
shortly after, as the Romans of better sorte had three names
according to that of 
Iuvenal, Tanquam habeas trianomina,
 &
that of 
Ausonius,
 
Tria nomina nobiliorum.
 So it seemed a dis∣grace
for a Gentleman to have but one single name, a
 the
meaner sorte and bastards had. For the daughter and 



of 
Fitz-
 a great Lord, as 
Robert
 of 
Gloucester
 in the
Librarie of the industrious Antiquary maister 
Iohn Stowe

writeth, when king 
Henry
 the first would have married hir
to his base sonne 
Robert,
 she first refusing answered;


It were to me a great shame,


To have a Lord without'n his twa name.


whereupon the king his father gave him the name of 
Fitz-Roy,

who after was earle of 
Gloucester,
 and the onely Wor∣thy
of his age.


To reduce surnames to a Methode, is matter for a 
Ra∣mist,

who should happly finde it to be a 
Typocosmie:
 I will
plainely set downe from whence the most have beene de∣duced,
as farre as I can conceive, hoping to incurre no of∣fence
heerein with any person, when I protest in all sinceri∣tie,
that I purpose nothing lesse than to wrong any man in
any respect, or to make the least aspersion vpon any who∣soever.
The end of this scribling labour tending onely to
maintaine the honor of our names against some Italianated,
who admiring strange names, doe disdainefully contemne
their owne countrey names: which I doubt not but I shall
effect with the learned and iudicious, to whom I submit all
that I shall write.


The most surnames in number, the most antient, and of
best accompt, have been locall, deduced from places in 
Nor∣mandy

and the countries confining, being either the patri∣monaill
possessions or native places of such as served the
Conquerour, or came in after out of 
Normandy;
 as 
Aulbeny,

or 
Mortimer, Warren, Albigny, Percy, Gournay, Devreux, Tan∣kervil,
Saint-Lo, Argenton, Marmion,

Maigny, Nevill, Ferrers, Harecourt, Baskervile, Mortaigne,
Tracy, Beufoe, Ʋaloyns, Cayly, Lucy, Montfort, Bonvile, Bovil,
Auranch,
 &c. Neither is there any village in 
Normandy,
 that
gave not denomination to some family in 
England;
 in which
number are all names, having the French 
De, Du, Des, De-la

prefixt, & beginning or ending with 
Font, Fant, Beau, Sainct
Mont, Bois, Aux, Eux, Vall, Vaux, Cort, Court, Fort, Champ,
Vil,
 which is corruptly turned in some into 
eld,
 as in 
Ba
ker∣feld,


Somerfeld, Dangerfeld, Trubl
feld, Gr
feld, 
,

for 
B
kervil, Somervil, Dangervil, Turbervil, Gree
vil, 

vil;
 and in others into 
Well,
 as 
Boswell
 for 
B
ssevil, 

for 
Freschevil.
 As that I may note in passage, the 

Nobilitie take their names from places adding 
Ski
 or 
Ki

thereunto.


Out of places in
 Britaine 
came the families of Saint
 Au∣bin,
Mor
ey, D
nant, 
lately called
 Denham, D
le, Bal
, Con∣quest,
Valtort, Lascells, Bluet, &c.


Out of other partes of
 Fraunce 
from places of the same
names came,
 Courtney, Corby, B
ll
in, Crevecuer, Sai
t-Leger,
Bohun, Saint George, Saint Andrew, Chaworth, Sainct Qu
ti
,
Gorges, Villiers, Cromar, Paris, Reims, Cressy, Fines, 
,
Coignac, Lyons, Chalons, Chaloner, Estampes, 
or
 Stampes, 
and
many more.


Out of the Netherlands came the names of 
Levayne,
Gaunt, Ipres, Bruges, Malines, Odingsells, Tournay, Doway, Bu∣ers,
Beke;
 and in latter ages 
Dabridgecourt, Robsert, M
y,
Grand
son,
 &c.


From places in
 England 
and
 Scotland 
infinite likewise. For
every towne, village, or hamlet hath made names to families,
as
 Darbyshire, Lancaster, (
do not looke that I should as the

Nomenclators 
in olde time marshall every name according
to his place
) Essex, Murray, Clifford, Stafford, Barkley, Leigh,
Lea, Hasting, Hamleton, Gordon, Lumley. Douglas, Booths, Clin∣ton,
Heydon, Cleydon, Hicham, Henningham, Popham, Ratcliffe,
Markham, Seaton, Framingham, Pagrave, Cotton, Cari

Whitney, Willoughby, Apseley, Crew, Kniveton, Wentworth,
Fa
shaw, Woderington, Manwood, Fetherston, Penrudock, Tre∣maine,
Trevoire, Killigrew, Roscarroc, Carminow, 
and most
families in
 Cornewall, 
of whome I have heard this Rythme:


By Tre, Ros, Pol, Lan, Caer and Pen,


You may know the most Cornish men.

Which signifie a towne, a health, a poole, a church, a castle,
or cittie, and a foreland, or promontory.



In like sort many names among the Romans were taken
from places, as 
Tarquinius, Gabinus, Volscius, Vatinius, Norba∣nus,

from 
Tarquini, Gabij, Volic
, Vatia, Norba,
 townes in 
Italie,
Sigo
ius
 and other before him have observed; and likewise

Amerinus, Carrinas, Macenas
 as 
Varre
 noteth. So 
Ruric
us,
Fonteius, Fundanus, Agellius, &c.
 Generally, all these follow∣ing
are locall names, and all which have their beginning or
termination in them, the significations whereof, for the
most parte, are commonly knowne. To the rest now vn∣knowne,
I will adioyne somwhat briefly out of

At a word, all which in English had 
Of
 set before them,
which in Cheshire and the North was contracted into 
A,
 as

Thomas a Dutton, Iohn a Standish, Adam a Kirkby,
 and all
which in La
ine old 
vi
ences have had 
De
 praefixed, as
all heeretofore sp
cified, were borrowed from places. As
those which had 
Le
 set before them, were not 
call, but gi∣ven
in other respects. As 
I
 Marshall, Le L
ner, Le De∣spencer,
Le Scroope. Le Sav
e, Le 
av
sour. Le Strange. Le
Norice, Le Fscriva
, Le Bl
d, Le Molineux, Le Bret.
 As they
also which were never noted with 
De
 or 
Le,
 in which num∣ber
I have observed, 
Gifford B
sset, Arundel, Howard, Talb
,
Bellot, Bigot, Bagot, Ta
leboise, Tale
ch, Gern
, L
vell, Lo∣vet,
Fortescu, Pancevolt, Tirell, Biund
 or 
Blunt, Bisset, Bacun,
&c.
 And these distinctions of locall names with 
De,
 and o∣ther
with 
Le,
 or simply, were religiously observed in Re∣cordes
vntill about the time of king 
Edward
 the fourth.


Neither was there, as I said before, or is there any towne,
village, hamlet, or place in 
England,
 but hath made names to
families, and so many names are locall which doe not seeme
so, because the places are vnknowne to most men, and all
knowne to no one man: as who would imagine 
Whitegift,
Powlet, Bacon, Creping, Alshop, Tirwhit, Antrobus, Heather,
Hartshorne,
 and many such like to be locall names, and yet
most certainely they are.


Many also are so changed by corruption of speach, and
altered, so strangely to significative wordes by the common
sort, who desire to make all to be significative, as they seeme
nothing lesse than locall names; as
 Wormwood, Inkepen, Tip∣tow,
Moone, Maners, Drinkewater, Cuckold, Goddolphin, Harle∣stone,
Waites, Smalbacke, Loscotte, Devill. Neithe
mill, Bellows,
Filpot, Wod
l, &c. 
for
 Ormund, Ingepen, Tiptoft, Mahune, Ma∣nors,
Derwentwater, Cuckswold, Godolchan, Hudleston. Th
ts,
Smalbach, 
scot, Davill, 
or
 D'Eivill, Nettervil, Bell-house,
Phillipot, Wahul, &c.


Neither is it to be omitted, that many locall names had

At
 prefixed before them in olde Evidences, as 
At More, A

Stow, At Ho, At Bower, At Wood, At 
owne, &c.
 which 
A
,



as it hath beene removed from some, so hath it beene con∣ioyned
to other, as 
Atwood, Atslowe, Atho, Atwell, Atmor.

As S also is ioyned to most now, as 
Mannors, Kn
les, Crofts,
Yates, Gates, Thornes, Groves, Hills, Combes, Holmes, Stokes,
&c.


Rivers also have imposed names to some men, as they
have to Townes situated on them; as that olde Ba
on 
ur-Teys,

that is, on the river 
Teys
 running betweene Yorkshire
and the Bishoppricke of 
Duresine, Derwent-water, I de
,
Troutbecke, Hartgill, Esgill, Wampull, Swale, Stoure, Temes,
Trent, Tamar, Grant, Tine, Croc, Lone, Lun, Calder, &c.
 as
some at 
Rome
 were called 
Tiberij, An
eni, Aufidij, &c,
 bicause
they were borne neere the rivers 
Tibris, Anten, Ausidus,
 as

Iulius Paris
 noteth.


Divers also had names from trees neere their habitations,
as 
Oke, Aspe, Box, Alder, El
e, Elder, Beach, Coigniers,
 that is,

Q
ince, Zouch,
 that is, the trunke of a tree, 
Cursy
 and 
Cur∣son,

the stocke of a 
Ʋine, Pine, Plumme, Chesney
 or 
Cheyney,

that is, 
Oke, Dauney,
 that is, 
Alder, Foulgiers,
 that is, 
Fearne,
Vine, Ashe, Hawthorne, Turres, Bush, Hasle, Coularay,
 that is,

Has
ewood, Bucke,
 that is, 
`Beech, Willowes, Thorne, Broome,
Blocke, &c.
 which in former time had 
at
 praefixed, as

at Beech, at Furres, at Ashe, at 
lme.
 And heere is to be no∣ted,
that diverse of this sorte have beene strangely contra∣cted,
as 
at Ashe
 into 
Tash, at Oke
 into 
Toke, at Abbey
 into

Tabbey;
 at the End into Thend; As in Saints names, Saint

Olye
 into 
Tolye,
 Saint 
Ebbe
 into Saint 
Tabbe,
 Saint 
Osyth

into Saint 
Tows.


Many strangers also comming hither, and residing here,
were named of their Countries, as 
Picard, Scot, Lombard,
Flemming, French, Bigod,
 that is, superstitious, or Norman.
(For so the Frenchmen calld the Normans, because at every
other word they would sweare,) By God; 
Bretton, Britaine,
Bret, Burgoin, Germain, Westphaling, Dane, Daneis, Man, Gas∣coigne,
Welsh, Walsh, Walleys, Irish, Cornish, Cornwallis, Faster∣ling,
Maigne, Champneis, Poitevin, Angevin. Loring,
 that is, 
de
Lotharingia, &c.
 And these had commonly 
Le
 praefixed


in Records and Writings, as 
Le Fle
ing, Le Picard, Le
Bret, &c. viz.
 the 
Flemming,
 the 
Picard.


In respect of situation to other neere places rise these v∣suall
names, 
Norrey, North▪ South, East, Weast▪
 and likewise

Northcote, Southcote, Estcote, Westcote;
 which also had ori∣ginally

At
 set before them. Yea the names of Kitchin,
Hall, Sellar, Parler, Church, Lodge &c. may seeme to have
been borrowed from the places of birth, or most frequent
abode; as among the Greekes, 
Anato
us.
 i. East 
Zephirius,

i. Weast, &c.


Whereas therefore these locall denominations of fami∣lies
are of no great antiquitie, I can not yet see why men
should thinke that their Auncestours gave names to pla∣ces,
when the places bare those very names, before anie
men did their Surnames. Yea the very terminations of
the names are such as are onely proper and appliable to
places, and not to persons in their significations, if any will
marke the Locall 
erminations which I lately specified.
Who would suppose Hil, Wood, Field, Ford, Ditch, Pole,
Pond, Towne, or Ton, and such like terminations to bee
convenient for men to beare in their n
mes, vnlesse they
could also dreame Hilles, Woods, Fieldes, Fordes, Ponds,
Pounds &c. to have beene m
tamorphosed into men by
some supernaturall transformation.


And I doubt not but they will confesse that Townes
stand longer then families continue.


It may also be prooved that many places which nowe
have Lordes denominated of them, had Lordes and ow∣ners
of other Surnames, and families not many hundred
yeeres since. But a sufficient proofe it is of anti
nt descent
where the inhabitant had his Surname of the place where
he inhabiteth, as 
Compton
 of 
Compton, Terringham
 of 
Ter∣ringham,
Egerton
 of 
Egerton, Portington
 of 
Portington, Skef∣fington

of 
Skeffington, Beeston
 of 
Beeston, &c.


I know neverthelesse, that albeit most Townes have
borrowed their names from their situation, and other re∣spectes;
yet some with apt terminations have their names


from men, as 
Edwarston, Alfredston, Vbsford, Malmesbury,

corruptly for 
Maidu
p
sbury.
 But these names were from
fore-names or Christian names, and not fro
 Surnames.
For 
Ingulphus
 plainely sheweth, that 
W
burton▪
 and 
Lef∣frington

were so named,
 because two knights, 
Wiburt,
 and

Leofric
 there sometimes inhabited. But if any should af∣firme
that the Gentlemen named 
Le
frington, Wiburton,
Lancaster,
 or 
Leicester, Bossevill,
 or 
Shordich,
 gave the
names to the places so named, I woulde humbly, without
preiudice, crave respite for a further day before I beleeved
them. And to say as I thinke, verily when they shall better
advise themselves, and marke well the terminations of
these, and such like Locall names, they will not presse me
ov
r eagrely heerein.


Notwithstanding, certaine it is that Surnames of fami∣lies
have beene adioyned to the names of places for distin∣ction,
or to notifie the owner, as 
Melton Mowbray, High∣am
Ferrers, Minster-L
vel, Stansted Rivers, Drayton-Bas∣set,
Drayton-Beauchamp, &c.
 for that they were the posses∣sions
of 
Mowbray, Ferrers, Level, &c.
 Neither do I denie,
but some among vs in former time, aswell as now, dream∣ing
of immortalitie of their names, have named their hou∣ses
after their owne names, as 
Camois-Court, Hamons,
Bretts, Bailies, Theobaldes,
 whenas now they have posses∣sors
of other names. And the olde verse is, and alwayes
will be verified of them, which a right worshipfull friend
of mine not long since writ vpon his new house:

Nunc mea, mox 
uius, sed posteà nescio cuius.


Neither must all, having their names from places, sup∣pose
that their Auncestors were either Lordes, or posses∣sors
of them; but may assure themselves, that they origi∣nally
came from them, or were borne at them. But the
Germans and Polonians doe cleare this errour by placing

In
 before the Locall names, if they are possessours of the
place, or 
Of,
 if they onelie were borne at them, as 
Marti∣nus


Cromerus
 noteth. The like also seemeth to be in vse in
the Marches of 
Scotland,
 for there you shall have 
Trotter

of 
Folshaw,
 and 
Trotter
 in 
Fogo, Haitly
 of 
Haitly,
 and 
H
∣ly

in 
Haitly.


Whereas since the time of king 
Henry
 the third the
Princes children tooke names from their natall places, as

Edward
 of 
Carnarvon, Thomas
 of 
Brotherton, Ioann
 of 
A∣cres,

dmund
 of 
Woodstocke, Iohn
 of 
Gaunt,
 who named his
children by

 u
 nothing to our purpose, to make further men∣tiō
of thē whenas they never desc
nded to their posteritie.


After this locall names, the most names in number
have beene derived from Occupations, or Professions, as
Taylor, Potter, Smith, Sadler, Arblaster, that is, 
Balistarius,

Archer, Taverner, Chauser, 
i.
 Hosier, Weaver, Pointer,
Painter, Walker, 
d est,
 Fuller in olde English, Baker, Bax∣ter,

Boulengem,
 all one in signification, Collier, Carpenter,
Ioyner, Salter, Armorer, Spicer, Grocer, Monger, 
id est,

Chapman, Brower. Brasier, Webster, Wh
eler, Wright,
Cartwright, Shipwright, Banister, 
id est, Balneator,
 Forbi∣sher,
Farrar, Goff, 
id est,
 Smyth in Welsh. And most which
end in 
Er
 in our tongue, as among the Latines, Artifice
s
names have 
arius,
 as 
lu
tcariarius, vestiarius, calcearius, &c.

or 
eo,
 or 
o
 for th
ir termi
ations, as 
Linteo, Pellio Phrygio.

Neither was there any trade, craft, arte, profession, occupa∣tion
never so meane, but had a name among vs common∣ly
ending in 
Er,
 and men accordingly denominated, but
some 
re worne out of vse, and therefore the significati∣o

vnknowne, and other have beene mollified ridiculou∣sly
by the bearers, lest they should seeme vilified by them.
And yet the like names were amōg the noblest Romans,
as 
Figul
s, Pictor, Fabritius, Scribon
s, Sal
tor, Rusticus, A∣gricola,
Carbo, 
unarius, &c.
 And who can deny but they
so named may be Gentlemen, if Virtue which is the soule
of Gentrie shall ennoble them, and 
Virtus
 (as one saieth)

Nulli pralusa est omnibus patet.
 Albeit Doctour 
Turner
 in
a Booke against 
Stephan Cardiner
 saieth the contrary, ex∣emplifying


of their owne names. At which time wise was
the man that tolde my Lord Bishop that his name was not

Gardiner,
 as the English pronounce it, but 
Gardiner
 vvith
the French accent, and therefore a Gentleman.


Hitherto may be referred many that end in 
Man,
 as,
Tubman, Carreman, Coachman, F
rriman, Clothman,
Chapman, Spelman, 
id est,
 Learned man, Palf
iman, Hors∣man,
&c.


Many have beene assumed from offices, as, 
Chambers,
Chamberlaine, Cooke, Spenser,
 that is, 
Steward, Marshall, Lati∣mer,

that is, 
Interpretour, Staller,

Reeve, Wo
dreeve, Sherif
, Sergeant, Parker,

Nourisher, Forraster,

Kempe,
 that is, Souldier in olde English; (for 
Alfricus

translateth 
T
ro, Yong-Kempe) Faulconer, Fowler, Page, But∣ler,
Clarke, Proctor, Abbot, Frier, Monke, Priest, Bishop, Spi∣gurnell,

that is, a sealer of Writs, which office was heredita∣rie
for a time to the 
Bohunes
 of 
Midherst.
 Deacon, Deane,
Bailive, Franklin, Leach, Warder, 
i.
 Keeper; & frō th
nce
Woodward, Millward, Steward, Dooreward, tha
, Por∣ter,
Beareward, Heyward, Hereward, that is, Conserver of
the armie, Bond, that is, 
Paterfamilias,
 as it is in the booke
of olde termes belonging sometimes to Saint 
Augustine

in 
Canterbury,
 and we retaine it in the compound 
Husb
nd.

In which booke also 
Horden
 is interpreted a Steward.


Names also have beene taken of honours, dignities, or
estate, as King, Duke, Prince, Lord, Baron, Knight, Valu∣asor,
or Vavasor, Squire, Castellan, partly for that their
ancestours were such, served such, acted such parts, or were
Kings of the Beane, Christmas Lords, &c. And the like
names we reade among the Greeks and Romans, as 
Basi∣
us,
Archias, Archel
, Regulus, Servius, Flaminius, Caesari∣us,
Augustulus:
 who notwithstanding were neither Kings,
Priests, Dukes, or 
Caesars.
 Others from the qualities of the
minde, as Good, Through good, Goodman, Goodchild,
Wise, Hardie, Plaine, Light, Meeke, Bold, Best, Prowd,
Sharpe, Still, Sweete, Speede, Quicke, Sure, &c. As those


old Saxon names, 
Shire,
 that is, Cleere, 
Dyre,
 that is, Wel∣beloved,

Blith,
 that is, merry, 
Drury,
 that is, jewell. Also
these French names, 
Galliard,

Musard,

Bland,
 that is, Fairespoken, 
Coigne,
 that is, Vali∣ant,

Baud,
 that is, Pleasant, 
Barrat; Kus, Rush,
 that is, Subtile,
and so is 
Prat
 in the old booke of 
Petreborrough, Huttin,

that is, Mutiner. As among the Grecians, 
Agathias, A
dra∣gathius,
Sophocles, Eubulus, Eumenius; Thraseas.
 Among
the Romans, 
Prudentius, Lepidus, Cato, `Pius, Valeus, Con∣stans,
Asper, Tacitus, Dulcitius, &c.
 And accordingly names
were borrowed, as 
Plutarch
 saieth, from the nature of the
man,
 from his actions, from some marke, forme or defor∣mitie
of his body, as 
Macrinus,
 that is, Long, 
Torquatus,

Sulla
 that is, White and Red: And in like
sort, 
Mnemon,
 that is, Mindefull, 
Grypus,

Callinicus,

des

Fane,
 that is, S
lender, 
Grim,
 that is, Strong, 
Krich,

disliked than this Greeke and Roman names, 
Ner

Romulu
; Longus, Longinus, Minut
s, Macros,
Megasthenes, Calistus, Callisthenes, Paulus, Cincinnatus, Cri∣spus,

Cocles
 one-eye. As 
Pap
rius Masonius

reporteth that 
Philippus Augustus
 King of 
France,
 was sur∣named

Borgne
 for his blinking with one eye.


Others in respect of age have received names, as Yong,
Olde, Baby, Child Stripling, as with the Romau
▪ 
Senec
,
Priscus, Iuvenalis, Iunius, Virginius, &c.



Some from the time wherein they were borne, as 
Win∣ter,
Summer, Christmas, Day, May, Sunday, Holiday, Munday,
Pascall, Noel▪ Penticost:
 as with the ancient Romans, 
Ia∣nuarius,
Martius, Manius, Lucius, F
stus,
 and 
Vergilius
 borne
at the rising of the 
Vergiliae,
 or seaven starres, as 
Pontanus

learnedly writeth against them which write his name 
Ʋir∣gilius.


Some from that which they commonly carried,
 as 
Pal∣mer,

that is, Pilgrime, for that they carried 
Palme
 when
they returned from 
Hierusalem. Long-sword, Broad-speare,
Fortescu,
 that is, Strong-shield, and in some such respect,

Breake-speare, Shake-Speare, Shotbolt, Wagstaffe, Ba∣got,

in the old Norman, the same with 
Scipio,
 that is, a stay
or walking staffe with the Latines, which became a sur∣name,
for that 
Cornelius
 served as a stay to his Blinde fa∣ther.
Likewise 
Biliman, Hookeman, Talevas,
 of a shield so cal∣led,
whereof 
William
 sonne of 
Robert de Belisme
 Earle of

Shrewsbury
 had his name.


Some from parts of the body, as
 Head, Redhead, White∣head,
Legge, Foote, Pollard, Arme, Hand, Lips, Hart, 
as
 Corcu∣lum,
Capito, Pedo, Labeo, Naso, 
among the Romans.


Garments have also occasioned names, as 
Hos, Hosatus,
Hat, Cap, Frocke, Petycote, Gaicoat:
 as with the Romans, 
Ca∣ligula,
Caracalla, Fimbria,
 and 
Hugh Capet,
 from whom this
last house of 
France
 descended, was so called, for that hee
vsed when he was young to snatch off his fellowes caps, if
we believe 
Du Tillet.


Not a few from colours of their complexions, gar∣ments,
or otherwise have gotten names, as 
White, Blacke,
Browne, Red, Greene,
 and those Norman names: 
Rous,

that is, Red, 
Blunt
 or 
Blund,
 that is, Flaxen haire, and from
these 
Russell
 and 
Blundell, Gris,
 that is, Gray, 
Pigot,
 that is,
Speckled, 
Blanch
 and 
Blanc,
 that is, White, with those Bri∣tish
or Welsh names, who whereas they were wont to
depaint themselves with sundry colours, have also bor∣rowed
many names from the said colours, as 
Gogh,
 that is,
Red, 
Gwin,
 that is, White, 
Dee,
 that is, Blacke, 
L
uid
 or



lud,
 that is, R
sset: Names to be no more disliked than

Albinus, Candidus, Flavius, Fulvius, Fusc
, 
, C
c∣c
us,
Rutilius, Rufus, Niger, Nigrinus,
 among the Roman

and 
Pyrrhus, Chlorus, Le
cagus, Chryses, 
, &c.
 a∣mong
the Graecians.


Some from flowers and fruits, as Lilly, Li
, Rose,
Peare, Nut, F
lbert, Peach, Pescod, Vetch, as faire names,
as 
Lentu
us, Pis
, Fabius,
 among the Romans. Others
from beasts, as Lambe, Lion, Boare, Beare, Bucke, Hind,
Hound, Fox, Wolph, Hare, Hog, Roc, Broc, Bad∣ger,
&c. Neither are these & such like to be disliked, when∣as
among the noblest Romans, 
Leo, Ʋrsicinus, Catulus, Lu∣pus,
Leporius, Aper, Apronius, Canimus, Cast
r, &c.
 and 
Cy∣rus,

that is, Dog, with the Persians were very vsuall.


From fishes likewise, as Playce, Salmon, Trowt, Cub,
Gurnard, Herring, Pike, Pikerill, Breme, Burt, Whiting,
Crab, Sole, Mullet, Base, &c. nothing inferiour to the Ro∣man
names, 
Murena, Phocas, Orata,
 that is, 
Gilihed, &c.
 for
that happily they loved those fishes more than other.


Many have beene derived from birds, as 
Corbet,
 that
is, Raven, 
Arondell,
 that is, Swallow: the Gentlemen of
which name, do beare those birds in their Coat-armours,

Bisset, .i.
 Dove, Larke, Tisson, Chaffinch, Nitingall, Iay-Cocke,
Peacocke, Sparrow, Swanne, Crow, Woodcocke,
Eagle, Alecocke, Wilcocke, Handecocke, Hulet or How∣let,
Wren, Gosling, Parret, Wilde goose, Finch, Kite, &c.
As good names as these, 
Corvinus, Aquilius, Milvius, Gal∣lus,
Picus, Falco, Livia, .i.
 Stockedove, &c Therefore I can∣not
but mervaile why one should so sadly mervaile such
names of beasts and birds to be in vse in 
Congo
 in 
Africa,

when they are and have beene common in other Nations,
as well as they were among the 
Troglodites
 inhabiting neere

Congo
 in former times.


Of Christian names as they have been without change,
many more have beene made, as
 Francis, Herbert, Guy,
Giles, Leonard, Michael, Lewis, Lambert, Owen, H
wel, Iosce∣lin,
Humfry, Gilbert, Griffith, Griffin, Constantine, Iames, Tho∣mas,



 Godfrey, G
rvas, Randall, Alex∣ander,
Charles, Daniel, &c.


Beside these & such like, many surnames are derived from
those Christian names which were in vse about the time of
the Conquest, & are found in the Record calld
 Doomesday

book, & else where; as
 Achard, Alan, Alpheg, Aldelme, Au∣cher,
A
sel
, A
selm, A
sger, Askaeth, Hascuith, Alberic, Ba∣got,
Baldric, Bardolph, Belchard, Berenger, Berner, Biso, Bri∣ent,
Ca

or
 C
ute, Carbonell, Chettell, Colf, Corbet
Corven, Crouch, Degory, Dod, Done, Donet, 
as it seemeth
frō
 Donatus, Dru, Duncan, Durand, Eadid, Edolph, Egenulph,
El

 or Fde, Fabian, Fulcher, Gamelin, Gernegan, Girth,
Goodwin, Godwin, Goodrich, Goodlucke, Grime, Grimbald,
Guncelin, Guthlake, Haco 
or
 Hake, Hamon, Hamelin, Har∣ding,
Hasting,
 Herebrand, 
and many ending in
 Brand, Her∣man,
Hervye Herward, Howard, Heward, Hubald, Hubert,
Huldrich, Iollan, Ioll, 
contractly from
 Iulian, Iuo, 
or
 Iue,
Kettell, Leofwin, Lewin, Levin, Liming, Macy, Maino, May∣nerd,
Meiler, Murdac, Nele, Norman, Oddo 
or

or
 Oughtred, Vde, Vivian, Voner,
Wade, Walarand, Wistan, Winoc, Walklin, Warner, Winebald,
Wigod, Wigan, Wi
arc, Woodnot, &c.


And not onely these from the Saxons and Normans,
but also many Britan or Welsh Christian names, as well
in ancient time, as lately hath been taken vp for Surnames,
when they came into 
England,
 as 
Chun, Blethin, Kenham,

frō 
Cynan
 or 
Conanus, Gittin-Mervin, Bely, Sitsil,
 or 
Cesil, Ca∣radoc,
Madoc, Rhud, Ithell, Meric, Meredith, Edern, Bedow,

from the English 
Bede, .i.
 A devout prayer, beside the
Welsh Christian names vsuall and knowne to all As in
like manner many names were made from the 
Praenomi∣na

among the Romans, as 
Spurilius, Statilius, Titius,
 from

Spurius, Statius, Titus,
 And as 
Qu
itilian
 saieth, 
Agnom



& cognomina 
.


By contracting or rather corrupting of Christian names,
we have 
Terry
 from 
Theodorie,
 
Frerry
 from 
Frederic, Col∣lin

and 
Cole
 from 
Nicholas, Tebald
 from 
Theobald, Iessop,

from 
Ioseph, Aubry,
 from 
Alberic, Amery,
 from 
Almeric,
Garret,
 from 
Gerrard, Nele,
 from 
Nigel, Elis,
 from 
Elias,
Bets,
 from 
Beatus,
 as 
Bennet,
 from 
Benedict, &c.


By addition of
 S 
to Christian names, many have beene
taken, as
 Williams, Rogers, Peters, Peirs, Davies, Harris,
Roberts, Simonds, Guyes, Stevens, Richards, Hughes, Iones,
&c.


From Nicknames or Nursenames, came these (pardon
me if it offend any, for it is but my coniecture,)
 Bill 
for

William, Clem 
for
 Clement, Nat 
for
 Nathaniel, Mab 
for
 A∣braham,
Kit 
for
 Christopher, Mund 
for
 Edmund, Hall 
for

Harry, At 
and
 Atty 
for

for
 Barthobnewe, Law 
for
 Lawrence, 
 
for

Timothy, Rol 
for
 Rolland, Ieff 
for
 Ieffrey, Dun 
for
 Duncan 
or

Dunstan, Duke 
for
 Marmaduke, Daye 
for
 David, God. 
For

Godfrey 
or
 Godard, 
for otherwise I cannot imagine how
that most holy name vnfit for a man, and not to be tolera∣ted,
should be appropriate to any man: and many such like
which you may learne of Nurses.


By adding of
 S 
to these Nicknames or Nursenames,
in all probabilitie we have
 Robins, Nicks, Nicolls, Tho
s,
Dickes, Hickes, Wills, Sims, Sams, Iecks, Iucks, Collins, Ienks,
Munds, Hodges, Hobs, Dobi, Saunders 
from
 Alexander, Gibs

from
 Gilbert, Cuts 
from
 Cuthberd, Bats 
from
 Barthol
we
Wats 
from
 Walter, Philips 
from
 Philip, Hai
es 
from
 Anul∣phus,

as some will, for
 Ainulphesbury 
in Cambridgshire is
contracted to
 Aiusbury, 
and such like.


Many likewise have beene made by adioyning 
Ki

and 
Ius
 to those nursenames, making them in 
Ki
s
 as it


were diminutives, & those in 
Ius,
 as 
Patronymica.
 For so 
Al∣fric

Archbishop of 
Canterbury,
 & the most ancient Saxon
Grammarian of our Nation, noteth that names taken
from Progenitours, do end in 
Ins;
 so 
Dickins,
 that is, little

Dick, Perkins
 from 
Peir
 or 
Peter,
 little 
Petre;
 so 
Tomkins, Wil∣kins,
Hutchins, Huggins, Higgins, Hitchins;
 from 
Hughe,
Lambkins, Hopkins, Hobkins;
 from 
Hob, Dobbin
, Robbins,
Atkins;
 from 
Arthur, Gibbins, Simkins, Hodgekins, Hoskins,
Watkins, Ienkins, Iennings, Tipkins;
 from 
Tibald, Daukins;

from 
Davy, Rawlins
 from 
Ra
ul,
 that is, 
Rafe,
 and 
Hankin

for 
Rand
ll
 in Cheshire. In this manner did the Romans
very names, as 
Constans, Constantius, Constantinus; Iustus,
Iustulus, Iustinus, Iustinianus: Aurelius, Aureolus, Aurelianus,
Augustus, Augustinus, Augustinianus, Augustulus, &c,


Beside these, there are also other diminitive names af∣ter
the French 
Analogie
 in 
Et
 or 
Ot,
 as 
Willet;
 from 
Will,
Haket;
 from 
Hake, Bartlet;
 from 
Bartholmew, Millet
 from

Miles, Huet
 from 
Hughe, Allet
 from 
Allan, Collet
 from

Cole, Guyet
 from 
Guy, Eliot
 from 
Elias
 and 
Beckvet,
 that is,
Little Sharpe nose.


But many more by addition of
 Son, 
to the Christian
or Nickname of the father, as
 Williamson, Richardson, Dick∣son,
Harryson, Gibson; 
for
 Gilbertson, Simson, Simondson, Ste∣venson,
Dauson; 
for
 Davison, Morison, Lawson, id est, Law∣renson,
Robinson, Cutbertson, Nicholson, Tomson, Willson, Lew∣eson,
Iobson, Waterson, Watson, Peerson, 
and
 Pierson, Peterson,
Ha
son 
from
 Hankin, Wilkinson, Danison 
for
 Daniel, Be∣nison,

and
 Benson 
from
 Bennet, Denison, Patison; 
from
 Pa∣trick,
Ienkinson, Matison; 
from
 Mathew, Colson; 
from
 Cole,

or
 Nicholl, Rogerson, Herdson; 
from
 Herdingson, Hodgskinson,
Hugheson, Hulson; 
from
 Huldric, Hodson 
from
 Hod 
or
 Odd
,
Nelson 
from
 Neale 
or
 Nigell, Davidson, Saunderson, Iohn∣son,
Raulson; 
from
 Raoul 
or
 Ralf. 
So the ancient Romans
vsed
 Publipor, Marcip
r, Lucipor; 
for
 Publij puer, Marci puer,
Lucij puer, 
according to
 Varro: 
As afterwards in the
 Capi∣tolin

Tables, they were wont to note both father and
grandfather for proofe of their gentry in abbreviations,


as
 A. Sempronius, Aulifilius Lucij Nep
s, 
that is,
 
 Se
∣pronius,

sonne of
 Aulus, 
grandchild or nephew of
 Lucius,
C. Martius, L. F. C. N. &c. 
Neither is it true which
some say,
 Omnia nomina in 
Son
 sunt boralis generis, 
whenas
it was vsuall in every part of the Realme.


Some also have had names from their mothers, as 
Fitz-parnell,
Fitz-Isabell, Fitz-Mary, Fitz-Emme, Mandle
s,
Susans, Mawds, Grace, Emson, &c.
 As 
Vespasian
 the Empe∣rour,
from 
Vespasia Polla
 his mother, and 
Popaea Sabina
 the
Empresse, from her grandmother.


In the same sence it continueth yet in them which
descended from the Normans, 
Fitz-Hughe, Fitz-william,
Fitz-Herbert, Fitz-Geffrey, Fitz-Simon, Fitz-Alian, Fitz-Owen,
Fitz-Randoll,
 being names taken from their Pro∣genitours,
as among the Irish, 
Mac-william, Mac-Cone,
Mac-Dermot, Mac-Mahon, Mac-Donell, Mac-Arti, .i.
 the
sonne of 
Arthur.


So among the Welsh-Britans likewise,
 Ap-Robert, Ap-Evans,
Ab-Yihel, Ap-Hary, Ap-Hughe, Ap-Rice, Ap-Richard,
Ap-Howell, Ap-Enion, Ap-Owen, Ap-Henry, Ap-Rhud,

which be contracted into
 Probert, Bevans, Bythell,
Parry, Pughe, Price, Prichard, Powell, Benion, B
wen, Peurbye,
Prud, &c.


So in the borders of 
England
 and 
Scotland, Gawis I
k,

for 
Iohn
 the sonne of 
Gawin, Richies Edward,
 for 
Edward

the sonne of 
Richard, Iony Riches Will,
 for 
William
 the
sonne of 
Iohn,
 sonne of 
Richard.
 The like I have heard to
be in vse among the meaner sort in 
Cornwall.


Daintie was the devise of my Host at 
Grantham,
 which
would wisely make a difference of degrees in persons, by
the terminations of names in this word 
Son,
 as betweene

Robertson, Robinson, Robson, Hobson; Richardson, Dickson,
 and

Dickinson; Willson, Williamson,
 and 
Wilkinson, Iackson, Iohn∣son,
Ienkinson,
 as though the one were more worshipful than
the other by his degrees of comparison.


The names of aliance, have also continued in some for
surnames, as where they of one family being of the same


Christian name, were for distinction called 
R. Le Frere, Le
Fitz, Le Cosm,
 that is, Brother, the Sonne, &c. all which pas∣sed
in time into Surnames.


Many names also given in merriment for By-names or
Nicke-names have continued to posteritie: as 
Malduit
 for
ill schollership, or ill taught, 
Mallieure
 commonly 
Mally∣very,

i. 
Malus Leporarins,
 for ill hunting the hare, 
Pater no∣ster

for devout praying. The Frenchman, which craftily,
and cleanely conveyed himselfe and his prisoner, 
T: Crioll

a great Lord in 
Rent,
 about the time of King 
Edward
 the
second out of 
Fraunce,
 and had therefore 
Swinfield
 given
him by 
Crioll,
 as I have read, for his fine conveyance, was
then called 
Fineux,
 and left that name to his posteritie. So

Baldwin le-Pettour,
 who had his name, and held his land
in 
Suffolke, Per saltum, sufflum & pettum, sive bumbulum,
 for
dauncing, pout-puffing, and dooing that before the King
of 
England
 in Christmasse holy dayes, which the worde

Pet
 signifieth in French. Inquire if you vnderstand it not
of 
Cloacinas
 chaplaines, or such as are well read in 
A
ax.


Vpon such like occasions names were given among the
Romans,
 as 
Tremellius
 was called 
Scropha
 or Sow, because
when he had hid his neighbours Sow vnder a padde, and
commanded his wife to lie dovvne thereon; he sware when
the owner came in to seeke the Sow, that hee had no Sow
but the great Sow that lay there, poynting to the padde,
and the Sow his vvife. So one 
Cornelius
 was surnamed 
A∣sina,

for that when he was to put in assurance for payment
of certaine summes in a purchase, hee brought his Asse la∣den
with money, and made ready payment. So 
Augustus

named his dwarfe 
Sarmentum,
 i. sprigge, and 
Tiberius
 cal∣led
one 
Tricongius,
 for carowsing three gallons of wine. So

Servilius
 was called 
Ala,
 for carrying his dagger vnder his
arme-pit, vvhen hee killed 
Spurius.
 So 
Pertinax
 the Em∣peror
being stubbernly resolute in his youth to be a wood
monger as his father vvas,
 vvhen hee vvoulde have made
him a Scholler, vvas named 
Pertinax.
 So the father of 
Va∣lens

the Emperour, who was Camp-maister heere in 
Bri∣taine,



for his fast holding a rope in his youth, vvhich 

souldiers could not plucke from him, vvas called 
.

About vvhich time also 
Paul
 a Spaniard, a common In∣former
in 
Britaine
 vvas named 
Catena,
 i. the Chaine, for
that he chained and fettered many good men heere, vvith
linking together false surmises, to their vtter vndooing in
the time of 
Constantinus,
 who also that I may remember it
in passage, named his attendant scholler by no vnfitting
name, 
Musonius.
 But what names the beastly monster, ra∣ther
than Emperour 
Commmodus
 gave to his attendants, I
dare not mention, lest I should be immodestly offensive to
chaste eares, and modest mindes. But hitherto with mo∣desty
may be referred this of the familie of 
Gephyri,
 i. 
Brid∣ges

in 
Greece,
 who tooke their name from a Bridge; for
vvhen their mother was delivered of nine children at a
birth, and in a foolish feare had privily sent seven of them
to be drowned at a bridge, the father sodainely comming
to the bridge, saved them, and thereupon gave them that
name. Of these, and the like, we may say, 
Propi
ra sunt ho∣nori,
quàm ignominiae.
 Infinite are the occasions which in
like manner have made names to persons, I will onely re∣porte
one or two French examples, that thereby you may
imagine of others in other places and former ages.


In the first broyles of 
Fraunce,
 certaine companies ran∣ging
themselves into troupes, one Captaine tooke newe
names to himselfe and his company from the furniture of
an horse. Among these new named gallants, you might
have heard of, 
Monsieur Saddle,
 (to english them) 
Moun∣sieur
Bridle, Le Croupier, Le Girte, Horsh
, Bitte, Trappiers,
Hoofe, Stirrope, Curbe, Musrole, Frontstall, &c.
 Most of the
which had their pasport, as my Author noteth, by 
Seign

de la Halter.
 Another Captaine there also gave names to
his, according to the places where he found thē, as 
Hodge,
Hieway, River, Pond, Vine, Stable, Street, Corner, Gall
ws, Ta∣verne,
Tree, &c.
 And I have heard of a consort in 
England,

who when they had served at Sea, tooke names from the
equipage of a shippe, when they would serve themselves


at land, as, 
, Ball
st, Planke, F
re-decke, Decke, Loope∣hole,
Pumpe, Rudder, Gable, Anchor, Misen saile, Capson,
Maste, Bolt..
 So that is true which 
Isidore
 saieth, 
Names are
not alwayes given according to Nature, but some after our
owne will and pleasure, as we name our landes and servants ac∣cording
to our owne liking.
 And the Dutchmans saying may
be verified, which when he heard of, Englishmen called
God and Divell, saide, that the English borrowed names
from all things whatsoever, good or bad.


It might be heere questioned, whether these surnames
were assumed and taken at the first by the persons them∣selves,
or imposed and given vnto them by others. It may
aswell seeme that the locall names of persons were partely
taken vp by themselves, if they were owners of the place,
as given by the people, who have the soveraignty of words
and names, as they did in the Nicke-names before Sur∣names
were in vse. For who would have named himselfe,
Peaceable, Vnready, Without-land, Beauclerke, Strong∣bow,
Gagtooth, Blanch-mayne, Bossue, i. Crook-backe,
but the concurrent voyce of the people, as the women
neighbours gave the name to 
Obed
 in the booke of 
Ruth;

and likewise in Surnames. In these pretty names, as I may
terme them, from floures, fishes, birdes, habitudes, &c: it
may bee thought that they came from Nurses in former
times heere, as very many, or rather most in 
Ireland
 and

Wales
 doe at this present. These Nicke-names of one sil∣lable
turned to surnames, as 
Dickes, Nickes, Toms, Hobbes,
&c.
 may also seeme to proceed from Nurses, to their Nur∣slings;
or from fathers and maisters to their boyes and ser∣vants.
For, as according to the old proverb, 
Omnis herus
serv
 Monosyllabus,
 in respect of their short commands: so

Omnis servus har
 Monosyllabus
 in respect of the curtolling
their names, as 
Wil, Sim, Hodge, &c.
 Neither is it improba∣ble,
but that many names that seeme vnfitting for men, as
of brutish beasts, &c. came frō the very signes of the hou∣ses
where they inhabited; for I have heard of them which
said they spake of knowledge, that some in late time dwel∣ling


at the signe of the Dolphin, Dull, White-horse, 
∣ket,
Peacocke, &c. were commonly called 
 at the

Dolphin, Will
 at the 
Bull, George
 at the 
White horse, Robin

at the 
Racket,
 which names as many other of like sort, with
omitting 
At,
 became afterward herod
ta
le to their children.


Heereby some insight may bee had in the originall of
Surnames, yet it is a matter of great difficultie, to being
them all to certain heads, whenas our language is so great∣ly
altered, so many new names daily brought in by Aliens,
as French, Scots, Irish, Welch, Dutch, &c. and so many old
words worne out of vse. I meane not only in the old En∣glish,
but also the late Norman, for who knoweth nowe
what these names were, 
Giffard, Basset, Gernon, Mallet, Ho∣ward,
Peverell, Paganell,
 or 
Paynell, Taile boise, Talb
t, L
vet,
Panc
volt, Tirrell, &c.
 which are nothing lesse than locall,
and certainely significative, for they are never noted, as I
said before in olde evidences with 
De
 as locall names, 

alwayes absolutely, as 
W. Giffard, R. Basset,
 as Christian
names are, when they are made Surnames; and yet I will
not affirme, that all these heere mentioned were at anie
time Christian names, although doubtlesse some were.


For wee knowe the significations of some of them, as

Mallet,
 an Hammer, 
Bigot,
 a Norman, or superstitious

Tailebois.
 i. 
Cutwood, Lovet,
 Little Woolfe, and 
Basset,
 (as
some thinke) Fatte; 
Giffard
 is by some interpreted Libe∣rall;
and 
Howard,
 High Warden, or Guardian (as it seem∣eth
an office now out of vs
) whenas 
Heobeorg
 signified in
olde English High defence, and 
He
h-faeder,
 Patriarch or
High father. Certaine it is, that the first of that right no∣ble
family who was knowne by the name of 
H
ward,
 was
the sonne of 
William de Wigenhall,
 as the honourable Lord

William Howard
 of 
Naworth,
 third sonne to 
Thomas
 late
Duke of 
Norffolke,
 an especial searcher of Antiquities, who
equalleth his high parentage with his vertues, hath lately
discovered.


To find out the true originall of Surnames,
 is full of dif∣ficulty,
so it is not easie to search all the causes of alterati∣ons


of Surnames, which in former ages have beene verie
common among vs, and have so intricated, or rather, ob∣scured
the trueth of our Pedegrees, that it will be no little
hard labour to deduce many of them truly from the Con∣quest;
Somewhat neverthelesse shall be said thereof, but
more shall be left for them which will sound deeper into
this matter.


To speake of alteration of names, omitting them of

Abraham,
 and 
Sara, Iacob,
 and 
Israel,
 in holy Scriptures,
I have observed that the change of names, hath most com∣monly
proceeded from a desire to avoyd the opinion of
basenes.
 So 
C
d
marus
 when he succeeded 
Ochus
 in the
kingdome of 
Persia,
 called himselfe by the princely name

Darius.
 So new names were given to them which were
deified by the Paganish consecration, as 
Romulus
 was cal∣led

Quirmus, Melicertus
 was called 
Portunus,
 and 
Palaemon,

Likewise in adoptions into better families and testament,
as the sonne of 
L. Aemilius,
 adopted by 
Scipio,
 tooke the
name of 
Scipio Africanus.
 So 
Augustus
 who was first na∣med

Thureon,
 tooke the name of 
Octavian
 by testament:
by enfranchising also into new Citties, as he which first
was called 
Lucumo,
 when he was infranchised at 
Rome,

tooke the name of 
Lucius Tarquinius Priscus.
 So 
Deme∣trius
Mega
 when he was there made free of the Citty, was
called 
Publius Cornelius. Cicero Epist. 36. lib.
 13.


Likewise slaves when they were manumised, tooke
often their masters names, whenas they had but one name
in their servile state. As they which have read 
Artemidorus,

do know, how a slave, who when he dreamed he had 
tria
virilia,
 was made free the next morning, and had three
names given him.


Neither is it to be forgotten, that men were not forbid∣den
to change name or surname, by the rescript of 
Diocle∣sian
L. Vinc. c. de mutat. nom.
 so be that it were 
Sine aliqua
fraude, iure licito.
 As that great Philosopher which was
first called 
Malchus
 in the 
Syrian
 tongue, tooke the name
of 
Porphyrius,
 as 
Eunapius
 reporteth: as before 
Suetonius



the Historian looke to surname 
, whenas his fa∣ther
was 
Suetonius L
uis.
 Those notvvithstanding of
strange base parentage were forbidden 
L. super 
 c. de
quaest.
 to insert, or inthrust themselves into noble and ho∣nest
families by changing their names, which will growe
to inconvenience in 
England,
 as it is thought, by reason that
Surnames of honourable and worshipfull families are gi∣ven
now to meane mens children for Christian names,
as it is growen nowe in 
Fraunce,
 to the confusion of their
Gentry, by taking new names from their purchased landes
at their pleasures.
 Among the Romans nevertheles they
that were called 
ad Equestrem ordinem,
 having base names,
were new named 
nomine ingenuorum veterum{que} Romano∣rum,

lest the name should disgrace the dignitie,
 when ac∣cording
to 
Plato,
 comely things should have no vncomely
names.


It was vsuall amongest the Christians in the Primitive
church, to change at Baptisme the names of 
Catechu
e
i,

which were in yeeres, as that impious 
Renegado,
 that was
before called 
Lucius,
 was in his Baptisme called 
Lucianus.

So the Popes vse to change their names, when they enter
into the Papaci
, which as 
Plati
a
 saith, was begunne by
Pope 
Sergius
 the second, who first changed his name, for
that his former name was 
Hogges-mouth,
 but other referre
the change of names in Popes to Christ, who changed 
Si∣mon

into 
Peter, Iohn
 and 
Iames
 into 
Bonarges:
 Onely 
Mar∣cellus,

not long since chosen Pope, refused to chaunge his
name, saying, 
Marcellus
 I was, and 
Marcellus
 I will be, I
will neither change Name nor Manners. Other religious
men also when they entred into some Orders, chaunged
their name 
n times past, follovving therein, (as they re∣port)
the Apostle, that chaunged his name from 
Saule
 to

Paule,
 after he entred into the Ministery, borrovving (as
some say) that name from 
Sergius Paulus
 the Roman liev∣tenant,

but as other will from his lovve stature, for hee was
but three cubites high, as Saint 
Chrysostome
 speaking of
him. 
Tricubitalis ille tamen coelum ascendit.



Of changing also Christian names in Confirmation we
have saide before; but overpassing these forraine matters
let vs say somewhat as concerning chaunge of names in

England.


As among the French in former time, and also nowe,
the heire tooke the fathers surname, and the yonger sonnes
tooke names of their landes allotted vnto them. So like∣wise
in times past did they in 
England;
 and the most com∣mon
alteration proceeded from place of habitation. As if

Hugh
 of 
Suddington
 gave to his second sonne his Mannour
of 
Frydon,
 to his third sonne his Mannour of 
Pantley,
 to
his fourth his Wood of 
Albdy;
 the sonnes calld thems
lves

De Frydon, De Pantley, De Albdy;
 and their posteritie remo∣ved

De.
 So 
Hugh Montfortes
 second sonne called 
Richard

being Lord of 
Hatton
 in 
Warwickeshire
 tooke the name of

Hatton.
 So the yongest sonne of 
Simon de Montfort
 Earle of

Leicester
 staying in 
England,
 when his father was slaine, and
brethren fled, tooke the name of 
Welsborne,
 as some of that
name have reported. So the name of 
Ever
 came from the
Mannour of 
Ever,
 neere 
Vxbridge,
 to yonger sonnes of L.

Iohn Fitz-Robert de Clavering,
 from whom the Lorde 
E∣vers,

and sir 
Peter Evers
 of 
Axholme
 are descended So sir

Iohn Cradocke
 knight great grandfather of sir 
Henry New∣ton

of 
Somersetshire
 tooke first the name of 
Newton,
 which
was the name of his habitation: as the issue of 
Huddard
 in

Cheshire
 tooke the name of 
Dutton.


Bnt for varietie and alteration of names in one familie
vpon divers respects, I will give you one 
Cheshire
 exam∣ple
for all, out of an antient roule belonging to sir 
William
Brerton
 of 
Brerton
 knight, which I sawe twenty yeares
since. Not long after the Conquest 
William Bellward
 lord
of the moietie of 
Malpasse,
 had two sonnes, 
Dan-David
 of

Malpasse,
 surnamed 
Le Clerke,
 and 
Richard; Dan-David

had 
William
 his eldest sonne surnamed 
De Malpasse,
 from
whom the Baron 
Dudley
 is descended by heire generall.
His second sonne was named 
Philip Gogh,
 one of the issue
of whose eldest sonnes tooke the name of 
Egerton;
 a third


sonne tooke the name of 
David 
,
 and one of his
sonnes the name of 
Goodm
. Richard
 the other sonne of
the aforesaid 
William Belward
 had three sonnes, who tooke
also divers names, 
viz. Thomas de C
tgrave, William de O∣verton,

and 
Richard Little,
 who had two sonnes, the one
named 
Ken-clarke,
 and the other 
Iohn Richardson.
 Heerein
you may note alteration of names in respect of habitation
in 
Egerton, Cotgrave, Overton,
 in respect of colour in 
G
g
,

that is, Red, in respect of qualitie in him that was called

Goodm
n,
 in respect of stature in 
Richard Little,
 in respect
of learning in 
Ken-clarke,
 in respect of the fathers Christi∣an
name in 
Richardson,
 all descending from 
William Bell∣ward.

And verily the Gentlemen of those so different
names in 
Cheshire
 would not easily be induced to beleeve
they were descended from one house, if it were not war∣ranted
by so antient a proofe.


In respect of stature I could recite to you other exam∣ples,
but I will onely adde this which I have read, that a
yong Gentleman of the house of 
Preux,
 being of tall sta∣ture
attending on the Lord 
Hungerford,
 Lord Treasourer
of 
England,
 was among his fellowes called Long 
H:
 who
after preferred to a good marriage by his Lorde, was called

H. Long,
 that name continued to his posteritie, knights and
men of great worship.


Other took their mothers surnames, as 
A. Audley
 yon∣ger
brother to 
Iames
 lord 
Audley,
 marrying the daughter
and heire of 
H. de Stanley
 left a sonne 
William,
 that tooke
the name of 
Stanley,
 from whome 
Stanley
 Earle of 
Derby,

aud other of that name are descended. 
Geffrey
 the sonne of

Robert Fitz-Maldred,
 and 
Isabel
 his wife, heire of the Nor∣man
house of the 
Nevilles,
 tooke the name of 
Nevill,
 and
left it to his posteritie which was spread into very manie
honourable families of 
England.
 In like manner the sonne
of 
Ioscelin
 of 
Lovan
 a yoonger sonne to the Duke of 
Bra∣bant,

when he had married 
Agnes
 the onely daughter of

William
 Lord 
Percy
 so named of 
Percy
 forrest in the coun∣ty
of 
Maen,
 from whome they came, (and not of piercing


the king of 
S
ts
 through the 
, as 
H
ct
r B
tius
 fableth)
his sonne and posteritie vppon a composition with the
same Lady, tooke her name of 
Percy,
 but retained theyr
olde coate armour, to shew from whome they descended;
So 
Adam de Montgomery
 marrying the daughter and heire
of 
Carew
 of 
Molesford,
 her sonne relinquishing his owne,
left to his posteritie his mothers name 
Carew,
 from whom
the Barons 
Carew,
 the 
Carews
 of 
Haccomb,
 of 
Berry,
 of 
Au∣thony,
Beddington, &c.
 have had their names and originall.
Likewise 
Ralph Gernon
 marrying the daughter of 
Caven∣dish,

or 
Candish,
 left that name to his issue, as 
Th: Talbot,

a learned Genealogist hath prooved. So 
Robert Meg
 the
great favourite of king 
Iohn
 took the name of 
Braybrooke,

whereof his mother was one of the heires. So sir 
Iohn de
Haudlow
 marrying the daughter and heire of the Lorde

Burnell,
 his posteritie tooke the name of 
Burnell.
 So sir

Tibauld Russell
 tooke the name of 
De Gorges
 to him and
his issue, for that his mother was sister and one of the heirs
of 
Ralfe de Gorges,
 as it appeareth in the controversie be∣tweene

Warbleton
 and the saide 
Tibauld de Corges
 for the
coate of Armes 
Lozengy, Or,
 and 
Azure,
 21. of 
Edward

the third, before 
Henry
 Earle of 
Lancaster,
 and others, at
the siege of Saint 
Margaret.
 Not many years since, when

Iames H
rsey
 had married the daughter of 
De-Le-vale
 of

Northumberland,
 his issue tooke the name of 
De-la-vale.


Heerevnto may they also bee referred who changed
their names in remembrance of their Progenitours being
more honourable, as the sonnes of 
Geffrey Fitz-Petre,

tooke the name of 
Magnavilla
 or 
Mandevile,
 when they
came to be Earles of 
Essex,
 because their grandmother 
Be∣atrix

was of the house of 
Mandevile,
 as appeareth by the
Abby booke of 
Walden.
 So 
Thomas de Molton
 tooke the
name of 
Lucy,
 and many other, which I omit.


Others also have taken the name of them whose lands
they had: As when King 
Henry
 the first gave the lands of
the attainted 
Robert Moubray
 Earle of 
Northumberland,

being 120. Knights fees in 
Normandy,
 and 140. in 
Eng∣land,



to 
Nigall
 or 
N
le de
 
 who in
the battell at 
,
 tooke 
Robert
 Duke of 

prisoner: he commanded withall, that his posteritie
should take the Surname of 
Mo
bray,
 which they accor∣dingly
did, and retained the same as long as the issue male
continued, which determined in 
Iohn Mo
bray
 Duke of

Norfolke,
 in the time of King 
Edward
 the fourth: whose
heires were married into the families of 
Howard
 and

Barkeley.


Remembrance of benefits made others to change their
names, as 
William Mortimer
 descended from those of 
Ri∣chards

Castle, tooke the name of 
La-Zouch,
 and named
his sonne 
Alan de la-Zouch,
 for some favour received from
the Lord 
Zouch
 of 
Ashby de la-Zouch,
 as appeareth by 
In∣quisition.

11. & 21. 
Ed.
 3.


In respect of adoption also, very many in all ages have
changed their names: I neede not particulate it, for all know
it. Some of their owne dislike of their names, have alte∣red
them: for as I have read in the booke of 
Fornesse, Wil∣liam
Fitz-Gilbert
 Baron of 
Kendall,
 obtained licence of
King 
Henry
 the second, to change his name and call him∣selfe
and his posteritie 
Lancaster,
 from whom the 
Lanca∣sters

in 
Westm
rlaud &c.
 are descended.


Heerevpon some thinke that without the Kings li∣cence
new names cannot be taken, or old names given a∣way
to others. Yet 
Tiraquell
 the great 
Civilian
 of 
France, in
Leg. quin. Conub. Tit.
 92. seemeth to incline, that both name
and Armes may be transferred by will and testament, and
produceth 
Augustus,
 who by his Testament commanded

Tiberius
 and 
Livia
 to beare his name. How in former times

Herevile,
 
Dunvile, Clauwowe,
 gave and granted away their
Armes, which are as silent names, distinctions of families;
and the same was thought vnlawfull afterward, when the
Lord 
 would have done the same, shall be declared in
more convenient place. But the inconvenience of change
of names, hath beene discovered to be such in 
France,
 that
it hath beene pr
pounded in 
 at 
,
 that it


should not be permitted but in these two respects, eyther
when one should bee made heire to any with especiall
words, to assume the name of the testatour; or when any
one should have a donation surmounting a thousand
crownes, vpon the same condition. But to retyre to our
purpose.


Not a few have assumed the names of their fathers
Baronies, as in former times the issue of 
Richard Fitz-Gil∣bert,

tooke the name of 
Clare,
 which was their Barony: and
in late time, since the 
Suttons
 came to the Barony of 
Dud∣ley,

all their issue tooke the name of 
Dudleyes:
 that I may
omit others. The dislike of others hath caused also a
change of names, for King 
Edward
 the first, disliking the
iteration of 
Fitz,
 commanded the Lord 
Iohn Fitz-Robert,

a most ancient Baron,
 (whose Ancestours had continued
their Surnames by their fathers Christian names,) to leave
that manner, and to be called 
Iohn Clavering,
 which was
the capitall seate of his Barony. And in this time, many that
had followed that course of naming by 
Fitz,
 tooke them
one setled name, and retained it as 
Fitz Walter,
 and others.


Also at that time the names of 
Thomson, Richardson,
Willson,
 and other of that forme began to be setled, which
before had varied according to the name of the father. 
Ed∣ward

the fourth likewise (as I have heard,) loving some
whose name was 
Picard,
 would often tell them that hee
loved them well, but not their names, wherevpon some of
them changed their names: and I have heard that one of
them which tooke the name of 
Ruddle,
 being the place of
his birth in that respect. And in late yeares in the time of
King 
Henry
 the eight, an ancient worshipfull gentleman
of 
Wales,
 being called at the panniell of Iury by the name
of 
Thomas Ap William, Ap Thomas, Ap Richard, Ap Hoel,
Ap Evan Ʋaghan, &c.
 was advised by the Iudge to leave
that old manner. Wherevpon he after called himselfe 
Mo∣ston,

according to the name of his principall house, and left
that Surname to his posterity.


Offices have brought new names to divers families, as


when 
Edward Fitz-Th
bald,
 of 
Ireland,

the Earles of 
Ormond
 and others descended from them,
tooke the name of 
Butler.
 So the distinct families of the

Constables
 in the County of 
Yorke,
 are saide to have ta∣ken
that name, from some of their Ancestours which bare
the office of Constables of some Castles. In Like manner
the 
Stewards, Marshalls, Spencers.
 That I may say nothing
of such as for well acting on the stage, have carried away
the names of the personages which they acted, and have
lost their owne names among the people.


Schollers pride hath wrought alteration in some names
which have beene sweetned in sound, by drawing 
hem to
the Latine 
Analog
.
 As that notable Non-resident in our
fathers time Doctor 
Magnus,
 who being a foundling at

Newark
 vppon 
Trent,
 where hee erected a Grammer
schoole, was called by the people 
T. Among vs,
 for that he
was found among them: But he profiting in learning, tur∣ned

Among vs,
 into 
Magnus,
 and was famous by that name,
not onely heere, but also in forraine places where he was
often Ambassadour.


It were needelesse to note heere againe, how many
have taken in former times the Christian name of their
father, with prefixing of 
Fitz
 or 
Filz,
 as 
Fitz-bugh, Fitz-alan,
Fitz-william,
 or adding of 
Son,
 as 
Richardson, Tomson,
Iohnson, &c.
 and so altered their Surnames if they had any.
Whereas divers ancient Gentlemen of 
England
 do beare
Coates of Armes, which by old roules and good proofes
are knowne to belong to other names and families, and
cannot make proofe that they matched with those fami∣lies,
it is worth observation, considering how religious
they were in elder times in keeping their owne Armes:
whether they were not of those ancient houses whose
Armes they beare, and have changed their names in re∣spect
of their habitation, or partitions and lands gotten by
their wives. As 
Pickering
 of the North, beareth Ermin a
Lion rampant Azure crowned, Or, which, as it is in the
old Abby booke of 
Furnesse,
 was the coat of 
Roger de Miy∣th
rp.



In the same booke the coate of 
Dacr
, Gules 3. Esca∣l
pes
Arg.
 is the coate of 
R. Ger
th
 of 
Cumberland,
 and so
the three pillowes Ermin of 
Redman
 of 
Northumberland,
 is
the coate of 
Ran. de Greystock.
 So 
Ʋfford
 E. of 
Suffolk,
 and

Peit
n, Fetiplace,
 and 
Hide,
 and many other Gentlemen of
the same Armes, may seeme to haue beene of the same
stocke, and to haue varied their names in diuers respects.


Finally, among the common people which sway all in
names, many Surnames haue bene changed in respect of
occupations, and not a few have beene changed in respect
of masters, for in every place we see the youth very com∣monly
called by the names of their ocupations, as 
Iohn
 Ba∣ker,

Thomas
 Taylor, 
Will
 Butcher, 
Dic
 Barber, and many
by their masters names, as 
Iohn Pickering, Thomas Watkins,
Nicholas French,
 whenas they served maisters of those
names, which often were conveyed to their posteritie, and
their owne Surnames altogether forgotten. Some other
causes of alteration of names may be found, as for crimes
committed when men have beene enforced to leave their
countries. But heereby it may be vnderstood that an 
Alias

or double name cannot preiudice the honest: and it is
knowne that when Iudge 
Catiline
 tooke exception at one
in this respect, saying, that no honest man had a double
name, & came in with an 
Alias.
 The party asked him what
exception his Lordship could take to Iesus Christ, Alias,
Iesus of 
Nazareth.


I doubt not but some men among vs in changing their
names, do imitate olde Goffer 
Simon
 the Cobbler in 
Lu∣cian,

who when he grew fat in the purse, would needes be
called for Goodman 
Si
on.
 Master 
Simonides,
 as some wo∣men
do follow the good Greeke wench, 
Melissarton,
 that
is, Pretty honny-Bee, who when of a Commediant shee
became a wealthy mans wife,
 would be saluted Madam

Pithias,
 or 
Prudence.
 And some likewise can change them∣selves
from shee, to hee, and consequeetly their name, as

Cenis
 the wench, into 
Ceneus
 the yong man, as you may
see in 
Ovid.



Among the alteration of 

how Kings of Armes, 
, and 
 are
new named with a bole of wine powred vpon their heads
by the Prince or Earle Marshall, when they are invested,
and the Kings crowned, as 
Garter, Clerenceux, N
rrey: L
∣caster,
Yorke, Richmond, Somerset, &c.
 which is as ancient
as the time of King 
Edward
 the third. For we reade, that
when newes was brought him at 
Windsor,
 by a Pursuvant,
of the victory at the battell of 
Auroy,
 hee bountifully re∣warded
him, and immediately created him Herold, by the
name of 
Windsor.


Heere might I note that women with vs at their mar∣riage
do change their surnames and passe into their hus∣bands
names, and iustly for that then 
Non sunt du
, sed car

vna:
 And yet in 
Fraunce
 and the Netherlands, the better
sort of women will still retaine their owne name with their
husbands, as if 
Mary
 daughter of 
Villevill
 be married to

A. Vavin,
 she will write herselfe 
Mary Vavin Ville vill.
 But
I feare husbands will not like this note, for that some of
their dames may be ambitiously over-pert and too-too
forward to imitate it.


Beside these former alterations, the tyran Time which
hath swallowed many names, hath also in vse of speach,
changed more by contr
cting syncopating, cu
telling and
mollifying them, as beside them before mentioned.

DE LA ZOVCH, 
De Stipite sicc
.




For 
William de la Zouch
 Archbishop of 
Yorke,
 is so called
in this verse, for his valour in an encounter against the
Scottishmen at 
Bearparke.
 134
.


Est pater invictus sicc
 de stipite dictus, &c.


For 
Zouch
 signifieth the stocke of a tree in the French
tongue. And this translation of names into Greeke or
Latine, is still in vse among the Germans, for hee whose
name is 
Ertswert
 or 
Blackland,
 will be 
Melancthon;
 if 
New∣man,
Neander;
 if 
Holieman, Osiander;
 if 
Brooke, Torrenti
s;
 if

Fenne, Paludanus, &c.
 which some amongest vs beganne
lately to imitate.


To drawe to an end, no man whatsoever is to be disli∣ked
in respect either of originall, or of signification, for


neither the good names doe grace the bad, neither do evil
names disgrace the good; if names are to bee accounted
good or bad. In all countries both good and bad have bin
of the same surnames, which as they participate one with
the other in glory, so somtimes in shame. Therfore for an∣cestors,
parentage and names (as he said) let every man say

Vix ca nostra voco.
 Time hath intermingled & confused all,
& we are com al to this present, by successive variable des∣cents
from high and lowe: or as hee saieth more plainely,
the low are descended from the high, and contrariwise, the
high from low.


If any doe vaunt of their names, let them looke to it, lest
they have 
inania nomina;
 you know who faith, 
Vestra nomi∣na
nunquam sum admiratus, 
 vobis reliquerunt,
magnos arbitrabor.
 And if they glory in their auntient fai
e
names, and farr
 fetcht descents, with contempt of others,
happly some such like as 
Marius
 was, may returne vppon
them 
Marius
 wordes; 
Si iure despiciunt nos, faciunt idem
maioribus suis, quibus vti nobis ex virtu
 nobilitas caepit. In∣vident
honori nostro: ergo invideant labori, innocentiae. pericu∣lis
etiam nostris, quoniam per haec ill
 
.
 Yea some
of these occupation and office names, which doe seeme so
meane to some, are as auntient in this Realme as most o∣ther.
For in that most authenticall Register 
Doomesday

book in the Exchequer, ye shal have 
C
us, A
rifaber, 
∣tor,
Pistor, Accipitrarius, Camera
ius, Venator, 
 Mo∣dicus,
 

Cook, Goldsmith, Painter, Baker, Falconer, Cham∣berlaine,
Huntsman, Fisher, Marshall, Porter, Leach, and
others, which then held land 
in Capite,
 and without doubt
left these names to their posteritie, albeit happly they are
not mentioned in those tables of 
B
aile Abbey,
 of such as
came in at the Conquest: which whosoever consider well,
shall finde alwayes to be forged, and those names to be in∣serted
which the time in every age favoured, and were ne∣ver
mentioned in that authenticall Record.


If you please to compare the Roman names that seeme
so stately, because you vnderstand them not, you will dis∣daine


them in respect of our meanest names; For what is

Fronte
 but Beetle-browed? 
Casius
 but Cattes-eies? 
Petus

but Pink-eyed? 
Cocles
 One-eye, 
Naso
 Bottle-nose, 
Galba

Maggot, as 
Suetonius
 interpreteth; 
Sil
 Apes-nose, 
Ancus

Crooked arme, 
Pausa
 Broade foote, 
Strabo
 Squint-eye,

Suillius
 Swincheard, 
Capito
 Iobbernoll, 
Calvus
 Bald-pate,

Crispus
 Curle-pate, 
Flaccus
 Loll-eares, or Flagge-eared,

Labeo
 Blabber-lippe, 
Scaurus
 Knobd heele, 
Ʋarus
 Bow∣legged,

Pedo
 Long-shankes, 
Marcellus
 Hammer, for it
commeth from 
Marculus, Hortensius
 Gardner, 
Cilo
 Pet∣ty-long
pate,
 
Chilo
 Flap-lippes, or, as 
Velius Longus
 saith,

Impro
ribus labris hom
.


Those great names also 
Fabius, L
ntulus, Cicero, Piso,
Stolo,
 are no more in our tongue then Bean-man, Lentill,
Chich-pease,
 Pescod-man, Braunch; for as 
Plinie
 saieth,
these names were first appropriated to them, for skill in
sowing those graines. Neyther those from beasts which

Varro
 reciteth in the second 
de Rustica, Taurus, Vitulus, O∣vilius,
Por
ius, Caprilius,
 were better than Bull, Calfe, Sheep,
Hogge, Goate, &c.


In respect of these names all the names of 
England
 are
such as I thinke few would take the benefite of 
Dioclesians

rescript, which I lately mentioned. But in 
France
 (where
the fowle names 
Marmot, Merd
oyson, Boreau
) and in

Spaine
 (where 
Verdugo, i.
 Hangman, 
Putanero,
 and such like
are rife) it is no marvel that some procure licence from the
King to change their names: and that a Gentlewoman,
doctor 
Andreas
 the great Civilians wife said;
 
If faire names
were saleable, they woulde be well bought.


Thus much of Christian names and Surnames, or 
Prae∣nomina

and 
Nomina.
 As for 
Cognomina
 and 
Agnomina,
 or
By-names were rare in our Nation; onely I remember
these three, 
Le Beuf
 in the familie of the 
Giffardes,
 of 
Me∣uill

among the 
Darcies,
 and 
Bouchard
 in one house of the

Latimers,
 and some say 
Algernoun
 in the familie of 
Percies:

but that as yet is out of the reach of my reading, vnlesse it
be the same that is corruptly in the descent of the Earles of



Belleyn
 belonging to the late Queene Mother of 
France,

set downe 
Agernouns,
 for 
Alger
s;
 For so 
Eustace
 the
second is there by-named, who in other olde Pedegrees is
called 
Eustace
 with the cleare eyes.


As for additions given over and beside names, and sur∣names
in Law causes, that I may note them out of a Lawe
booke, they are either of estate, or degree, or mysterie, or
towne, or hamlet, or countie. Addition of estate are these;
Yeoman, Gentleman, Esquire. Addition of degree are
those which wee call names of dignitie, as Knight, Earle,
Marquesse, Duke. Additions of mysterie are such, Scrive∣ner,
Carpenter, Smith. Addition of townes, as of 
Pading∣ton,
Islington, Edelmeton.
 And where a man hath houshold
in two places, he shall be saide to dwell in both of them, so
that his addition in one of them doth suffice.


By the Statute the first yeere of king 
Henry
 the fift and
fift chapter, it was ordained, that in suites or in actions
where processe of Vtary lieth, such addition should be
to the name of the Defendant, to shew his estate, myste∣rie,
and place where he dwelleth, and that such Writts shall
abate, if they have not such additions, if the Defendant do
take exception thereat, they shall not abate by the office of
the court.


Also, Duke, Marquesse, Earle, or Knight be none of
that addition, but names of dignitie, which should have
beene given before the statute. Aud this was ordained by
the sayde statnte, made in the first yeare of king 
Henry
 the
seaventh chap. 5. to the intent that one man may not be
grieved or troubled by the vtlary of an other, but that by
reason of the certaine addition every man might be cer∣tainely
knowne, and beare his owne burden.


How the names of them which for capitall crimes a∣gainst

Maiestie,
 were creazed out of the publike Records,
Tables, and Registers, or forbidden to be borne by their
posteritie, when their memory was damned. I could shew
at large, but this and such like, with 
Misnomer
 in our lawes,
and other Quidities, I leave to the professours of lawes.



Somewhat might be said here of the adjuncts to names
or titles, which in most antient times were 
ther none, or
most simple. For 
Augustus
 was impatient to be called 
Do∣min

yet 
Domitian
 liked well to be called 
Dom 
nus Deus{que}

and 
Dominus
 was taken vp by everie private man, as ap∣peereth
by 
Seneca,
 and the poore Graecian which refused
that title by alluding 
.
Nevertheles it was never vsed by the Emperors, from 
Do∣mitian

to 
Dioclesianus,
 as 
Victor
 noteth; but afterward it
was continued by the Christian Emperors, yea vpon their
Coines.


And that which is more strange, they vsed then as ap∣peareth
in the Constitutions, for themselves. 
Aeternitat
nostra, Perennitas nostra, Numen nostrum;
 and to their prin∣cipall
officers, 
Vir illustri
, Vi
spectabilis, Magnifica cellitudo,
Sublimis magnit
do tua, Illustris magnificentia, Sublim
tas,
Miranda sublimitas, Eminentia tua, Excellentia tua, Praecelsa
magnificentia tua, &c.
 As appeareth in the Volumes of the
Civill Lawe. So as I know not wh
e that Spite king 
Bu∣chanan

should envy lesser titles to Princes, the verie Tipes
of Gods maiestie, yea verie Gods in earth, and brand
them with the marke of 
Seric
 nebulones,
 which honour
Princes therewith.


The Romans vnder the latter Emperours had a verie
curious and carefull observation, in giving titles to men of
reputation, which as I have read were onely five; 
Illustris

was the highest appropriated to the 
Praefecti Praetorio
 of 
I∣taly

and 
Gallia,
 the 
Prafectus
 of the Cittie of 
Rome, Magi∣ster
Equitum, Magister Peditum, Quaestor Palatij, Comes Lar∣gitania,
&c.
 and all that had voice in the Senate. 
Spectabi∣l

was the second 
 due to the Lievtenants generall, and

 of Provinces &c. So 
in Notitia Provinciarum, Vi∣carius
Britanniarum, Comes Littoris Saxonici per Britanni∣
.
Dux Britanniae
 are st
ed 
Viri spectabiles. Clarissimus

was the third title peculiar onelie to the 
Consulares, Corre∣ctores,

and 
Praesides
 of Provinces. 
Perfectissimus
 was the
fourth. 
Egregius
 the fift. And as 
Clarissimus
 was a title to


those great officers above specified, so no other could have
that, as neither of 
Perfectissimus,
 and 
Egregius,
 but graun∣ted
by Patents. And in that age, as it is in the Code of

Theodosius, Titulo, Vt Dignitatem ordo servetur. Si quis in∣debitum
sibi locum vsurpaverit, nulla seignoratione defendat,
sit{que} planè sacrilegij reus.


Amongst vs the Kings had these adiuncts, when they
were written and spoken vnto, 
Gloriosus, Gloriosissimus, Pra∣cellentissimus,
Charissimus Dominus, Rex illustris,
 lately 
Po∣tentissimus,
Invictissimus, Serenissimus;
 Our 
ege Lord, Our
Soveraigne. Our Dread Soveraigne &c.


As for 
Grace,
 it beganne about the time of 
Henry
 the
fourth. 
Excellent Grace
 vnder 
Henry
 the sixt. 
High and
mighty Prince
 vnder 
Edward
 the fourth. And 
Maiestie

which first beganne to the Roman Emperours about the
time of 
Gallienus,
 came hither in the time of King 
Henry
 the
eight, as 
Sacred Maiestie
 lately in our memory. Whereas a∣mong
Christians it was appli
ble onely in former ages to
God,
 as among the old Romans to the Goddesse 
Maiestie

the daughter of 
Honour
 and 
Reverence.


Among other men in former ages 
D
n
 corrupted from

Dominus,
 was the greatest attribute both to Spi
ituall and
Temporall, and afterward 
Worshipfull,
 and 
Right Worship∣full,

hath been thought convenient among vs for the great
Dukes and Fa
les; but wee nowe beginne so to overlade
men with additions, as Spaniardes did lately, vntill they
were restrained by the Pragmaticall 1586. At which time

Pasquil
 at 
Rome
 being demanded why 
Philip
 of 
Spaine
 had
so taken away all titles from all sortes of men, aunswered
merrily, albeit not religiously. That it may be verified of
him which is saide, 
Tu solus Do
inus, tu solus altissimus,
 in
respect of his voluminous long Title which will 
i
e the
Reader.


Thus farre had I proceeded in names, when it was hie
time to stay, for I am advertised that there is one, which by
Arte Trochilick, will drawe all English surnames of the
best families out of the pitte of Poetrie, as 
Bourchier
 from



Busyris
 the tyrant of 
Aegypt; Percy
 from flying 
Perseus;
Darcy
 from 
Dircaus Apollo; Lee
 from 
Laetus
 turned into a
Swanne in 
Ovid; Iakeson
 from 
Iason:
 well hee may satisfie
them herein, whom I cannot. As for my selfe, I acknow∣ledge
that I cannot satisfie neither them, nor my selfe in all
particularities: and well therefore I doe like h
m that said,
He dooth not teach well which teacheth all; leaving no∣thing
to subtill wittes to sift out. And sure I am scrupu∣lous
Diligence lieth open to Envie. But for such as wil not
be content with that which is said, I wish sir 
Iohn de Bil∣bao

would coniure vp 
William Ockam
 the father of the No∣minalles
(as 
Appion
 did 
Homer,
) for their better satisfacti∣on
heerein. Meane while I desire no man will take offence
at any thing heere spoken, when as I have beene so farre
from giving offence, that I dare protest it in that solemne
auntient forme, 
Superos, & Sydera testor.
 Hating it in o∣thers,
and condemning it in my selfe, even vnto the bot∣tomles
pitt of hell.








Allusions.


I
 Will now present vnto you a
few extracts out of names, (I
feare you will call them foolish
foppe
es,) but call them what
you please, I hope a little folly
may be pardonable in this our
so wise an age


Out of Names the busie
wit of man continually wor∣king
hath wrought vpon liking
or dislike Allusions, very common in all ages, and among
all men, 
Rebus,
 
 ages both with learned and vn∣learned,
and 
Anagramme
 though long since invented, yet
rare in this our refined times. In all which, I will briefly
shew our Nation hath beene no lesse pregnant, then those
Southerne which presume of wits in respect of 
.
Afterward somewhat shall be said of Armes, which as si∣lent
names distinguish families.


An Allusion is as it were a d
lliance or playing with
words, like in sound, vnlike in sence, by changing, adding,
or substracting a letter or two; so that words nicking and
resembling one the other, are appliable to diffrent signifi∣cations.
As the Almightie (if we may heerein vse sacred au∣thority,)
in ratification of his promise to the seede of 
Isaac,

changed 
Abram,
 ∴ High father, into 
Abraham,
 that is, fa∣ther
of many; and 
Sarai,
 that is, my Dame, into 
Sara,
 that
is, Lady or Dame. The Greekes (to omit infinite others,)


nicked 
Antiochus Epiphanes,
 that is, the famous, with 
Epi∣nanes,

that is, the furious. The Romans likewise played
with bibbing 
Tiberius Nero,
 calling him 
Biberius Mero.
 So

Tully
 called the extorting 
Verres,
 in the actions against
him 
Verrens,
 as Sweepe-all. So in 
Quintilian
 the sower fel∣low,

Placidus
 was called 
Acidus,
 and of late one called 
Sca∣liger,
Aliger.


Excellent is that which our countriman Reverend 
Beda

reporteth in his Ecclesiasticall History of 
England,
 of the
cause that mooved 
Gregory
 the Great to send 
Augustine

into 
England.
 On a time (as I shewed before) when he saw
beautifull boyes to be sold in the market at 
Rome,
 and de∣manded
by what name their Nation was called; and they
told him English-men; and iustly be they so called (quoth
he,) for they have Angelike faces, and seeme meete to be
made Coheirs with the Angells in heaven: After, when it
was tolde him that their King was called 
Alla,
 then said
he ought 
Alleluya
 to be sung in that Country to the praise
of their Creatour: when it was also signified vnto him, they
were borne in a part of the Kingdome of 
Northumber∣land,

called then 
Deira,
 now 
Holdernesse Deira Dei,
 (then
said he,) 
sunt liberandi.


Laurens
 Archbishop, which succeeded that 
Augu∣stine,

was by allusion called 
Lauriger, Mellitus, Mellifluus,
Brith-wald, Bright-world, Nothelhelme,
 Noble-helme, 
Cel∣nothu
,
Caelo natus,
 all archbishops of 
Canterbury.
 And such
like were framed out of the names of many English Con∣fessours,
which I omit.


Arletta,
 the good wench which so kindely entertained

Robert
 Duke of 
Normandy,
 when he begate of her 
William

the Conquerour, (as I had rather you should read in o∣thers
then heare of me,) was for his honesty, closely with
an aspiration called 
Harlot.
 But the good and learned Re∣corder
would say, that this name beganne from her, and in
honour of her, was appropriated by the Normans in 
Eng∣land,

to all of her kinde profession, and so continueth.


When 
Herbert
 first Bishop of 
Norwich,
 and founder of


the Cathedrall Church there, had simoniacally procured
that Bishopricke to himselfe, and the 
Abbacy
 of 
Winchester

to his father, they were alluded vpon by the name of 
Si∣mon

in the worst sence, in this verse.


Filius est Praesul, pater Abbas, Simon vter{que}.


Strong and suddaine was that Allusion of 
Gilbert Fo∣lioth

Bishop of 
Hereford,
 who when hee had incurred the
hatred of many, for opposing himselfe against 
Thomas Bec∣ket

Archbishop of 
Canterbury,
 one c
ed with a lowd
voyce at his chamber windowe at mid-night, 
Folieth, 
o∣lioth,
thy god is the goddesse
 Azaroth.
 Hee suddenly and
stowtly replied, 
Thou list fowle feind, my God is the God of
Sabaoth.


Hitherto may be referred that which 
Giraldus Cam∣brensis

reporteth. An Archdeacon named 
Pecc
tum
 or 
Pe∣che,

a rurall Deane called 
De vill,
 & a Iew travailing toge∣ther
in the Marches of 
Wales,
 when they came to 
Illustrate,

the Archdeacon said to his Deane, that their Iurisdiction
began there, & reached to 
Malpasse:
 The Iew considering
the names of the Deane, Archdecon, & limits, said by Al∣lusion:

Marvaile may it be if I scape well out of this Iurisdicti∣on,
where Sinne is Archdeacon, the Divell the Deane, and the
bounds Illustrate with Malpasse.


Alexander Nequam,
 a man of great learning, borne at
Saint 
Albanes,
 and desirous to enter into religion there,
after hee had signified his desire, writ to the Abot 
La∣conically.


Si vis, veniam, sin autem, tu autem.


Who answered as briefly, alluding to his name.


Si bonus sis, venias, si Nequam, nequaquam.


Wherevpon he changed his name to 
Neckam.


Philip Rependum,
 Abbot of 
Leicester,
 alluded thus vpon
the name of 
Neckam,


Es niger & nequam, cùm sis cognomine Neckam.



Nigrior esse potes, nequior esse nequis.


But hee repaied him with this re-allusion vppon the
name of 
Philipp.


Phinota faetoris, lippus malus omnibus horis, &c.


A London Poet dallied thus with the name of 
Fusta∣chius,

when he was preferred from Treasurer of the Ex∣chequer,
to be Bishop of 
London,
 1222. which was thought
a great preferment in that age.


Eustachi nupèr benè stabas, nunc benè stabis.


Ille status valuit, praevalet iste tamen.


Robert Passelve,
 an especiall favorite of 
Henry
 the third,
afterward by a court-tempest so shaken as he was glad to
be Parson of 
Derham
 in 
Norfolke;
 was alluded vnto while
he was in the Sun-shine, by 
Pass
le-eau,
 as surpassing the
pure water, the most excellent element of all, if you beleeve

Pindar.


This Allusion was composed to the honour of a reli∣gious
man called 
Robertus,
 resolving it into 
Ros, Ver, Thus.


Tu benè Robertus quasi Ros, Ver, Thus{que} vocaris,


Ros sata, ver flores, Thus h
locausta facit.


Sic tu Ros, Ver, Thus, geris haec tria, Ros sata verbi,


Ver floris morum, Thus holocausta precum.


Vpon the same, another framed this.


Robertus titulo dotatur triplice, Roris


Temperie, Veris dulcedine, Thuris odore.


Vpon the same name and invention I have also found
this,

Es benè Ros, Ʋer, Thus, Ros es qùod nectare stillas,


Ver, qùod flore vires, Thus, quia mente sapis.


Ros (inquam) Ver, Thus: Ros qui dulcedine stillat,


Ver quod flore nitet, Thus quod odore sapit.


Nam qùod tu sis Ros, Ver, Thus, perhibet tua Roris,


Temperies, Veris gratia, Thuris odor.



Vpon the same name 
Robertus,
 an other made 
Robur,
Thus,
 with this 
Distiche:


Tu benè Robertus quasi Robur, Thus: benè Robur,


Nam virtute vig
s, Thus, quia mente sapis.

When 
Pandulphus
 the Popes 
Nuncio
 came into 
England,

a scholler smoothed him with this foolish allusion.


Te totum dulcor perfundit, & indè vocaris,


Pandulphus quid Pan nisi totum? Dul nisidulcor!


Phu
 nisi fusus? id est, totus dulcedine fusus.


One in a dedication alluded vnto 
Roger
 an Ecclesiasti∣call
pe
son in this verse:

Qui Cleri Rogere Rosam geris, annno vati.


A poore Poet begging of one, whose name was 
Iohn,

which is in Hebrew, 
The grace of God,
 begged of him by
praising his name in this manner.


Nomen habes non immeritò Divina, Iohannes,


Gratia, voce sua conveniente rei.


Ergo vel gratus summo, vel gratia summi,


Es, pro parte meâ casus vter{que} facit.


Si summo gratus, ergo pietatis alumnus,


Ergo pauperibus ferre teneria apem.


Another played vpon the name of 
Turbervill,
 when
practising with the French, he plaied false with his Sove∣raigne
K. 
Edward
 the first.


Turbat tranquilla clàm Thomas Turbida Vil
a.


These may seeme over many in so slight a matter, yet
I will in respect of the persons, offer you two or three
more to be regarded. 
William,
 Lord 
Monti
y,
 famous for
his learning, great Grandfather to the honourable 
Charles,

now Earle of 
Denshire,
 who is no lesse famous for his ver∣tue
and hereditary love of learning; when hee was the
Queenes Chamberlaine, in an Epistle to 
Erasmus,
 called


king 
Henry
 the eight 
Octavius
 for 
Octavus
 resembling him
thereby to 
Octavius Augustus
 the onely mirror of Princely
vertues.


Lady 
Iane Grey
 daughter to the Duke of 
Suffolke,
 who
payde the p
ce of others ambition with her bloud, for her
excellency in the Greeke tongue was called for 
Greia,
Graia,
 and this made to her honour in that respect.


Miraris Ianam Craio sermone valere?


Quo nata est primùm tempore Crata fuit.


When the duke of 
Buckingham
 was put to death by the
practise of cardinall 
Wolsey
 a Butchers sonne, the Empe∣rour

Charles
 the fift saide, It was great pitty, that so faire
and goodly a Bucke should be woried to death by a Bu∣chers
curre; alluding either to the name of 
Buckingham,
 or
to a Bucke, which was a badge of honour to that familie.


Domingo
 a Spaniard in the time of Queene 
Mary,
 offen∣ded
with an Englishman that called him 
Domingus,
 tolde
him hee was 
Dominicu
;
 but hee was I assure you more
highly offended, when hee after for 
Dominicus
 called him

D
moniacu
.


In the beginning of her late Maiesties raigne one allu∣ded
to her name 
Elisabetha,
 with 
Illasa-Beata,
 that is, 
Safe
without hurt, and happy.
 The sense whereof, as the Almigh∣tie
by his fatherly mercy performed in her person, so shee
by her motherly providence vnder God effected in this
realme in blisfull peace and plenty, whereas contrariwise
other con
ining Regions have beene overwhelmed with
all kinde of miseries. The cause whereof, one in this last
French broyles referred by Allusion to 
Spania
 and 
Mania

two Greeke words, signifying Panury and Furie; but im∣plying
therein closely the late King of 
Spaine,
 and duke 
du
Maine.








Rebus, or Name-devises.


M
Any approoved customes, lawes, maners,
fashions, and phrases have the English al∣wayes
borrowed of their neighbours the
French, especially since the time of King

Edward
 the Confessour, who resided long
in 
Fraunce,
 and is charged by Historians of his time, to
have returned from thence wholy Frenchified; then by
the Norman Conquest which immediately ensued, after
by the honourable aliances of the Kings of 
England,
 with
the most renowned families, yea and with the verie royall
house of 
Fraunce.
 But after that the triumphant victorious
king 
Edward
 the third had traversed 
Fraunce
 with his vi∣ctories,
and had planted English colonies in 
Calice, Havres

and 
Guynes,
 our people bordering vpon the pregnant 
Pi∣cardes,

beganne to admire their fooleries in painted Poe∣sies.
For whereas a poesie is a speaking picture, and a pi∣cture
a speechlesse Poesie, they which lackt wit expresse
their conceit in speech, did vse to dep
int it out (as it were)
in pictures, which they called 
Rebus,
 by a Latine name
well fitting their devise. These were so well liked by our
English there, and sent hither over the streight of 
Callice

with full saile, were so entertained heere (although they
were most ridiculous) by all degrees, by the learned and
vnlearned, that he was no body that coulde not hammer
out of his name an invention by this wit-craft, and picture
it accordingly: whereupon who did not busie his braine
to hammer his devise out of this forge.



Sir 
Thomas Cavall,
 whereas 
Cavall
 signifieth an horse,
engraved a gallopping horse in his scale with 
 limping
verse;

Thomae credite, cùm cernitis eius equum.


So 
Iohn Eagleshead,
 as it seemeth, to notifie his name, a∣bout
his Armes, as I have seene in an olde S
ale with an
Eagles head, set downe this:

Hoc aquila caput est, signum{que} figura Iohannis.


The Abbot of 
Ramsey
 more wisely sette in his Seale a
Ramme in the sea, with this verse, to shew hee was a right
ramme;

Cuius signa gero dux gregis est, vt ego.


William Chaundler
 Warden of New colledge in 
Oxford,

playing with his owne name, so filled the hall-windowes
with candles, and these wordes, 
Fiat lux,
 that hee darke∣ned
the hall. Whereuppon the Vidam of Charters
when hee was there, saide, It should have bin, 
Fiant tene∣brae.


Did not that amorous Youth mystically expresse his
love to 
Rose Hill,
 whome hee courted, when in the border
of his painted cloth, hee caused to be painted as rudely, as
he devised grosely, a rose, an hill, an eye, a loafe, a well,
that is, if you will spell it.


Rose-Hill I love well.


You may imagine that 
Frauncis Corn
field
 did scratch
his elbow when hee hadde sweetely invented to signifie
his name, Saint 
Francis
 with his Frierly kowle in a corne∣field.


It may seeme doubtfull whether 
Bolton
 Prior of Saint

 In 
Smithfield,
 was vviser vvhen hee invented
for his name a bird bolt through a T
nne, or when hee
built him an house vppon 
Harrow Hill,
 for feare of an
mundation after a great coniunction in the watry Tripli∣citie.




Islip
 Abbot of 
Westminster,
 a man most favored by king

Henry
 the seaven
h, had a quadruple devise for his single
name; for somewhere hee s
tte vppe in his windowes an

ie with a slip of a t
ee, other places one slipping boughs
in a tree, in other places an I wi
h the saide slip; and in
some places one slipping from a t
ee with the woorde 
I∣slip.


Whosoever devised for 
Thomas
 Earle of 
Arundell,
 a ca∣pitall

A
 in a Rundle, wherewith hee decked an house
which hee built, did thinke I warrant you, that hee did the
Nobleman great honour.


No lesse did he 
 his invention, which for sir 
Antho∣ny
Wingfield,
 devised
 Wing with these foure letters,

F, E, L, D,
 quarterly about it, and over the Wing a crosse,
to shew he was a Christian, and on the crosse a red rose, to
shew that the followed the house of 
Lancaster.


Morton
 Archbishop of 
Canterbury,
 a man of great
wisedome, and borne to the vniversall good of this realme,
was content to vse 
Mor
 vppon a Tunne; and sometime a
Mulbery tree called 
Morus
 in Latine out of a Tunne. So

Luton, Thorneton, Ashton
 did notifie their names with a
Lute, a Thorne, an Ash vpon a Tunne. So an Ha
 on
a bottle for 
Harebottle;
 a Maggot-pie vppon a goate for

Pigot,
 an Hare by a sheafe of 
e in the Sunne for 
Harrison;

Med written on a calfe for 
Medcalfe; Chester,
 a chest with
a Starre over it: 
Allet
 a Lot; 
Lionel Duckes
 a Lion with 
L.

on his head, whereas it should have beene in his 
. If
the Lion had beene eating a ducke, it had beene a ra
e de∣vise
woorth a duckat, or ducke-egge. And if you require
more, I referre you to the witty inventions of some I 
∣doners,
but that for 
Garret Dews
 is most memorable, two
in agarret casting Dews at dice. This for 
Rebus
 may suf∣fice,
and yet if there were more, I thinke some lips would
like such kinde of Lettice. In parte to excuse them yet,
some of the greatest Romans were alittle blasted with this
fooleri
, if you so censure it. Our great Maister 
Cicero
 in
a dedication of his to his gods, inscribed 
Marcus 
,



and that 
 pulse lesse than, 
 call (I
thinke) a 
 pease, and the Latines 
Cicer,
 in steede of

Cicero.
 As in the coines of 
Iulius Casar
 wee have seene an
Elephant, for so 
Caesar
 signifieth in the Mauritanian tong,
and the two Mint-maisters in that age, 
L. Aquilius Florus,

and 
Voconius Vitulus;
 the one vsed a Floure, the other a
Calfe in the reverses of their coynes, alluding vnto their
names.








Anagrammes.


T
HE onely 
Quint-essence
 that hi∣therto
the 
Alchimy
 of wit coulde
draw out of names, is 
Anagramma∣tisme,

or 
Metagrammatisme,
 which
is a dissolution of a Name truly
written into his Letters, as his Ele∣ments,
and a new connexion of it
by artificiall transposition, with∣out
addition, substraction, or chang
of any letter into different words, making some perfect

.



o∣mitting or retaining it, for that it cannot challenge the 
ght
of a letter. But the licentiats somewhat licentiously lest
they should preiudice poeticall libertie, will pardon them∣selves
for doubling or reiecting a letter, if the sence fall apt∣ly,
and thinke it no iniury to vse 
E
 for 
AE, V
 for 
W, S
 for 
Z,

and 
C
 for 
K,
 and contrariwise.


The French exceedingly admire and celebrate this fa∣cultie,
for the deepe and farre fetched antiquitie, the piked
fines and the mysticall significations thereby: for that
names are divi
e notes, and divine notes do notifie future
events; so that events consequently must lurke in names,
which onely can be pried into by this mystery. Affirming
that each mans fortune is written in his name, as Astrolo∣gians
say, all things are written in heaven, if a man could


read them: They exemplifie out of the 
Rabbins;
 they quote
dreaming 
,
 with other allegations; they vrge
particular experiments, and so enforce the matter, with
strong words and weake proofes, that some credulous
yong men, hovering betweene hope and feare, might ca∣sily
be carried away by them into the forbidden supersti∣tion
of 
Onomantia,
 or South-saying by names.


But some of the sower sort will say it is nothing but a
troublous toy, and because they cannot attaine to it, will
condemne it, lest by commending it, they should discom∣mend
themselves. Others more milde will grant it to be a
daintie devise and disport of wit not without pleasure, if it
be not wrested out of the name to the reproach of the per∣son.
And such will not deny, but that as good names may
be ominous, so also good 
Anagrammes,
 with a delightfull
comfort and pleasant motion in honest mindes, in no
point yeelding to many vaine pleasures of the body. They
will also afford it some commendations in respect of the
difficultie, (
Diffici
a quae pulchra,
) as also that it is a whet∣stone
of a patience to them that shall practise it. For some
have beene seene to bite their penne, scratch their head,
bend their browes, bite their lips, beate the boord, teare
the paper when they were faire for somewhat, and caught
nothing heerein.


If profound antiquitie, or the inventour may commend
an invention, this will not give place to many. For as the
great Masters of the Iewes testifie, 
Moses
 received of God
a literall law, written by the finger of God, in the two Ta∣bles
of the ten Commaundements to be imparted to all,
and another Mysticall to be communicated onely to sea∣venty
men, which by tradition they should passe to their
posteritie, whereof it was called 
Cabala.
 Which was devi∣ded
into 
Mercana,
 concerning onely the sacred names of
God, and 
Bresith
 of other names consisting of Alphabe∣tary
revolution, which they will have to be 
Anagramma∣tisme,

by which they say 
Marie
 resolved made, 
Our holy
Mistris.
 But whether this 
Cabala
 is more ancient than the



Talmudicall
 learning, hatched by the curious Iewes, (as
some will,) about 200. yeares after Christ, let the learned
consider.


The Greeks referre this invention to 
Licophron,
 (as 
Isa∣ac
Tzetzes
 hath in his preface to his obscure Poeme 
Cas∣sandra,

who was one of those Poets which the Greekes
called the Seaven-starres, or 
Ple
ades,
 and flourished about
the yeare 380. before Christ, in the time of 
Ptolomaus Phi∣ladelphus,

king of 
Aegypt,
 whose name hee thus anagra∣matised.

ny.


And vpon 
Arsinoe

Afterward as appeareth by 
Eustachius
 there were some
Greekes disported themselves heerein, as he which turned

Atlas
 for his heavie burthen, in supporting heaven to 
Ta∣las,

that is, wretched, 
Aret, Virtue
 into 
Erate,
 that is, loue∣ly,

Ilaros,

Liar

 that is, warme. But in late
yeares, when learning revived vnder

 the French beganne to distill their wits heerein, for

The Italians who now admire them, beganne not 20.
yeares since to vse them as the Bishop of 
Grassa

In 
England
 I know some who 30. yeares since have be∣stowed
some idle houres heerein with good successe, albe∣it
our English names running rough with cragged conso∣nants,
are not so smooth and easie for transposition as the
French and Italian. Yet I will set downe some which I
have happened vpon, framed o
t of the names of divers
great personages, and others in most of the which in the
sence may seeme appliable to their good parts.

O Englands Soveraigne thou hast made vs happy:

And whereas the French compare

Whereas she was as a Sweepnet for the Spanish ships,
which (as the Athenians said of their fortunate

CALLOS TV TIBI TVRBES


Vt proavi preavus, sic GALLOS TV TIBI TVRBES;
















Impreses.


A
N Imprese (as the Italians call it) is a de∣vise
in picture with his Motte, or Word,
borne by noble and learned personages,
to notifie some particular conceit of their
owne: as Emblemes (that we may omitte
other differences) doe propound some
generall instruction to all: As for example: Wheras 
Cos∣mi
Medici
 Doke of 
Florence
 had in the ascendent at his
nativitie the signe 
Capricorue,
 vnder which also 
Augustus

and 
Charles
 the fift, two great and good Princes were
borne: hee vsed the celeshall signe 
Capricorne,
 with this
Mone; 
FIDEM FATI VIRTVTE SE QVEMVR

for his Imprese, particularly concerning his good hope
to proove like vnto them. But a faire woman pictured
with an Olive crowne representing 
Peace,
 carrying in
one hand the horne of Plenty, leading a little golden boy
for 
Plutus
 in the other, with, 
EX PACE RERVM
OPVLENTIA,
 is an Embleme, and a generall document
to all, that Peace bringeth Plentie.


There is required in an Imprese (that wee may reduce
them to few heades) a correspondencie of the picture,
which is as the bodie, and the Motte, which as the soule
giveth it life. That is, the body must be of faire represen∣tation,
and the word in some different language, wittie,
short, and answerable thereunto neither too obscur
 

too plaine, and most comm
nded, when it is an 
Hemislich,

or parcell of a verse.



According to these prescripts neither the starres with
the Moone in 
Tide
s
 shield in 
Aeschilus,
 neither 
Amphia∣raus

dragon in 
Pindare,
 neither the stemme of a shippe v∣sed
for a seale by 
Pompey,
 can have heere place: Much
lesse the reverses in Roman coynes, which were onely hi∣storicall
memorialles of their actes; as that of 
Claudius,

with a plowman at plow and this 
COL: CAMALODVN

was to signifie that he made 
Maldon
 in 
ssex
 a Colony,
 and
that of 
Hadrian
 with an Emperour, three souldiers, and

EXERC: BRITANNICVS
 was in memorie of some
good service by the three Legions resiant in this Isle at

Yorke, Chester,
 and 
Car-leon
 vpon 
Ʋske.
 That also of 
Se∣verus

with a woman sitting vppon Cliffes holding an en∣signe
in one hand, and as it were writing vppon a shield,
with 
VICTORIA BRITANN:
 was onely to shew his
victories here.


Such also as are set downe in 
Notitia Provinciarum,
 as
a Boore seiant for 
Iovij,
 a circle party 
per Saltier
 for 
Bri∣tanniciani,

a carbuncle (as Blazoners terme it) for 
Britan∣nici,
&c.
 cannot be admitted into the number of 
Impreses,

for they were the severall ensignes of severall militarie com¦panies,
whereof the two last seemed to be leavied out of
this Isle.


Childish it is to referre hither the shieldes of King 
Ar∣thurs

round-table Knights, when they were devised, as it
is probable, for no other end, but to teach yoong men the
termes of Blazon.


Neither are Armes to be referred hither, which were
devised to distinguish families, and were most vsuall a∣mong
the nobilitie in warres, tiltes and tournaments in
their coates called 
Coate-armours, Shields, Standards, Ban∣ners,
Pennors, Guydons,
 vntill about some hundred yeeres
since, when the 
French
 and 
Italian
 in the expedition of

Naples,
 vnder 
Charles
 the eight beganne to leave Armes,
happly for that many of them had none, and to beare the
curtaines of their mistresses beddes, their mistresses co∣lours,
or these Impreses in their banners, shields, and ca∣parisons:


in which the English have 
 and
albeit a few have borrowed somewhat from them, yet
many have matched them, and no few surpassed them in
wittie conceit, as you shall perceive heereafter, if you will
first give me leave to remember some imperfect Devises
in this kinde of some former Kings of 
England,
 which you
may well say to be livelesse bodies, for that they have no
word adioyned.


Of King 
William
 Conquerour I have heard none, nei∣ther
dare (as 
Iovius
 taketh the 
Sphinx Augustus
 signet for
an Imprese) so set downe our Conquerours seale? which
had his owne picture on horsebacke with these verses to
notifie his Dominions.


Hoc Normannorum Willelmum nosce patronum:


On the other side;


Hoc Anglis Regem signo fatearis eundem.


As a King of 
Sicile
 had about that time this;


Apulus & Calaber, Siculus mihi servit & Afer.


Stephen
 of 
Bloys
 the Vs
per tooke the signe 
Sagutari∣us,

for that hee obtained this kingdome when the Sunne
was in the saide signe.


King 
Henry
 the second grievously molested by the dis∣obedience
of his foure sonnes, who entred into actuall re∣bellion
against him, caused to be painted in his great
Chamber at his pallace in 
Winchester
 an Eagle with foure
yong chickens, whereof three pecked and scratched him,
the fourth picked at his eyes. This his devise had no life,
because it had no Motte: but his answer gave it life, when
he said to one demaunding his meaning, That they were
his sonnes which did so pecke him, and that 
Iohn
 the yon∣gest
whome he loved best, practised his death more busi∣ly
than the rest. [
Giraldus Cambrensis distinct

King 
Henry
 the third as liking well of Remuneration;
commaunded to be written in his Chamber at 
Woodstocke,

as it appeareth in the Recordes in the Tower,

Qui non dat quod amat; non accipit i
le quod optat.


Edmund Cr
uch-backe
 his second sonne first Earle of



Lancaster,
 vsed a red Rose, wherewith his Tombe at 
West∣minster

is adorned.


Edward
 the third bare for his devise the rayes of the
Sunne dispersing themselves out of a cloude, and in other
places, a golden truncke of a tree.


The victorious 
Blacke Prince
 his sonne vsed sometimes
one feather, sometime three, in token of his speedy execu∣tion
in all his services, as the Postes in the Roman times
were 
Pterophori,
 and wore feathers to signifie their flying
post-haste. But the tradition is, that hee wonne them at
the battell of 
Poitiers,
 whereunto hee adioyned this olde
English word 
IC DEN,
 that is, I serve, according to
that of the Apostle, 
The heire while he is a childe, differeth
nothing from a servant:
 These feathers were an an
ent or∣nament
of militarie men, as is evident by that of 
Ʋirgil:


Cuius olorina surgunt de vertice pennae:


And were vsed by this Prince before the time of 
Canoy
Chan
 the Tartarian, who because his life was saved by an
Owle, would have his people weare their feathers: from
whome 
Haithon
 fableth, that the people of 
Iurope
 recei∣ved
first the vse of feathers.


Iohn
 of 
Gaunt
 Duke of 
Lancaster,
 brother to this Prince,
tooke a red Rose to his devise (as it were by right of his
first wise the heire of 
Lancaster,
 as 
Edmund
 of 
Langley,

Duke of 
Yorke,
 tooke the white Rose. Before these two
brethren tooke these two Roses, which the fautors and fol∣lowers
of their heires after, bare in that pittifull distracti∣on
of 
England,
 betweene the families of 
Lancaster
 and 
York,

a white Rose-tree at 
Longleete,
 bare vpon one branch a
faire white rose on the one side, and as faire a red rose on
the other; which might as well have beene a fore-token of
that division, as the white henne with the bay sprigge
lighting in the lap of 
Livia Augusta,
 betokened the Empire
to her posteritie, which ended in 
Nero,
 when both the
brood of that hen failed, and the baies of that sprigge wi∣thered.


The said 
Edmund
 of 
Langley,
 bare also for an Imprese


a Faulcon in a fetter-locke, implying that he was locked
vp from all hope and possibility of the Kingdome, when
his brethren beganne to aspire therevnto. Wherevpon he
asked on a time his sonnes when he saw them, beholding
this devise set vp in a window, what was Latine for a fet∣ter-locke:
Whereat when the yong gentleman studied,
the father said, well then you cannot tell me, I will tell
you, 
Hic haec hoc tacea
s,
 as advising them to be silent and
quiet, and therewithall said, 
Yet God knoweth what may come
to passe heereafter.
 This his great Grandchilde King 
Ed∣ward

the fourth reported, when he commanded that his
yonger sonne 
Richard
 Duke of 
Yorke,
 should vse this de∣vise
with the fetter-locke opened, as 
Roger Wall
 an He∣rald
of that time reporteth.


King 
Richard
 the second, whose vntrained youth and
yeelding lenitie hastened his fall, vsed commonly a white
Hart couchant with a crowne, and chaine about his 
cke.
For wearing the which, soone after his deposition lost
their lives. He also vsed a pescod branch with the cods o∣pen,
but the pease out, as it is vpon his Robe in his Monu∣ment
at 
Westminster.


His wife 
Anne,
 sister to 
Wenceslaus
 the Emperour, bare
an Ostrich, with a naile in his beake.


King 
Henry
 the fourth (as it is in Maister 
Garters

booke,) vs
d onely a Fox tayled pendent, following 
lysan∣ders

advise, if the Lions skin were too short, to peece it out
with a Foxes case.


His halfe brethren surnamed 
Beausort,
 of their natall
place, who after were dukes of 
S
mmerset,
 &c. bare a port∣cullis
golde; wherevnto not long afterward was added
this word 
ALTERA SLCVRITAS.
 And not long since
by the Earles of 
Worcester,
 issued from them 
MVTARE,
AVT TIMERE SP
RNO.


His yonger sonne 
Humfrey
 Duke of 
Glocester,
 a noble
fautor of good letters, ba
e in that respect a Laurell branch
in a golden cup.



That most martiall Prince King 
Henry
 the fift, carried a
burn
ng Cresset, sometime a Beacon: and for his word,
(but not appropriate therevnto,) 
VNE SANS PLVS. One
and no more.


King 
Henry
 the sixt had two feathers in saltire.


King 
Edward
 the fourth, bare his white Rose, the fetter∣locke
before specified, and the sunne after the battell of

Mortimers
 crosse, where three Sunnes were seene imm
∣diately
conioyning in one.


King 
Richard
 the third bare a white Boare, which gave
occ
sion to the ryme that cost the maker his life.


The Cat, the Rat, and Lovell the Dog,


Rule all 
England
 vnder an Hog.


King 
Henry
 the seaventh, in respect of his descent from
the house of 
Summerset,
 vsed the Portcullis before menti∣oned;
and in respect of the vnion of the two houses of

Lancaster
 and 
Yorke
 by his marriage, the white Rose vni∣ted
with the red, sometime placed in the Sunne. And in
respect he was crowned in the field with King 
Richards

crowne, found in an hawtherne bush, hee bare the haw∣thorne
bush with the crowne in it; & with this he filled the
windowes at 
Richmond,
 and his Chappell at 
Westminster.


His wife Queene 
Elizabeth,
 had a white and red rose
knit together.


His mother Lady 
Margaret,
 Countesse of 
Richmond,

had three white Dasies growing vpon a turfe.


When king 
Henry
 the eight beganne his raigne, the
English wits beganne to imitate the French and Italian
in these devises, adding the Mots. First king 
Henry
 him∣selfe
at the interview betweene him and king 
Francis
 the
first, whereat also 
Charles
 the fift was present, vsed for his
Impresse, an English Archer in a greene coat, drawing his
arrow to the head, with this inscription, 
CVI ADHAE∣REO,
PRAEEST:
 whenas at that time those mighty
Princes banding one against the other, wrought him for
their owne particular.


His wife Queene 
Anne,
 a happy mother of 
Englands











happines by her most happy daughter, bare a white crow∣ned
Faulcon, holding a Scepter in her right talon, standing
vpon a golden truncke, out of the which sprowted both
white and red roses, with 
MIHI, ET MEAE


To the honour of Queene 
Iane,
 who died willingly
to save her childe King 
Edwarde,
 was devised after her
death a Phaenix in his funerall fire, with this Motte, 
NA∣SCATVR
VT ALTER.


King 
Edward
 the sixt bare (as the Blacke Prince) three
feathers in a crowne while his father survived, as Prince of

Wales,
 with 
IC DEN.


Queene 
Mary
 when she was Princesse of 
Wales,
 vsed
both a red and white Rose, and a Pomegranate knitte to∣gether,
to shew her descent from 
La
caster, Yorke,
 and

Spaine.
 When she came to the kingdome, by perswasion
of her Cleargie, she bare winged Time drawing Trueth
out of a pit, with 
VERIT AS TEMPORIS FILIA.


Her Successor of blessed memory Queene 
Elizabeth;

vpon occasions, vsed so many heroicall devises, as would
require a volume; but most commonly a Sive without a
Motte, for her words, 
VIDEO, TACEO,
 and 
SEM∣PER
EADEM,
 which shee as truely and constantly
performed.


Cardinal 
Poole
 shevvd the terrestrial globe incompassed
with a Serpent, adding this out of Saint 
Mathew, E∣STOTE
PRVDENTES.


NOw I will descend from the bloud Royall and for∣mer
time, and present vnto you a few Impreses born
by noble, and gentlemen of our nation, in our age, without
commenting vpon them, as the Italians vse. For the per∣sons
names I am to be pardoned as knowing them not,
when I observed them at Titles and else-where: But such
as adioyned after the olde and most laudable Italian man∣ner,
their Armes withall.



He signified his constancie in aduersitie, which painted
a man swimming and striving against the streame in a
tempestuous sea, with this, 
ANIMƲS TAMEN IDEM.


Desirous was he to rise, but found counterblasts, who
figured a man ascending a Mountaine, but repelled with
contrarie winds, with this Mot, 
NITENS AD SVM∣MA,
REPELLOR.


Henry Howard
 Earle of 
Surrey,
 sonne and heire to 
Tho∣mas

Duke of 
Norfolke,
 devised for himselfe, I know not
vpon what consideration, a broken piller with this word,

SAT SVPEREST.
 But I reade he was charged at his ar∣raignement
with that devise, the impaling of his Armes
with the Armes of Saint 
Edward,
 and erecting three ban∣queting
houses, as 
Bastilions
 in his garden neere 
Norwich;

as matters of great consequence and high treason, to the
losse of his life. This is that noble Earle of 
Surrey,
 who first
among the Nobilitie of 
England,
 conioyned the honour of
learning to the honour of high Parentage. Of whom the
learned 
Hadrianus Iunius
 giueth this testimonie in Lat∣tine,
which I cannot so well expresse in English, 
H
roicum
corporis filium, ingenium velox, & expromptum, memoria inex∣hausta,
plane{que} Mythridatica, sermo ob ipsis Gratiis effictus,
linguarum multiplex cognitio, &c.


He would either finde a way or make a way to his pre∣ferment,
which caused to be pourtrayed, a hand working
out a way in a craggie hill with a pickaxe, and this woord,

INVENIT AVT FACIT.


Sir 
Philip Sidney,
 to note that he persisted alwayes one,
depainted out the 
Caspian
 sea surrounded with his shoares,
which neither ebbeth nor floweth, and over it: 
SINE
REFLVXV.


He acknowledged his essence to be in his gratious So∣veraigne,
which bare a Sunne-diall, and the Sun setting, ad∣ding

OCCASV DESINET ESSE.


Hee might seeme to beare a vindicative minde, but I
thinke it was for some amorous affection, which bare a she
vpon an eye, with 
SIC ƲLTVS PEREAM.



Vpon his Princes favour he wholy 
, which devi∣sed
the Sunne shining vpon a bush, subscrib
g 
SI DE∣S
RIS
PEREO.


As he which in like sense bare the Sunne reflecting his
rayes from him, with 
QVOVS QVE AƲERTES▪


His devote minde to his Lady hee devoutly, though
not religiously shewed, which vnder 
Ʋenus
 in 
owde
chaunged the vsuall prayer into, 
SALVA ME DOMI∣NA.


He shewed his affectionate goodwill in height of cou∣rage,
that shewed in his shield, 
Atlas
 bearing heaven with
a roule inscribed in Italian, 
INTENDAM, CHE PƲO.


The force of love was well figured by him that gave an
Vnicorne (happly the badge of his family) reposing his
head in a Ladies lappe, with this worde, 
O QVANTA
POTENTIA.


Excellent was that of the late Earle of 
Essex,
 who when
he was cast downe with sorrow, and yet to be employed
in Armes, bare a blacke mourning shield without any fi∣gure,
but inscribed, 
PAR NVLLA FIGVRA DO∣LORI.


A stedfast settled minde was in that gentleman, that de∣vised
for himselfe a 
Pyramis
 open to winde and weather,
with 
NEC FLATV, NEC FLVCTV.


He noted our peaceable times, when having a Mar∣tia
l
minde, shewed an armed Knight soundly sleeping in
a cocke-boate vpon a calme Sea, with, 
AEQVORA
TVTA SILENT.


Hee played with a Name, and hoped remedy to his
Love, which d
vised a Rose, with that of 
Ovid,
 (leaving
out the neg
tive) 
AMOR EST MEDICABILIS
HFRBIS.


A Gentleman committed, and after to his great com∣mend
tion
enlarged, tooke to him for an Imprese, a Ball
vpon a Racket, sapers
ebing, 
PERCVSSA RESVR∣
O.


The Sunne declining to the Weast, with 
Occidens,


Occidens, I
 being short in the first word, and long in the
second, shewed that the safetie and life both of the bearer
and of others did depend on the light and life of the Sove∣raigne.


A studious lover of good letters framed to himselfe on∣ly
the figure of 
I
 with this philosophicall principle, 
OM∣NIA
EX VNO.


Out of Philosophie likewise an other, to notifie his
greatest impeachment, drew this principle, 
EX NIHI∣
O
NIHIL:
 and inscribed it bend-wise, with his Armes
in a bare shield.


One weighed downe with some adverse happe, and
yet not altogether hopelesse, painted an heavy stone fast∣ned
to a mans arme with, 
SPES MIHI MAGNA TA∣MEN.


Neither seemed he voide of all hope for his paines, after
long service, which painted a followe fielde with, 
AT
QVANDO MESSIS.


The Needle in the Sea Compasse still moving but to
the North poynt onely with 
MOVEOR IMMOTVS,

notified the respective constancie of the gentleman to one
onely.


The ornament of our land was meant by him which
placed only the Moone in heaven in full light with, 
QVID
SINE TE COELVM?


Farre was he from 
Venus
 service with bare 
Venus
 por∣trayed
in a cloude with 
NIHIL MINVS.


But whole devoted was hee to that goddesse, which
contrariwise bare the Astronomicall character of 
Ʋenus,

with 
NIHIL MAGIS.


The successive varietie of wordly affaires, or his owne
favours, a studious Gen
leman well noted, which painted
in an Hemisphere some starres rising some setting, with,

SVRGVNT QVE CADVNT QVE VICISSIM.


His whole trust reposed that good Divine in God, which
after some adversities set vppe a Rocke beaten with winde
& weather, to expresse his state yet standing, with 
DEO


IVVANTE, DEO CONSERVANTE.


Heavenly cogitations were in him, who onely figured
a man kneeling, with 
is hands lifted vp to the heavens,
with this inscribede, 
SVPREMA OPTIMA MVNDI.


A verie good invention was that to shew his stay and
support by a virgin Prince, who presented in his shield,
the Zodiacke with the Characters onely of 
Leo
 and 
Vir∣go,

and this word, 
HIS EGO PRAESIDIIS.


It may bee thought that he noted deserts to bee everie
where excluded, and meere happe to raise most men, who
inscribed within a Laurell Garland, 
FATO, NON
MERITO.


A lavish tongue might seeme to have damnified the
Gentleman which tooke for his device Landskip, as they
call it, and solitarie Mountaines, with 
TVTI MONTES,
TVTVM SILENTIVM.


He had no great care to exp
esse his conceit in an Im∣prese,
which neverthelesse he did expresse, which bare a
white shield enscribed, 
NEC CVRA, NEC CHA∣RACTER.


No Knight of 
Venus
 was he, who as triumphing over
her force, bare her Sonne winged 
Cupid
 in a nette, with

QVI CAPIT, CAPITVR.


The Starre called 
Spica Virginis,
 one of the fifteene
which are accompted to be of the first magnitude among
the Astronomers, with a scrole in written, 
MIHI VITA
SPICA VIRGINIS,
 declared thereby happly, that hee
had that Starre in the ascendent at his Nativitie, or rather,
that he lived by the gracious favour of a virgin Prince.


One in our sea-faring age adventuring himselfe and all
he had to the Seas, proposing no certaine arrivall to him∣selfe,
made a Ship with full sayles in the Sea, and superscri∣bed,

PORTVS IN IGNOTO.


His minde mounted above the meane, which devised
for himselfe, one that had clambred much more then halfe
the way of a sleepe Mountaine, adding this worde neere
him, 
DIXERVNT FATVI,
 omitting the other part of


the verse, 
Medicum tenuere beati.


Likewise he hoped to attaine the height of his desire,
which made one climing to the middle of a 
Piramis,
 with

HAC SPE,
 by him, and 
ILLIC SPES
 aboue him.


Another also which climed in his conceyt, but as it see∣meth
fearing a fall, made a man vpon the vpp
r degree
 of
a Ladder, with this Mot adioyned, 
NON QVO, SED
VNDE CADO.


He referred Fate, Fortune and all to his Soveraigne,
which drew for himselfe the twelve houses of heaven, in
the forme which 
Astrologians
 vse, setting downe neither
Signe, nor Planet therein, but onely placing over it this
worde, 
DISPONE.


The like reference had he which onely vsed a white
Shield, and therein written, 
FATVM INSCRIBAT
ELIZA.


It may bee doubtfull whether hee affected his Sove∣raigne,
or iustice more zealously, which made a man ho∣vering
in the aire, with 
FEROR AD ASTAEAM.


You may easily coniecture what he conceyued, who in
his shield reared an Oare with a 
aile fastned therevnto,
adding. 
FORS ET VIRTVS MISCENTVR IN V∣NVM.


Full of loving affection was he to his Ladie, which bare
a Rose vpon his pricking branch, and 
ABIGITQVE
TRAHITQVE.


With many a blustring blast he seemed to have beene
tossed, which painted an Horizon, with all the Cardinall
and collaterall windes blowing, and in the middest 
RA∣PIVNT

As to the honour of 
Magellanus
 (whose ship first passed
round about the world, though he miscaried) was devised
the terrestriall Globe, with, 
TV PRIMVS CIRCVM∣DEDISTI
ME.
 So our Sir 
Francis Drake,
 who fortu∣nately
effected the same, had devised for him a Globe ter∣restriall,
vpon the height whereof in a ship vnder sayle,
trayned about the Globe with two golden halsers, by dire∣ction


of an hand out of a cloud, and a dragon volant vp∣on
the hatches, regarding the direction with these wordes,

AVXI

An Imprese too perplexed and vnfitting for so worthy
a mā, who as one said to him most excelētly in this Distich

PLVS VLTRA, Herculeis inscribas Drake 
,


Et magno dicas Hercule maior 
.


A man ve
ly worthie to bee eternized by some good
p

Iohn Oxenham,
 who ariving with
70. men in the straight of 
Dariena
 in 
America▪
 drew a land
his ship▪ and hiding it with boughes, marched ouer the
l

Negros,
 vntill bee came
to a riuer where he cut wood made him a Pinasse, entred
the South sea, went to the Island of 
Pearles,
 lay there ten
dayes, intercepted in two Spanish shippes 60. thousand
weight of gol
e, and one hundred thousand in barres of
silver, returned safely to the maine land: but through the
mutinie of his souldiers he miscaried, and as the Poet sai
h,

Magnu excidit ausis.
 In an adventure never attempted by
any, and therefore not to be forgotten, when as the 
Lopez

a Spaniard hath recorded it not without admiration, as
you may see in the Discoveries of the lea

M Rich. Ha

 But pardon this d
gression oc∣casioned
by the memorie of Sir 
Fr. Drake.


It seemed a difficultie vnto him to l

libertie or in bondage, w
i
h painted one Greyhound
coursing, with, 
IN LIBERTATE LABOR,
 and ano∣ther

i

IN SERVI∣TVTE

I can not imagine what he m

deuise a small brooke passing along the lands 
ldly, till it
came to a damme, and there rising and raging overflowed
the lands, with, 
MAGIS MAGIS QVE,
 written in the
place ouerflowed: vnlesse he would giue vs to vnderstand
that the more his affections were stopped, the more they
were stirred.


He which tooke a man armed at all poynts with,

 while he shewed a resolution in his owne
behalfe, forgat God, and that of King 
Henrie

DIEV ET MON DROIT,

In the Impreses of 
Ruscelli,
 I find that Sir 
Ri
hard Shet∣ley,

Knight of 
S: Ioh
s,
 vsed a white Faulcon, with th
s
Spanish Motto, 
FE Y FIDALGVIA. Id est.
 Faith and
gentlenesse, which Faulcon he quartered in his arme
 by
the name of 
Michelgroue,
 As they say.


Whereas the Laurell sacred to learning is never hurt by
lightning, and therefore the Cocke resorteth therevnto in
tempests, as naturall Historians testifie. He seemed studi∣ous
of good learning, and feareful of daunger, which cau∣sed
to be painted for him a Cocke vnder a Laurell, with,

SIC EVIT ABILE FVLMFN.

An amorous affection was onely noted in him which set
downe an eye in an heart, with, 
VVLNVS ALO.


Hee also helde one course, and levelled at one marke,
which made a Riuer in a long tract disgorging himselfe
into the Sea, with 
SEMPER AD MARE.


Hee doubted not to find the right course by indirect
meanes, which did set downe a sphericall crooked paire of
Compasses, with 
PER OBLIQVA RE
TA.


Hee proposed to himselfe honour in Martiall seruice,
which made a Trophee, or truncke of a tree, with harnesse
and abillements of warre, and a Sepulchre not farre off,
adding vnder-neath, 
AƲT SPOLIIS LAETEMVR
OPIMIS.
 Omitting that which followeth in 
Virg
l, Aut
Laetho insigni.


A warie man would he seeme, and carefull for his owne,
which shewed a village on fire, with 
I AM PROXIMVS
ARDET.


Tyred might he seeme with Law-delayes, or such like
sutes, which deuised for himself a tottering ship with torne
sayles driuen vp and downe, with 
I AM SEVTIMA
PORTAT.
 You know what followeth, 
Omn

In the beginning of her late Maiesties raigne, one vpon


happie hope conceyved, made an halfe of the Zodiake,
with 
Virgo
 rising, adding 
I AM REDIT ET VIRGO:

Suppressing the wordes following, 
Redeunt Saturma
regna.


Varietie and vicissitude of humane things he seemed to
shew, which parted his shield, 
Per Pale, Argent, & Sables,

and counterchangeably writte in the Argent, 
ATER,

and in the Sables, 
ALBVS.


He elegantly shewed by whom he was drawne, which
depainted the N

AVT MAGNES,
AVI MAGNA.


Another ascribing his life and all to his Ladie, pictu∣red
at 
 neere a spring, and at the roote thereof, 
QVOD

He shevved himselfe to be a Martiall, and a Mercuriall
man, vvhich bare a svvorde in one hand, and a Bay in the
other, vvith 
ARTI ET MARTI.


It might seeme a craving Imprese, vvhich set nothing
but Ciphers downe in a ro
le, with 
ADDE VEL V∣NVM.


Likewise hee which set downe the nine numerall fi∣gures▪
with 
ADDE, VEL ADIME.


His meaning might be perceyved out of the last Eg∣logue
of 
Virgill,
 containing 
Gallus
 loving lamentations,
which po
 trayed a tree, and in the barke engraved 
E,

adding this worde, 
CRES

Studious in 
Alchimy
 might he seeme, or in some ab∣struse
Art which he could not finde out, which shewed
for his devise onely a golden branch, with 
LATET AR∣BORE
OPACA.


Hee se
med not to respect hopefull tokens without
good effects, which made a ship sinking, and the Raine∣bow
appearing, with 
QVID TV, SI PEREO.


I know one which overcome with a praedominant hu∣mour
was so troubled with a fancifull v

so that no counsel or company could withdraw him from
it, figured a man with a shadow pro

with this word,

A Gentleman scholler drawne from the Vniversitie
where he was well liked to the Court, for which in respect
of his bashfull modestie, he was not so fit; painted a red
corall branch, which while it grew in the sea was greene,
with this, 
NVNC RVBEO, ANTE VIREBAM.


Master 
Richard Carew
 of 
Anthony,
 when he was in his
tender yeares, devised for himselfe an Adamant vpon an
Anvile, with a hand holding an hammer thereover, and
this Italian 
Motto, CHE VERACE DVRERA:
 which
also contained his name Anagranimatically.


He seemed not to be sufficiently warmed, living in the
Sun-shine of the Court, which framed for his devise a
glasse of Parabolicall concavitie, or burning glasse as some
call it, with the Sunne shining over it, and a combustible
matter kindled vnder it, with 
NEC DVM CALES∣CO.


He doubted not but continuall suit would molifie his
Mistris heart, which made an eye-dropping teares vpon
an heart, 
SAEPE CADINDO.


He lacked but some gracious hand to effect some mat∣ter
well forward, which made more then halfe a circle with
a paire of compasses, the onefoote fixed in the center, the
other in the circumference, placing thereby, 
ADDE MA∣NƲM.


His conceit was godly and 
owe spondent to his name,
who made an, Hart to his race to a fountaine and over it,

ƲT CFRVVS FONTEM,
 and vnder it, 
SIC ABRA∣HAMVS

 The meaning is plaine to all
which know Scriptures, and I take the Gentlemans name
to be

 The same Imprese was vsed by

 the best Cardinall which I have heard of, but with
this word, 
VNA SALVS.


When the Spania
ds purposed the invasion 1588, and
their Navie was scattered to their confusion, by a ship fi∣erd
and carried among them by direction from her late
Maiestie. A Gentleman depainted that Navie in confu∣sion


with a fiered ship approaching, adding to her ho∣nour
out of 
Ʋirgil: DVX FAEMINA FACTI.


This calles another to my remembrance, which I have seen
cast in silver, as concerning that matter, A great Navy vp∣pon
the sea neere the South coast of 
Englād,
 with 
VENIT,
VIDIT, FVGIT:
 As that of 
Iulius Casar,
 when he had
overcome 
Pharmaces, VENI, VIDI, VICI.


About that time, vvhen some dislikes grew betweene
the English and the States of the vnited Provinces, they
fearing that it might tend to the hurt of both, caused to be
imprinted two pitchers floating on the water vpon a Me∣dalia,
with 
SI COLLIDIMVR, FRANGIMVR.


In the like sense, there vvere comed peeces vvith two
Oxen drawing the plough, the one marked vvith a rose
for 
England,
 the other vvith a Lyon on the shoulder for

Holland,
 and vvritten thereby,

He measured himselfe vvith a meane, and seemed to

therein was dashed.


He signified himselfe to be revived with gracious favor,
which made the Sun-shining vpon a

vsed to her late Maiesties he now, the whole constellation
of 
Ariadnes

word: 
CAELVM QVE SOLVMQVE BE AVIT.


A setled conscience did he shew, which made a 
Haley∣on

hovering against the winde with, 
CONSTANS CON∣TRARIA

 The Fishers do say, that when
it is dead and hanged vp, turneth the belly alwaies to the
winde.


He might seeme to be in some hard distresse, which car∣ried
a Viper vpon his hand, with this word over written,

MORS, VEL MORSVS.


He might seeme to reach at some of 
Vulcans
 order,
which made a Bucke casting his hornes, with 
INERMIS

It was some loving conceite expressed by him, which
bare two Torches, the one light, the other out, with, 
EX∣TINGƲOR

Another presenting himselfe at the Tilt, to shew him∣selfe
to be but yong in these services, and resolving of no
one Imprese, tooke onely a white shield, as all they did in
olde time, that had exployted nothing: and in the base
poynt thereof made a Painters pensill, and a little shell of
colours, with this Spanish word, 
HAZED ME QVE

 Make of me what you will.


At that time one bare a paire of Scales, with fire in one

The same day was borne by an other, many flies about
a candle, with, 
SIC SPLENDIDIORA PETVN∣TVR.


In an other shield, (if I am not deceived) droppes fell
downe into a fire, and there-vnder was written, 
TAMEN

The Sunne in another shield did seeme to cast his rayes
vpon a starre, partely over-shadowed with a cloude, and
thereby was set downe,

A letter folded and sealed vp, superscribed,

¶Grave Speeches, and wittie Apo∣thegmes
of woorthie Personages
of this Realme in former
times.


T
Wenty yeares since, while 
I: Bishop

(whose memory for his learning is
deare to me) and my selfe turned
over all our Historians wee could
then finde, for diverse endes, wee
beganne to note aparte the Apo∣thegms
or Speeches (call them
what ye wil) of our nation. Which
since that time I have so farre encreased, as our Coun∣trey-Writers
spare in this point, have affoorded; and
heere doe offer them vnto you. Albeit I doe knowe
they will lie open to the censure of the youth of our time,
who for the most part, are so over-gulled with self-liking,
that they are more then giddy in admiring themselves, and
carping whatsoever hath beene done or saide heeretofore,
Neverthelesse I hope that all are not of one humour, and
doubt not, but that there is diversitie of tastes, as was a∣mong

Horaces
 guests; so that which seemeth vnsavorie to
one, may seemed dainty to another, and the most witlesse
speech that shalbe set downe, wil seeme wittie to some. We
knowe that whereas 
Dianaes
 Temple at 
Ephesus
 was bur∣ned
that night that 
Alexander
 the Great was borne;
 one
saide, 
It was no marvel, for she was then absent, as mother
Midwise,
 
at so great a child-birth▪ Tully
 dooth commend
this for a wittie conceit, and 
Plutarch
 condemneth it as a


witlesse ieast. The like is to be looked for in these, which
neverthelesse whatsoever they are in themselves, or in o∣ther
mens iudgements, I commend them to such indiffe∣rent,
courteous, modest Readers, as doe not thinke basely
of the former ages, their country, and countriemen; leaving
to other to gather the pregnant 
Apothegmes
 of our time,
which I knowe wil finde farre more favour. And that I
may set them in order of time, I will beginne with the an∣tient

Britan
 Prince, called by the Rom
ns 
Caratacu
 (hap∣ply
in his owne tongue 
Caradoc
) who flourished in the
partes now called 
Wales,
 about the sixt
eth yeare after the
birth of Christ.


CAratacus 
a Britaine that 9. yeeres withstood the Ro∣man
p
ssance, was at length vanquished, and in tri∣umphant
manner with his wife, daughters, and brethren,
presented to
 Claudius 
the Emperour, in the view of the
whole cittie of
 Rome. 
But he nothing appalled with this
adversitie, delivered this speech;
 Had my moderation and
carriage in prosperitie, beene answerable to my Nobilitie and
Estate, I might have come hither rather a friend than a cap∣tive;
neither would you have disdained to have entred amitie
with me being nobly descended and soveraigne over many peo∣ple.
My present state, as it is reproachfull to me, 
o it is hono∣rable
to you: I had horsemen, munition and money, what mar∣vel
is it, if I were loath to loose thems If you will be soveraign

over all, by consequence all must serve you: Had I yeelded at
the first, neither my power, nor your glorie had beene renew∣ned,
and after my execution oblivion bad ansewed: But if you
save my use, I shall be for ever a president and proofe of your
clemencie. 
This manly speech purchased pardon for him
and his, and the Senate assembled adiudged the taking of
this poore Prince of
 Wales, 
as glorious, as the conquering
of
 Siphax 
King of
 Numidia 
by
 P. Scipio, 
or of
 Perses 
King
of
 Macedonia 
by
 L. Paulus. [Tacitu
]



When this 
 now enl
rged was carried about
to see the state and magnificence of 
Rome, Why doe you

(saide hee) 
so greedily desire our poore cottages, when as you
have such stately and magnificall pallaces? [Zonaras
]


In the time of 
Nero,
 when the Britans could no longer
beare the iniustice wherewith the Romans both h
re and
elsewhere grounded their greatnes; 
Bundica,
 called by some

Boadicia,
 Princesse then of the partes of 
Norffolke
 and 
Suf∣folke,

exceedingly iniuried by them, animated the Britan

to shake off the Roman bondage, and concluded: 
Let the
Romaines which are no better than Hares and F
xe
 vnder∣stand
that they make a wrong match with Wool
es and Grey∣houndes:

And with that woorde lette an Hare o
t of her
lappe, as a fore-token of the Romans fearefulnesse, but
the successe of the b
ttell prooved otherwise. [
Xiphili∣nus.
]


Calgacus
 a warrelike Britan commaunding in the north
parte of this Isle, when he had encouraged his people with
a long speach to withstand the Romans ready to invade
them, concluded emphatically with these words, 
You are
now come to the shocke, thinke of your auncestors, thinke of
your posteritie:
 for the Britans before the arivall of the Ro∣mans
enioyed happy liberty, and now were in daunger of
most heavy slaverie.


Severus
 the Emperour an absolute Lorde of the most
parte of this Isle, when from meane estate hee had ascen∣ded
to the highest honour, was woont to say, 
I have beene
all, and am never the better.


When hee lay sicke of the gowt at 
Yorke,
 and the souldi∣ers
had saluted his sonne there by the name of 
Augustus
 as
their Soveraigne: he got him vppe, caused the principall
practisers of that fact to be brought before him, and when
they prostrate craved pardon, hee laying his hand vppon
his head, sayde; 
You shall vnderstand, that my head, and not
my feete dooth governe the Empire:
 and shortly after ended
his life in the cittie of 
Yorke
 with these wordes; 
I found the
State troublesome every where, and I leave it quiet even to


the Britans, and the Empire sure and firme to my children, if
they be good, but vnsure and weake if they be bad:
 A man he
was verie industrious, of marvellous dispatch, and so inv∣red
in continuall action, that at the last gaspe he said, 
And
is there any thing for me to doe now?


While he ruled, the world was so loose that three thou∣sand
were indicted at 
Rome
 of adultery, at which time 
Iu∣lia

the Empresse blamed the wife of 
Argetocox
 a northern
Britaine Lady, that the Brittish women did not accord∣ing
to womanhoode carry themselves, in accompanying
with men, (for then tenne or twelve men hadde twoo or
three wives common among them.) But she not ignorant
of the Roman incontinencie, replied; 
Wee accompany in∣deede
with the best and bravest men openly, but most vile and
base companions doe vse you secretly. [Xiphilinus]


At 
Yorke
 also died 
Constantinus Chlorus
 the Emperour,
who being not able to furnish 
Dioclesian
 his consort in the
Empire with such a masse of mony, as he required at that
instant, saide, 
Hee thought it better for the common-weale
that many should be in the handes of private men, then shutte
vp in the Emperors coffers;
 concurring with 
Traiane,
 who
compared the treasure of the Prince vnto the splene, that
the greater it groweth, the limbes are the lesser. [
Euse∣bius.
]


His sonne 
C
nstantine,
 invested in the Empire at 
Yorke,

(and a Britan borne as all Writers consent, beside 
Nico∣phorus

who lived not long since, and now 
Lipsius
 deceived
by the false printed coppie of 
Iul. Firmicus,
) the first Em∣perour
which advanced the faith of Christ, followed the
humilitie of Christ, for hee vsed to call the common peo∣ple,

His fellow servants and brethren of the Church of God.


When a slattering Priest (for in all ages the Clericall
will flatter, as well the Laicall) tolde him that his godlines
& virtues iustly deservd to have in this world the empire
of the world, and in the world to come, to raigne with the
sonne of God: The humble Emperour cried, 
Fie, fie, for
shame, let me heare no more such vnseemely speeches: but ra∣ther


suppliantly pray vnto my Almightie Maker, that in this
life, and in the life to come, I may seeme worthy to be his ser∣vant.


When hee sought by severe edicts to abolish all hea∣thenish
superstition, and laboured by godly lawes to esta∣blish
the true religion and service of Christ; yea, and vn∣cessantly
endevoured to draw men vnto the faith, perswa∣ding,
reproving, praying, intreating in time, out of time,
publikely and privately: he one day said merrily, yet truly
vnto the Bishop, that he had bidden to a banquet, 
As ye
be Bishops within the Church, so may I also seeme to be a Bi∣shop
out of the Church.


He disswading one from covetousnes, did with his lance
draw out the length and bredth of a mans grave, saying:

This is all that thou shalt have when thou art dead, if thou canst
happily get so much.


He made a law, that no Christian should be bondman
to a Iew, and if that any Iew did buy any Christian for his
slave, hee should bee fined therefore, and the Christi∣an
enfranchised; adding this reason: 
That it stoode not with
equitie, that a Christian should be slave vnto the murderers of
Christ.


Ethelbert 
King of
 Kent, 
was hardly induced to imbrace
Christian Religion at the perswasion of
 Augustine, 
sent to
convert the English Nation: but at length, being perswa∣ded
and desirous to be baptized, said:
 Let vs come also to
the King of Kings, and giver of Kingdomes: it may redound to
our shame, that we which are first in authoritie, should come
list to Christianitie: But I doe beseech that true King, that
he would not respect the precedence in time, but devotion of my
m
nde, [Ioscelinus.]


When
 Paulinus 
brought vnto
 Edwin 
king of
 Northum∣berland,

the glad tidings of the salvation of mankinde by
Christ, and preached the Gospel vnto the king and his
Nobilitie, zealously and eloquently, opening vnto them
the mysteries of our faith and precepts of Christian Re∣ligion;
one of the Lords thus spake vnto the King, (but


some now happily will smile at this speach,
) We may 
ely
compare mans state vnto this little Robbin-redbrest, that is
now in this cold weather heere in the wa
me chamber chirpeng
and singing merrily, and as long as she shall remaine heere, wee
shall see and vnderstand how she doeth: but anone when she shall
be flowne hence abroad into the wide world, and shall be for∣ced
to feele the bitter stormes of hard winter, we shall not know
what shall become of her: So likewise we see how men fare as
long as they live among vs, but after they be dead, neither wee
nor our Religion have any knowledge what becomes of them:
Wherefore I do thinke it wisedome to give care vnto this man,
who seemeth to shew vs, not onely what shall become of vs, but
also how we may obtaine overlasting life heereafter. 
Beda.


When 
Rodoald
 king of the East 
Angles,
 being wonne
with rewards, was shamefully minded to have delivered
vnto 
Edelfride
 the king of 
Northumberland,
 the innocent
Prince 
Edwin,
 who had fled vnto him to be saved from
the bloodie hands of 
Edelfride,
 who had vnlawfully be∣reaft
him of his kingdome: His wife turned his intent, by
telling him, that 
It stoode not with the high and sacred state
of a King to buy and sell the bodies of men, as it were a peti
∣chapman:
or that which is more dishonourable, slave-like to
sell away his faith, a thing which hee ought to hold more preci∣ous
then all the gold and gemmes of the whole world yea and his
owne life.
 Beda.


Ina
 King of West-Saxons, had three daughters, of
whom vpon a time he demanded whether they did love
him, and so would do during their lives above all others;
the two elder sware deepely they would, the yongest, but
the wisest told her father flatly without flattery, 
That al∣best
she did love, honour, and reverence him, and so would whilst
she lived, as much as nature and daughterly dutie at the vtter∣most
could expect: Yet she did thinke that one day it would come
to passe, that she should affect another more servently, meaning
her husband, when she were married: Who being made one flesh
with her as God by commaundement had told, and nature had
taught h
r she was to cleave fast to, forsaking father and mother,


kisse and kinne.
 [Anonymus.] One referreth this to the
daughters of king 
Leir.


Imperious was that speech of 
Theodore
 the Grecian,
Archbishop of 
Canterbury,
 in depriving a poore English
Bishop, 
Although we can charge you with nothing, yet that
we w
l we wi
l:
 like to that, 
Sie volo, sic 
ubeo, stat pro ratione
voluntas:
 But humble was the English Bishops reply: 
Paul
appealed from the Iewes to Caesar, and I from you to Christ. Vi∣ta
S. Wilfredi.


The reverend 
Bede,
 whome wee may more easily ad∣mire,
than sufficiently praise for his profound learning in
a most barbarous age, when he was in the pangs of death,
saide to the standers by; 
I have so lived among you, that I am
not ashamed of my life, neither feare I to die, because I have a
most gratious Redeemer.
 Hee yeelded vp his life with this
praier for the Church; 
O King of glory, Lorde of Hostes,
which hast triumphantly ascended into heaven, leave vs not
fatherlesse, but send the promised spirit of thy trueth amongest
vs.
 Some write that hee went to 
Rome,
 and interpreted
there 
S, P, Q, R,
 in derision of the 
Gothes
 swarming to

Reme, Stultus Populus Quaerit Roman:
 and that in his
returne hee died at 
Genoa,
 where they shew his toombe:
But certaine it is that he was sent for to 
Rome
 by 
Sergius

the Pope, and more certaine that hee died at 
Weremouth,

and from thence was translated to 
Durham:
 And that I
may incidently note that which I have heard: Not manie
yeeres since a French Bishop returning out of 
Scotland,

comming to the Church of 
Durham,
 and brought to the
shrine of Saint 
Cu
hbert,
 kneeled downe, and after his
devotions, offered a Baubie, saying; 
Sancte Cuthberte, si
sanctus si
, ora pro me:
 But afterward, being brought vnto
the Toombe of 
Bed
,
 saying likewise his Orisons, offered
there a French crowne with this alteration, 
Sancte Beda,
quia sanctus es, ora pro me.


Iohannes Erigena
 surnamed 
Scotus,
 a man renowned for
learning, sitting at the Table, in respect of his learning,
with 
Charles
 the bawld Emperour and King of 
Fraunce,



behaved himselfe as a slovenly Scholler, nothing Courtly;
whereupon the Emperour asked him merrily, 
Quid in∣terest
inter Scotum & Sotum;
 What is betweene a Scot
and a Sot? Hee merrily, but yet malapertly aunswered,

Mensa,
 The Table; as though the Emperour were the
Sot, and hee the Scot. [
Rog: Hovede
us,
]


On an other time the Emperour did serte downe vnto
him a dish with two faire great fishes, and one little one,
willing him to be carver vnto two other Schollers that fate
beneath him: Then Maister 
Iohn,
 who was but a little
man, layed the two great fishes vppon his owne trencher,
and set downe the one little fish vnto the other two Schol∣lers,
who were bigge men. Which when the Emperour
sawe, hee smiling saide; 
In good faith Maister Iohn, you
are no indifferent divider: Yes if it like your Highnesse, verie
indifferent
 (saide he) 
for heere
 (poynting to himselfe and
the two great fishes) 
be two great ones, and a little one, and
so yonder
 (reaching his hand towardes the Schollers) 
are
two great ones and a little one. Idem


Wenefridus 
borne at
 Kirton 
in Devonshire, after furna∣med

Boniface, 
who converted
 Freesel and 
to Christianitie,
was wont to say,
 In olde time there were golden Prelats, and
woodden Chalices, but in his time woodden Prelates, and gol∣den
Chalices. [Beatus Rhenanus libr. 2. rerum Germen
a∣rum.]


Ethelwold
 the Bishop of 
Winchester
 in the time of king

Edgar,
 in a great famine, solde away all the sacred golde
and silver vessells of all his church, to releeve the hunger∣starved
poore people, saying, 
That there was no reason that
the senselesse temples of God should abound in riches, and living
temples of the holy-ghost starve for hunger.


Whenas 
Kinnad
 King of 
Scot
 a vassall to King 
Eadgar

of 
England,
 had saide at his Table, 
That it stoode not with
the honour of the Princes of this Isle to be subiect to that Dan∣diprat
Eadgar,
 who was indeede but of small stature, yet
full of courage. He vnderstanding thereof withdrew 
Kin∣nad

privately into a wood, as though hee had to conferre


with him of some important secret; where he offered him
the choice of two swords, prepared for that purpose, with
these wordes, 
Now we are alone, you may try your manhood:
now may it appeare who should be subiect to the other: retire
not one foote backe: It standeth not with the honour of Princes
to brave it at the Table, and not to dare it in the field.
 But 
Ki∣nad

heere-at dismaied, desired pardon by excuse, and ob∣tained
it. [
Malmesburiensis pag.

The same king 
Eadgar,
 having brought into his subie∣ction
the aforesaid 
Kinnad
 king of 
Scottes, Malcolm
 king
of 
Cumberland, Mac cuis
 the arch pirate lord of the Isles,
with 
Dufnall, Griffith, Howell, Iacob, Iudethil
 Princes of

Wales,
 was rowed by them in triumphant manner in his
barge vpon the river of 
Dee
 at 
Chester,
 at which time it
is reported he saide; 
Then may my successours the Kings of
England glorie, when they shall doe the like. [Marianus Sco∣tus

When 
Hinguar

 came so sodainely vppon

Edmund
 the king of the 
East-Angles,
 that hee was forced
to seeke his safetie by flight, hee happened vnhappily on a
troupe of 
Danes,
 who fell to examining of him, whether
hee knew where the king of the 
East-Angles
 was, whome

Edmund
 thus answered; 
Even now when I was in the palace,
he was there, and when I went from thence, he departed thence,
and whether he shall escape your handes or no, onely God kno∣weth.

But so soone as they once heard him name God, the
godlesse infidells pittifully martired him. [

When 
Brithwold
 a noble Saxon marching against the

Maldon,
 was invited by the Abbot

Hee would not dine from his companies, because hee could not
fight without his companies. Liber Eliensis.


King 
Canutus,
 commonly called 
Knute,
 walking on the
sea sands neare to 
Southampton,
 was extolled by some of
his flattering followers, and tolde that hee was a king of
kings, the mightiest that raigned farre and neare, that both


sea and land were at his commaund: But this speach did
put the godly King in mind of the infinite power of God,
by whome Kings have and enioy their power, and there∣vpon
hee made this demonstration to refell their flatterie:
He tooke off his cloake, and wrapping it round together,
s
te downe vpon it neare to the sea, that then beganne to
slowe, saying, 
Sea, I commaund thee that thou touch not my
feete:
 
 he had not so soone spoken the worde, but the
surg
ng wave dashed him. He then rising vp, and going
backe, saide: 
Ye see now my Lorde, what good cause you have
to call me a King, that am not able by my commaundement to
stay one wave: no morta
l man doubtlesse is woorthy of such an

 name, no man hath such commaund, but one King, which
ruleth all: Let vs honour him, let vs call him King of all kings,
and Lord of all nations: Let vs not onely confesse, bvt also pr
∣fesse
him to be ruler of the heavens, sea, an
 land. [Polydorus

his bedde with the curtaine, drawne round about him, a
poore pilfering Courtier came into his chamber, where
finding the Kings Casket open, which 
Hugoline
 his cham∣berlaine
had forgotten to shut, going foorth to pay mo∣ney
in haste, hee tooke out so much money as hee could

well carry, and went away. But insatiable desire brought


him againe, and so the third time, when the King who lay
still all this while, and would not seeme to see, beganne to
speake to him, and bade him speedily be packing; 
For he
was well if hee coulde see, for if Hugoline came and tooke him
there, he were not onely like to loose all that he had gotten, but
also stretch an halter.
 The fellow was no sooner gone, but

Hugoline
 came in; and finding the Casket open, and much
money taken away, was greatly mooved: But the King
willed him not to he grieved, 
For
 (saide he) 
he that hath it
had more neede of it then wee have.
 This at that time was
adiudged Christian lenitie, but I thinke in our age it will
be accounted simplicitie in the woorst sense. [

This 
Edward
 hasted out of 
Normandie,
 whither his
expelled father king 
Ethelred
 had fled with him, with a
great power to recover the kingdome of 
England
 from
the Danes, neere vnto whose forces hee was encamped,
ready to give them battell: But when his Captaines pro∣mised
him assured victorie, and that they would not leave
one Dane alive: 
God forbid
 (quoth 
Edward,) that the king∣dome
should be recovered for me one man, by the death of so
many thousand men: It is better that I do leade a private and
vnbloody life, then be a King by such but chery:
 And there∣withall
brake vp Campe and retyred into 
Normandy,

where he staied vntill God sent oportunitie to obtaine the
kingdome without blood. [

Harold
 as hee waited on the cup of the said king 
Ed∣ward,

chanced to stumble with one foot that he almost
kissed the ground, but with the other legge he recovered
himselfe and saved the wine, whereat his father 
Godwyn

Earle of 
Kent,
 who then dined with the King, smiling sa
d:

Now one brother did helpe another:
 At this word, although
spoken proverbially, the Kings blood beganne to rise,
thinking how shamefully they had murdered his brother

The same king
 Edward 
passing out of this life, com∣mended
his wise to the Nobilitie, and said;
 That she had
carried her selfe as his wife abroad, but as his sister or daughter
at home: 
Afterward seeing such as were present weeping
and lamenting for him, he said;
 If you loved me, you would
for beare weeping and reioyce, because I go to my father, with
whom I shall receive the ioyes promised to the faithfull, not
through my merits, but by the free mercy of my Saviour,
which sheweth mercy on whom he pleaseth. [Eilredus Rival∣lensis]

 vnderstood that his sonne whom

In this age when a Bishop living loosely was charged

When the fatall period of the Saxon Empire was now
complete, and battells were marshalled betweene 
William

Duke of 
Normandy,
 and 
Harold
 King of 
England, Girthe
Haroldes
 yonger brother, not holding it best to hazard the
kingdome of 
England
 at one cast, signified to the King,
that the succ

swayed rather by fortune than by valour, that advised de∣lay
was most important in Martiall affaires, and if so bee


brother (said he,) 
You have plighted your faith to the Duke,
retyre your selfe, for no force can serve against a mans owne
conscience, God will revenge the violation of an 
the: You may
reserve your selfe to give them a new encounter, which will be
more to their terrour: As for me, if you will commit the charge
to me, I will performe both the part of a kinde brother, and a
couragious Leader. For being cleare in conscience, I shall sell
my life, or discomfit your enemy with more felicitie.


But the King not liking his speech, answered:
 I will ne∣ver
turne my backe with dishonour to the Norman, neither
can I in any sort disgest the reproach of a base minde: Wel, then
be it so, (
said some discontented of the company,
) let him

VVIlliam Conquerour
 when he invaded this Iland,
chanced at his arrivall to be graveled, and one of
his feete stacke so fast in the sand, that he fell to the ground.
Wherewithall one of his attendants caught him by the
arme and helped him vp, saying: 
Stand vp my 
iege Lord
and be of good cheare, for now you have taken fast footing in

England: and then espying that he brought vp sand and
earth in his hand, added: 
Yea and you have taken livery and

 For you know that in delivering of
livery and seisin, a peece of the earth is taken. [

A Wizard, (or a Wise-man as they then called them,)
had fore-told 
William
 that he should safely arrive an 
Eng∣land

with his whole Armie, without any impeachment of
Harold: the which after it came it passe, the King sent for
the Wizard to conferre further with him. But when it was
told him that he was drowned in that ship which onely of
all the whole fleete miscarried, The Conquerour said: 
He
would never make account of that science that profited more
the ignorant then the skilfull therein, for he could fore-see my
good fortune, but not his owne mishap. [Idem.
]



That morning that he was to ioyne battell with 
Harold,

his atmorer put on his backe-peece before, and his breast∣plate
behinde, the which being espied by some that stood
by, was taken on them for an ill token, and therefore ad∣vised
him not to fight that day; to whom the Duke answe∣red:

I force not of such fooleries, but if I have any skill 

South-saying, (as in sooth I have none,) it doth prognosticate
that I shall change copie from a Duke to a King. [Idem.]


Magike in the time of

 was discovered to be but
a vanitie, in the declining state of the Roman Empire ac∣counted

(if we beleeve Authors,) so approoved that it was com∣monly
practised: For as in the time of 
Vale

 divers curi∣ous
men (as hath beene said,) by the falling of a ring Ma∣gically
prepared vpon the letters 
, iudged that one

Theodorus
 should succeede in the Empire, when indeede

Theodosius

 was Pope, by like cu∣riosities
it was found that

 should succcede. Wherevp∣pon

Odo
 Earle of

 for his presumption, and other his misde∣menours
staied him, and committed him, saying:

 dishonesty.



This King 
William,
 by reason of sickenes, kept his
chamber a long time, whereat the French King scoffing
saide: 
The King of England heth long in childe-bed.
 Which
when it was reported vnto King 
William,
 hee aunswered;

When I am churched there shal be a thousand lights in France:

(alluding to the lights that women vsed to beare when
they were churched,) and that hee performed within few
dayes after, wasting the French frontires with fire and
sword.


The same King at the time of his death, saide;

 successour in the kingdome of England, but I commend it to
the eternall God, whose I am, and in whose handes all thinges
are:

This king perceiving his owne defects, in some poynts,
for want of learning, did exhort his children oftentimes
to learning with this saying, 
An vnlearned Prince is a crow∣ned

surname of

Monkes were at drop-vied 
Bezantines
 (the currant golde
of that age) before him for an Abbey, hee espied a third
Monke of their company standing in a corner, whom the
King asked, what hee would give to be Abbot? 
Not one
farthing

for I renounced the world and riches, that
I might serve God more sincerely. Then
 (said the King) 
thou
arte most woorthy to be made Abbot, and thou shalt have it.

When newes were brought him that the French King

Normandy,
 
e po∣sted
with a few to the sea coast, to take ship. But because
the winde blew very strong from South, the sailers signi∣fied,
that it was very dangerous for him to take Sea, but
the King replied, 
Hoise vp sailes in Gods name, for I have
not heard of a King drowned by tempest: You shall see both
winde and weather serviceable to vs.
 Answerable to that of

Iulius Caesar,
 which inforced a poore Pilote in the like case

I will heere present you with an other speech (or call
it what you will) of the same King 
William Rufus,
 out of
the good and historicall Poet 
Robert
 of 
Glocester,
 that you
may compare a Princes pride in that age, with our private
pride, and that our first finest Poets may smile at the ver∣ses
of that time, as succeeding ages, after some hundred
yeeres will happly smile at theirs:

As his Chamberlaine him brought, as he rose on a day.


A morrow for to weare, a paire of hose of Say:


He asked what they costned, three shillings he seid,


Fie a dibles quoth the King, who sey so vile a deede:


King to weare so vile a cloth, but it costned more,


Buy a paire for a marke, or thou shalt ha cory f
re.


A worse paire enough, the other swith him brought,


And said they costned a marke, & vnneth he them so boght:


Aye bel-amy, quoth the King, these were well bought,


In this manner serve me, other ne serve me not.


Hitherto also may be referred that of this king 
William,

who the morning before hee was slaine with an arrow in


hunting, tolde his company he dreamed the last night be∣fore,
that an extreame cold winde passed throgh his sides:
whereupon some disswaded him to hunt that day, but hee
resolved to the contrary answering. 
They are no good Chri∣stians
that regard dreames.
 But he found the dreame too
true, being shot through the side by 
Walter Tirell. [Trag∣mentum

OF 
Henry
 the first I have read no memorable speach,
but what I have read I will report. He was by com∣mon
voice of the people commended for his wisedome, e∣loquence,
and victories, dispraised for covetousnes, cruel∣ty,
and lechery: Of which hee left proofe by his sixteene
bastards. But it seemeth that his iustice was deemed by the
common people to be crueltie, for the learned of that age
surnamed him the 
Lion of Iustice, [Huntingd. Polycraticon,

It was the custome of the Court in the time of King

Henry
 the first, that bookes, billes, and letters shoulde be
drawne, and signed for servitors in the Court, concerning
their owne matters, without fee. But at this time 
Turstane

the kings steward, or 
Le Despencer,
 as they then called him,
from whom the family of the L. 
Spencers
 came, exhibited
to the king a complaint, against 
Adam
 of 
Yarmouth
 clarke
of the Signet, for that he refused to signe without fee, a bill
passed for him. The king first heard 
Turstane,
 commend∣ing
the olde custome at large, and charging the Clarke for
exacting somewhat contrary thereunto, for passing his
booke. Then the Clarke was heard, who briefly saide, I
received the Booke, and sent vnto your steward, desiring
him only to bestow of me two spice cakes,
 made for your
owne mouth, who returned answer; He would not, and
thereupon I denied to seale his Booke. The King great∣ly
disliked the steward for returning that negative, and
forthwith made 
Adam
 sit downe vppon the bench, with


the seale and 
Turstanes
 Booke before him, but compelled
the steward to put off his cloake, to fetch two of the best
spice cakes for the kings owne mouth, to bring them in a
faire white napkin, and wi
h lowe curtsie to present them
to 
Adam
 th
 C
arke; which being accordingly performed,

ded

 his Chamberlaine, and the Pa∣ges

were not allowance for livery: hee humbly answered that
there was a pottle allowed everie night, but for that hee
never called for it (to say the trueth in hope of pardon) wee
drunke it vp amongst v
; Then (quoth the King) have
you but one pottle every night? that is too shorte for mee
and you, from hencefoorth there shall be a whole gallon
allowed, whereof the one pottle shall be for mee, the o∣ther
for you and yours. This I note, not for anie gravi

 All the members of the body conspired against
the stomacke, as against the swallowing gulfe of all their labors;
for whereas the eies beheld, the eares heard, the handes labo∣red,
the feete traveled, the tongue spake, and all partes perfor∣meds
their functions, onely the stomacke lay ydle and consumed
all. Hereuppon they ioyntly agreed al to forbeare their labors,
and to pine away their lasie and publike enemy. One day passed
over, the second followed very tedious, but the third day was
so grievous to them all, that they called a common Counsel; The
eyes waxed d
mme, the feete could not support the body, the
armes waxed lasie, the tongue faltered, and could not lay open
the matter; Therefore they all with one accord desired the ad∣vise
of the Heart. There Reason layd open before them, that

ee against whome they had proclaimed warres, was the cause
of all this their misery: For he as their common steward, when
his allowances were withdrawne, of necessitie withdrew theirs
fro them, as not receiving that he might allow. Therfore it were
a farre better course to supply him, than that the limbs should
faint with hunger. So by the perswasion of Reason, the stomacke
was served, the limbes comforted, and peace re-established.
Even so it fareth with the bodies of Common-weales; for albeit
the Princes gather much, yet not so much for themselves, as for
others: So that if they want, they cannot supply the want of o∣thers;
therefore do not repine at Princes heerein, but respect
the common good of the whole publike estate. [Idem.


Oftentimes would he say,
 All his preferments never ad∣ded


any one iote to his happinesse or quietnesse. [Idem.


He also (that I may omitte other of his speeches) would
say,
 The Lord hath dilated me by hammering me vpon the an∣vild;
but I beseech him he would vnderlay his hand to the vn∣supportable
burthen which he hath layde vpon me. [Idem.


When it was signified vnto king 
Richard
 the first, son
to the foresaide King 
Henry
 sitting at supper in his pallace
at 
Westminster
 (which we call the old pallace now) that the
French king besieged his towne of 
Vernoil
 in 
Normandie:

he in greatnes of courage protested in these wordes, 
I will
never turne my backe vntil I have confronted the French:
 For
performance of which his princely word, hee caused the
wall in his pallace at 
Westminster
 to be broken downe di∣rectly
towardes the South, posted to the coast, and imme∣diately
into 
Normandie,
 where the very report of his so∣daine
arrivall, so terrified the French, that they raised the
siege, and retired themselves. [
Ypodigma.


The same king 
Richard
 purposing an expedition into
the holy land, made money at all handes, and amongst o∣ther
things solde vnto 
Hugh Pudsey
 Bishop of 
Durham
 the
Earledome of 
Northumberland,
 merrily laughing when he
invested him, and saying; 
Am not I cunning, and my crafies∣maister,
that can make a yoong Earle of an olde Bishoppe?

But this Prelate was fitte to be an Earle, for the worlde (as
one of that age saide of him) 
was not crucifixus to him, but
infixus in him. [Lib. Dunelm.


One 
Fulke
 a Frenchman of great opinion for his holi∣nesse
tolde this king 
Richard
 that hee kept with him three
daughters, that would procure him the wrath of God, if
he did not shortly ridde himselfe of them. 
Why hypocrite

(quoth the king) 
all the worlde knoweth that I never hadde
childe, Yea
 (saide 
Fulke) you have as I saide, three; and their
names are Pride, Covetousnesse, and Lechery. (It is so
 (saide
the king) 
you shal see me presently bestow them: the Knightes


Templers shal have Pride, the while M
nkes Covetousnesse,
and the Cleargy Lechery; and there have you my three daugh∣ters
bestowed among you.


When there was a faire opportunitie offered vnto this
king 
Richard,
 and to 
Hugh
 duke of 
Burgundie
 for the sur∣prise
of 
Ierusalem,
 they marched forward in two battalles
from 
Acres.
 The king of 
England
 led the first, the Duke
of 
Burgundie
 the other; when they approched, the Duke
of 
Burgundie
 envying the glory of the English, signified to
the king of 
England,
 that he would retire with his compa∣nies,
because it should not be said, that the English had ta∣ken

Ierusalem.
 While this message was delivering, and
the King grieving that so glorious an enterprise was so o∣verthwarted
by envie; one amongest the English compa∣nies
cryed alowde to the King and said, 
Sir, S
r, come hither
and I will shew you Ierusalem.
 But king 
Richard
 cast his
coate of armes before his face, and weeping vttered these
wordes with alowde voice; 
Ah my Lord God, I beseech thee
that I may not see thy holy Cittie Ierusalem, whenas I am not
able to deliver it out of the handes of the enemies. [Ian Sire
Signour de Ionville
 in the life of Saint 
Le wes. cap.
 70. This
Author also giveth this testimony of the saide king, in the
eight chapter of the saide Booke. 
This Prince was of such
prowesse, that he was more feared and redoubted amongest the
Sarazens then ever was any Prince Christian. Insomuch that
when as their little infants beganne to crie, their mothers would
say to make them holde their peace; King Richard commeth,
and wil have you, and immediately the little children hearing
him named, would forbeare crying:
 And likewise the 
Turkes

and 
Sarazens,
 when their horses at any time started, they
woulde putte spurre to them and say; 
What you iades, you
thinke King Richard is heere?


When the same king 
Richard
 had fortunately taken in
a skirmish, 
Philippe
 the Bishop of 
Beavoys
 a deadly enemy
of his, hee cast him in prison with boltes vpon his heeles,
which being complained of vnto the Pope, he wrote ear∣nestly
vnto him, not to detaine his deere sonne, an Eccle∣siasticall


person, and a sheepheard of the Lordes, but to
send him backe vnto his flocke. Whereuppon the King
sent vnto the Pope the armour that he was taken in, and
willed his Ambassadour to vse the words of 
Iacobs
 sonnes
vnto their father, when they had solde away their brother

Ioseph, Hanc invenimus, vide vtrum tunica filij tui sit, an 

This wee found, see whether it be the coate of thy sonne, or no.
Nay
 (quoth the Pope) 
it is not the coate of my sonne, nor of my
brother, but some impe of
 Mars, 
and let him procure his deli∣verie
of he will, for I wil be no meane for him.


When the French king and king 
Richard
 the first be∣ganne
to parlee of peace, his brother 
Iohn,
 who had false∣ly
and vnnaturally revolted vnto the French king, fearing
himselfe, came in of his owne accord, and suppliantly be∣sought

Richard
 brotherly to pardon his manifolde offen∣ces,
that he had vnbrotherly committed against him, hee
rehersed the straight league of brotherly piety, he recoun∣ted
the many merits of his brother, he bewailed with teares
that hitherto he had beene vnmindefull of them, as an vn∣naturall
and vnthankefull person. Finally, that hee dooth
live, and shall live, hee dooth acknowledge that hee hath
received it at his handes. The king being mollified with
this humble submission, saide: 
God graunt that I may as ea∣sily
forget your offences, as you may remember wherein you
have offended.


IN the wofull warres with the Barons, when king 
Iohn

was viewing of the Castle of 
Rochester
 held against him
by the Earle of 
Arundel,
 he was espied by a very good Ar∣cubalister,
who tolde the Earle thereof, and saide, that hee
would soone dispatch the cruell tyrant, if he would but say
the word; 
God forbid, vile varlet
 (quoth the Earle) 
that we
should procure the death of the holy one of God.
 What (saide
the souldier) he would not spare you if hee had you at the
like advantage. 
No matter for that
 (quoth the Earle) 
Gods


good wil be done, and be wil dispose, and not the King.
[Math: Paris.


When one about him shewed him where a noble man,
that had rebelliously borne armes against him, lay verie
honourably intoombed, and advised the king to deface the
monument, he said; 
No, no, but I would al the rest of mine e∣nemies
were as honourably buried. [Idem.


When diverse Greekes came hither, and offered to
proove that there were cettaine 
rrours in the Church of

England
 at that time, hee reiected them, saying, 
I will not
suffer our faith established to be called in question with doubt∣ful
disputations. [Fragm: antiquum aeditum à P. Pithaeo.


Yet when the saide king 
Iohn
 sawe a fatie Bucke haun∣ched,

See how faire and fatte this

 But
this may be forged to his disgrace by the envious. [

IN a solemne conference betweene king 
Henry
 the third
of 
England,
 and Saint 
Lewes
 king of 
France,
 the onely
devout kings of that age, when the French king saide, He
had rather heare Sermons, than heare Masses. Our king
replied, which some will smile at now, but according to
the learning of that time, That he had rather see his loving
friend (meaning the reall presence in the Sacrament) than
to heare never so much good of him, by others in sermons.
This I note, because it was then thought facetious, which
I doubt not but some wil now condemne as superstitious

at 
Chastilion,
 farre from cowardly f
are of death, and fa∣therly
affected to his sonne the Lorde

 who woulde
not forsake him in that danger, advised him to f

My death in respect of my former exploites can not be but ho∣nourable;
and in respect of thy youth, neither can it be honou∣rable
for thee to die, nor dishonourable to f

 But this yong
Lord in height of courage, nothing degenerating from so

After this battell, when the flames of inward warre be∣ganne
to flash out in 
England,
 the martiall men of 
England

were called home out of 
Fraunce,
 to maintaine the factions
heere: at which time a French Captaine scoffingly asked
an English-man when they woulde returne againe into

Fraunce.
 He answered feelingly, and vpon a true ground:

When your sinnes shal be greater and more grievous in the sight
of God, than ours are now.


¶Vntill this time, from the beginning of King 
Ed∣ward

the first, which was about an hundred and sixtie
yeeres, whosoever will with a marking eie consider the
comportment of the English Nation, the concurrent of
martiall men, their Councells, military discipline, designs,
actions, and exploites, not onely out of our owne Wri∣ters,
but also forraine Historians; cannot but acknowledge,
that they were men of especiall worth, and their prowesse
both great and glorious. Why afterward it should decay,
as all other professions, which even like plants have their
times of beginning or in-rooting, their growing vp, their


flourishing, their maturitie, and than these fading, were
a disquisition for the learned. Whether it proceedeth
from celestiall influence, or those Angelles which 
Plato

makes, or the 
Secundei
 which 
Trith
ius
 imagined to have
the regiment of the world successively, or from the dege∣nerating
of numbers into summes, which I confesse I vn∣derstand
not, being an ignorant in abstruse learning. One∣ly
I have read in 
Paterculus,
 that when either envie, or ad∣miration
hath given m
n an edge to ascend to the highest,
and when they can ascend no higher, after a while they
must naturally descend. Yet I relie vpon that of 
Eccclesia∣stes,

as I vnderstand it, 
Cuncta fecit bona in tempore su
 De∣us,
& mundum tradidit disputationi eorum, vt non inveni∣at
home quod operatus est Deus ab initio vsque ad finem.
 But
pardon mee, I cannot tell how I have beene by admirati∣on
of our Progenitours diverted from my purpose.


In the yeere of our Lord 1416. when a fifteene hun∣dred
English vnder the cōduct of 
I: Beaufort
 erle of 
Der∣set

were encompassed betweene the sea, and fifteen thou∣sand
French. The Erle of 
Arminac
 generall of the French,
sent to the Earle, advising him to yeelde himselfe, but hee
answered, 
It is not the manner of the English, to yeelde with∣out
blowes, neither am I so heartlesse that I will deliver my
selfe into their handes, whom God 
ay deliver into mine.
 And
accordingly God gave him the honour of the day, to the
great confusion of the enemy. [
Walsingham in Ypodig∣mate.


VVHen 
Elizabeth
 the widow of sir 
Iohn Gray
 was a
suter vnto King 
Edward
 the fourth (against
whome her husband lost his life) for her ioynture: the
kinde King became also a suter to her vnto her for a nights
lodging: But she wisely answered him, when hee became
importunate, 
That as she did account her selfe too base to be
his wife, so shee did thinke her selfe too good to be his 
.



When love grew so hote in this K. 
Edward
 the fourth,
that hee would needes marry the saide 
Elizabeth,
 widow
of sir 
Iohn Grey,
 to the great discontent of his Counsell, but
especially of his mother, who alleaging many reasons to the
contrary, saide, That onely widowhood might be suffici∣ent
to restraine him, for that it was high disparagement to
a King, to be dishonoured with bigamy in his first mar∣riage.
The King merrily aunswered; 
In that shee is a wid∣dow,
and hath already children; by Gods blessed Lady I am a
batcheller, and have some too: and so each of vs hath a proofe,
that neither of vs are like to be barren. And therefore Ma∣dam,
I pray you be content, I trust in God she shal bring you forth
a yong Prince; that shall please you. And as for the bigamy, let
the Bishop hardly lay it in my way when I come to take Orders:
for I vnderstand it is forbidden to a Priest, but I never wist it
yet that it was forbidden to a Prince.


His note love neverthelesse was partable among three
other of his Mistresses, of whome hee was woont to say,

The one was the fairest, the other the merriest, and the third
the holiest, for she had wholy devoted her selfe to his bedde and
her beades.


When 
Lewes
 the eleaventh French King entertained
diverse Councellors of king 
Edward
 the fourth with large
pensions to steede him in 
England,
 hee sent 
Peter Cleret

one of the maisters of his housholde vnto the Lorde 
Ha∣stings

the Kings Chamberlaine, to present him with twoo
thousand crownes. Which when he had received, 
Petre
Cleret
 did pray him, that for his discharge he would make
him an acquittance; The Lorde Chamberlaine made a
great difficultie thereat. Then 
Cleret
 dooth request him
againe that hee would give vnto him onely a letter of three
lines for his discharge to the King, signifying that hee had
received them. The Lord Chamberlaine answered; 
Sir,
that which you say is very reasonable; but the gift comes from
the goodwill of the King your Maister, and not at my request
at all: If it please you that I shall have it, you shall put it within
the pocket of my sleeve, and you shall have no other acquittance


of me. For I will never it shalbe saide for mee, that the Lorde
Chamberlaine of the King of England had beene Pentioner to
the King of Fraunce: Nor that my acquittances shal be found
in the Chamber of accompts in Fraunce.
 The afores
id 
Cle∣ret

went away male-content, but left his money with him,
and came to tell his message to his King, who was very
angry with him. But thenceforth the Lord Chamberlaine
of 
England
 was more esteemed with the French, and al∣wayes
payde without acquittance. [

KIng 
Richard
 the third, whose monstrous birth fore∣shewed
his monstrous proceedings, for he was born
with all his teeth, and haire to his shoulders, albeit hee li∣ved
wickedly, yet made good Lawes, and when diverse
shires of 
England
 offered him a benevolence, hee refused
it, saying, I know not in what sence; 
I haa rather have
your hearts, than your money. [Ioannes Rossus Warwiceu∣sis.
]


Iohn Morton 
then Bishoppe of
 Elie, 
but afterward of

Canterbury, 
being solicited by the Duke of
 Buckingham

then alienated from
 Richard 
the third, to speake his minde
frankely vnto him, in matters of State: the Bishoppe aun∣swered
him;
 In good faith my Lord I love not much to talke
with Princes, as a thing not all out of perill, although the words
be without fault. Forasmuch as it shall not be taken as the par∣tie
meant it, but as it pleaseth the Prince to construe it. And
ever I thinke on Aesopes tale, that when the Lien had pro∣claimed,
that on paine of death, there should no horned beast
abide in that wood, one that had in his forehead a bounch of
flesh, fledde away a great pase. The Foxe that sawe him ruune
so fast, asked him whither he made all that haste: hee answe∣red;
In faith I neither wote nor recke, so I were once hence, be∣cause
of this proclamation made of horned beasts. What fo
le
(quoth the Foxe) thou mayest well enough abide, the Lion


meant not by thee, for it is no horne that is vppon thy head: No
Mary (quoth hee) that wote I well enough, but what and hee
call it an horne, where am I then? [Tho: Moore.


Sir
 Thomas Rokesby 
being controlde for suffering him∣selfe
to be served in treene Cuppes, answered;
 These home∣lie
cuppes and dishes pay truly for that they containe: I had ra∣ther
drinke out of treene, and pay golde and silver, than drinke
out of golde and silver, and make woodden payment.


VVHen 
Richard
 the third was slain at 
Bosworth,
 and
with him 
Iohn Howard
 Duke of 
Norffolke,
 King

Henry
 the seaventh demaunded of 
Thomas Howard
 Earle
of 
Surrey
 the Dukes sonne and heire then taken prisoner,
how he d
rst beare Armes in the behalfe of that tyranne

Richard.
 He answered; 
He was my crowned King, and if the
Parliamentary authority of England sette the Crowne vppon a
stocke, I will fight for that stocke. And as I fought then for him,
I wi
 fight for you, when you are established by the said authori∣tie.

And so hee did for his sonne King 
Henry
 the eight at

Flodden
 field.

When 
Margaret
 the widdow of 
Charles
 the Hardie
Duke of 
Bargundie,
 and sister to king 
Edward
 the fourth,
envying much the happy estate and raigne of 
Henry
 the
seaventh descended of the adverse family of 
Lancaster,
 had
at sundry times suborned two rascalles to counterfeit
the persons of her two brothers sonnes, thereby to with∣drawe
the hearts of his subiects, and raise vproares in his
realme, the king sent over vnto 
Philippe
 the Duke of 
Bur∣gundie

doctour 
Warrham
 afterward Archbishop of 
Can∣terbury,

to informe him of her treachery. This Doctour
in the latter 
d of his Oration thus nipped the seditious
Dutchesse 
That within few yeeres after shee was past three∣score
yeeres of age, she had brought foorth two monsters,
 Lam∣bert

and
 Peter, 
and not in the nine and tenth moneths, as wo∣men
naturally doe, but in the hundred and fourescore moneth,


(for they were both about fifteene yeeres of age when shee
brought them abroade, as it were, out of her belly:) neither
were they Crisomers, but such childe-choppers, that as soone
as ever they were borne, they were able to wage warre with a
mighty King. [Th: More.


The earle of 
Kildare
 being charged before king 
Henry

the seaventh for burning the Metropolitane Church of

Cassilles
 in 
Ireland,
 and many witnesses procured to a∣vouch
the trueth of the Article against him, hee sodainely
confessed it to the great wondring and detestation of the
Counsell. Then it was looked how he should iustifie that
fact. 
By Iesus
 (quoth hee) 
I would never have done it, if it
had not beene tolde me that the Archbishop had beene within
it.
 And because the Bishop was one of the busiest accu∣sers
present, merrily laughed the king at the plainnesse of
the man, to see him alledge that intent for excuse, which
most of all did aggravate his fault.


When among many articles the last article exhibited
by the Irish against that Earle of 
Kildare,
 the last was: Fi∣nally,

All Ireland cannot rule this Earle. Then
 (quoth the
King) 
shall this Earle rule all Ireland;
 and shortly after hee
made him Deputie thereof.


When one reprooved King 
Henry
 the seaventh for his
slownesse in making warres on those that wronged him,
he answered, 
If we Princes should take every occasion that is
offered vs, the worlde should never be quiet, but wearied with
continuall warres.


When a Gentleman, none of the wisest, tolde King

Henry
 the seaventh, that hee found sir 
Richard Gr
ftes,

who was made Banneret at the battell of 
Stoke
 to be a ve∣ry
wise man. The King answered, 
Hee doubted not that,
but marvelled much how a foole could knowe a wiseman.


It h
ppened that there was fallen in communication
the story of 
Ioseph,
 how his maister 
Putiphars
 wife a great
m
n with the King of 
Aegipt,
 would have pulled him to

e
b
d 
n
 he fled away. 
Now Maister M
o
 (hee was
the 
King
 Almoner) quoth king 
Henry
 the seaventh, 
You


be a tall strong man on the one side, and a cunning Doctor on
the other side, what would you have done, if you had not beene
Ioseph, but in Iosephs steade? By my troth fir
 (quoth he) 
and
it like your Grace, I cannot tell what I would have done, but I
can tell you what I should have done. [Tho: Moore.


The Lady
 Margaret 
Countesse of
 Richmond 
mother
to king
 Henry 
the seaventh, a most worthy Patronesse of
good Letters, would often say,
 On the condition that Princes
of Christendome would combine themselves, and march against
the common enemy the Turke, shee would most wil
ingly attend
them, and be their Laundresse in the campe.


There was a poore blind man in Warwick-shire, that
was accounted verie cunning in prognosticating of wea∣ther:
vpon a day, 
Empson
 a great lawier, as hee road that
way, sayd in scorne of his cunning. I pray you tell me father
when doth the Sunne change? The chafed old man that
knew his corrupt conscience, answered: when such a wic∣ked
Lawier as you goeth to heauen.


Doctor 
Collet
 the Deane of 
Paules
 said, that if the Cler∣gie
were naught, the Laitie were worse, for it could not o∣therwise
be, but the laye men must ever be one degree vn∣der
the Clergie: for surely it can be no 
 that our Sauiour
sayth himselfe, who sayth of the Cleargie, that they be the
salt of the earth, and if the salt once appall, the world must
needes waxe vnsauerie: and he sayeth that the Clergie bee
the light of the world; and then sayeth he, if the light bee
darkened, how darke will then the darkenesse be? that is to
wit, all the world beside, whereof he calleth the Clergie
onely the light.


Cardinall 
Wolsey,
 his teeth watering at the rich Bishop∣ricke
of 
Winchester,
 sent one vnto Bishop 
Foxe
 (who had
advaunced him vnto the kings service) for to move him to
resigne the Bishopricke, because extreame age had made
him blind: the which message and motion 
Foxe
 did take
in so ill part, that he willed the messenger to tell the Cardi∣nall
thus from him: that although olde age bereaving me
of sight, I know not white from blacke, yet I can discerne


truth from falshoode, and right from wrong: yea, and that
now I am blind I haue esp
ed his malicious vnthankful∣nesse:
the which I could never before perceive when my
e
e sight was at the best. And let my lord Cardinall take
heede, that his ambition and covetousnesse, bring him not
into a worse blindnesse then I have, and make him fall be∣fore
he feare.


At sir 
Thomas Moore
 his first comming to the service of
King 
Henrie
 the eight the King gave him this godly les∣son.
First looke vnto God, and after vnto me.


He would also wish, as I have heard of an ancient man
of that age, that his Councellers would commit simulation,
dissimulation, and part
litie, to the Porters lodge, when
they came to sit in councell.


The same King 
Henrie
 the eight, finding fault with the
disagreement of Preachers, would often say; 
Some are too
stiffe in their olde
 Mumpsimus, and other to busie and cu∣rious
in their new 
Sumpsimus.
 Happly borrowing these
phrases from that which Master 
Pace
 his Secretarie repor∣teth
in his booke 
De Fructu doctrinae,
 of an old Priest in
that age, which alwayes read in his Portasse, 
Mumpsimus
Domine,
 for 
Sumsimus:
 whereof when he was admonished,
he said that he now had vsed 
Mumplimus
 thirtie yeares, and
would not leave his olde 
Mumpsimus
 for their new 
Sump∣simus.


A noble man of this time, in contempt of learning sayd,
that it was for noble mens sonnes enough to winde their
horne, and carrie their Hauke faire, and to leave studie and
learning to the children of mean men. To whom the fore∣saide

Richard Pace
 replied. 
Then you and other noble men
must be content, that your children may wind their bornes, and
keepe their Haukes while the children of meane men do manage
matters of estate [R. Pacaeus De fructu doctrinae.

Iohn Fisher
 Bishop of 
Rochester,
 when the King would
have translated him from that poore Bishopricke to a bet∣ter,
he refused, saying: 
He would not forsake his poore little
olde wife, with whom he had so long lived.
 Happly thinking


of the fifteenth canon of the 
Nicone Councell,
 and that of
the 
Canonistes, Matrimonium inter Episcopum, & Ecclesiam
esse contractum, &c.


There was a Nobleman merry conceited, aud 
iotously
given, that having lately sold a Mannor of an hundred te∣nements,
came ruffling into the Court, in a new sute, say∣ing:

Am not I a mightie man, that beare an hundred houses
on my backe?
 Which Cardinall 
Wolsey
 hearing, said: 
You
might have better employed it in paying your debts. Indeede
my Lord
 (quoth he) 
you say wel; for my Lord my father, owde
my maister your father three half pence for a Calfs head, hold,
here is two pence for it.
 As 
Skelton
 iested at the Cardinal, that
he was descended of 
Sanguil
er,
 hee was cast out of a But∣chers
stall, for his father was a Butcher of 
Ipswich.


When 
Stephen Cardiner
 was advaunced vnto the Bi∣shopricke
of 
Winchester,
 and sent over as Ambassadour
into 
Fraunce
 with great pomp
 hee saide vnto an old ac∣quaintance
of his that came to take his leave of him; 
Nowe
I am in 
 Gloria Patri: Yea
 (saide his friend) 
and I hope, 
t
nunc & semper. Or
 (replied the Bishop) 
if it please the king
my maister, Sicut erat in principio. A poore Scholler of Cam∣bridge
againe.


When sir 
Thomas, Moore
 was Speaker of the Parlia∣ment,
with his wis
dome and eloquence, hee so crossed
a purpose of Cardinall 
Wolsey
 that the Cardinall in a chafe
sent for him 
 
White-Hall;
 where when he had daunced
attendaunce long, at length the Cardinall comming out,
saide in the presence of many; 
Maister Moore, I woulde
you had beene at Rome, when you were made Speaker of the
Parliament house.
 Hee immediately replied: 
And if it
pleased your Grace, so would I, for then I should have seene a
famous Cittie, whereof I have heard much, but never sawe.
[Vita Tho: Mori impressa.


The same cardinal at a ful Counsel table, when sir 
Th

Moore
 was first made privie Counseller, moved that there
might be a Lievteuant generall of the Realme chosen for
certaine considerations; and the body of the Counsell in∣clined


thereunto. Sir 
Thomas Moore
 opposed himselfe.
Whereuppon the Cardinall in a chafe saide; 
Are not you a∣shamed
who are the meanest man heere, to dissent from so many
honourable and wise personages: you proove your selfe a plaine
foole.
 Whereunto maister 
Moore
 foorthwith aunswered;

Thankes be to God that the Kings maiestie hath but one foole
in his right honourable Counsell. [Idem.


When hee was Lorde Chauncellour, hee inioyned a
Gentleman to pay a good round summe of money vnto a
poore widdowe whome he had oppressed; and the Gen∣tleman
saide: 
Then I doe hope your Lordeship will give mee a
good long day to pay it. You shall have your request
 (saide sir

Thomas) Munday next is Saint Barnabas day, the longest day
in all the yeere, pay her mee then, or else you shall kisse the
Fleete.


When hee had no lust to growe greatly vpward in the
worlde, neyther would labour for office of authoritie, and
over that, forsake a right worshipfull roome when it was
offered him, his wife fell in hand with him, and asked him;
What will you do that you list not to put foorth your selfe
as others doe? Will you sit still by the fire, and make gose∣lings
in the ashes with a sticke, as children doe? Woulde
God I were a man, and looke what I would doe. What?
By God goe forward with the best; for as my mother was
wont to say, It is ever more better to rule than to be ruled,
and therefore I warrant you, I would not be so foolish to
be ruled, where I might rule. 
By my trueth wife
 (quoth
he) 
I dare say you say trueth, for I never found you willing to
be ruled yet.


He vsed, when hee was Lord Chauncellor, vpon every
Sonday, when he was at home, to sitte in the Quire in his
surplice and sing the Service: and being one day espied in
that attire by the Duke of 
Norffolke.
 The Duke beganne
to chafe, crying, Fie, fie, my Lorde, the Lord Chauncel∣lour
of England a parish priest, and a paltrie singing man,
you dishonour the King, you dishonour the King. 
No my
Lord
 (quoth sir 
Thomas) it is no shame for the King, if his


servant serve his Soveraigne and Saviour, who is King of
kings.


During the time of his Chancellourship of England, he
vsed to send his Gentleman-Vsher to his wifes pew, after
divine service was done, to tell her that he was gone: but
the next Sonday after hee gave vp his Chancellourship of
England, he came himselfe to her pew, and vsed the vsuall
words of his Gentleman-Vsher, 
Madame, my Lorde is
gone.


His latter wife was a widdow, of whom 
Erasmus
 wri∣teth,
that hee was wont to say, that shee was, 
nec bella, nec
puella:
 who as shee was a good huswife, so was shee not
voyde of the fault that often followeth that vertue, some∣what
shrewd to her servants: Vppon a time sir 
Thomas

found fault with her continuall ch
ding, saying; if that no∣thing
else would reclame her, yet the consideration of the
time (for it was Lent) should restraine her. 
Tush, tush, my
Lord
 (saide shee) 
looke, heere is one steppe to heaven-ward,

shewing him a Friers girdle. 
I feare mee
 (quoth sir 
Tho∣mas
Moore) this one steppe will not bring you vppe a steppe
higher.


One day when shee came from shrift, shee saide mer∣rily
vnto him, Be merry sir 
Thomas,
 for this day was I
well shriven, I thanke God, and purpose now therefore
to leave off all my olde shrewdnesse; 
Yea
 (quoth hee) 
and
to beginne afresh.


When he was sent prisoner vnto the Tower, and the
Lievtenant, his olde friend, received him with a heavy
cheere, hee sayde; 
Is this the entertainement and good coun∣tenance
you give your guests when they come to you? Why looke
man, heere are twenty angell nobles (shewing him his purse)
and when this is spent, turne me out at doores, as a bare game∣ster,
and not able to pay for that he takes.
 Hitherto may bee
referred his silent answere, when at his entring into the
Tower, one of the Officers claimed for a fee, his vp∣per
garment, (meaning his gowne or his cloke) he offred
him his cappe.



Being asked after his condemnation, and before his ex∣ecution,
whether hee had changed his minde, hee saide:

Yea, for I thought to have beene shaven, but now seeing I shall
die so shortly, I will let my beard growe.


His daughter
 Roper 
one day as shee repaired vnto him
into the Tower, counselled him to recover the Kings fa∣vour,
and his owne former libertie, by doing I know not
what, the which shee saide one of the greatest States of
this Realme, and a man learned too, and his tender friend,
saide he might doe, without scruple of conscience, as most
of the Nobilitie of the Realme hadde doone, not once
sticking thereat, save onely himselfe, and one other man.
This speach of her hee aunswered with a pleasaunt tale.

At a Bartholomew faire at London, there was an Escheater of
the same city, that had arrested a Clothier that was outlawed,
and had seized his goodes, which he had brought into the faire,
tolling him out of the faire by a traine. The man that was ar∣rested
was a Northerne man, which by his friendes made the
Escheator to be arrested within the faire, vppon an Action I
not neere what, and called a Court of Pipowders. Now 
ad
the Clothier, by friendship of the Officers, found the meanes to
have all the Quest almost made of the Northerne men, such
as had their Boothes standing in the faire, who were no sooner
departed from the barre, and come into the house, but the
Northerne men were agreed, and in effect all the other, to cast
our London Escheater. They thought they needed no were to
proove that hee did wrong, than even the name of his bare of∣fice
alone. But then was there amongest them, as the Divell
woulde, an honest man of another quarter called 
Company.

And the fellow seemed but a seely soule, and sate still, and sayde
nothing; they made noreckoning of him, but saide. We be agreed
now, come, let vs goe and give vp our verdict. Then when the
poore fellow sawe that they made such hasle, and his minde no∣thing
gave him that way that theirs did (if that their 
ndes
gave them that way they saide,) hee prayed them to tarry and
talke vpon the matter, and tell such reason therein, that 
ee
might thinke as they did, and when they should so doe, be would


be glad to say with them; or else hee saide they must pardon
him: For sith 
ee had a soule of his owne to keepe, as they had,
be must say as he thought for his soule, as they must for theirs.
When they heard this they were halfe angry with him, What
good fellow, (quoth one of the Northerne men) whare wannes
thou? Be not we eleaven heere, and thou but one all alone, and
al we agreed, whereto shouldst thou sticke? Whates thy name
gud fellow? Maisters (quoth he) my name is called 
Company.
Company
 (quoth they) now by my troth good felow, play then
the gud companion, come thereon foorth with vs, and passe e∣ven
for gude company. Would God good maisters (quoth the
man againe) that there lay no more weight thereon. But now,
when we shall hence, and come before God, and that hee shall
send you vnto heaven for doing according vnto your conscience,
and me to the divell, for doing against mine, al passing at your
request heere for good company now, By God Maister 
Dic∣kenson

(that was one of the Northerne mens names,) If I
then shall say vnto you al againe; Maisters, I went once with
you for good company, which is the cause that I goe now to hell,
play you the good felowes now againe with mee, as I went then
for good company with you, so some of you go now for good com∣pany
with me: would you goe maister 
Dickenson?
 Nay, nay, by
our Lady, nor never a one of you all. And therefore must you
pardon me for passing as you passe; for the passage of my poore
soule passeth all good company.


In the like sence he vsed often to say,
 That he would ne∣ver
pinne his soule at another mans backe, not even the best
man that he knew that day living; for he knew not whither he
might hap to carry it.


When one came to him, to signifie that hee must pre∣pare
himselfe to die, for hee coulde not live, he called for
his vrinall, wherein when hee had made water, hee cast
it, and viewed it (as Physitions vse) at last hee saide so∣berly,

That hee saw nothing in that water, but that he might
live, if it pleased the King.


When he was in prison, and his bookes and papers ta∣ken
from him, he did shutte his chamber windowes both


day and night, saying; 
When the wares are gone, and the
tooles taken away, we must shut vp shop.


When he went to death, a certaine woman offered him
a cuppe of wine, which he refusing, saide; 
Good woman,
Christ in his passion drunke gall, and no wine.


When he was to mount the scaffold hee saide to one of
the Shiriffes men, 
I pray thee helpe mee vp, as for comming
downe I take no care.


When the hangman (according to his manner) desired
him to pardon him his death, hee answered,
 I doe forgive
thee with al my heart: but one thing I wil tel thee, thou w
t
never have honestie in cutting off my head, my necke is so short.


NOw we have done with sir 
Thomas Moore
 his owne
Apothegmes which have come to my handes, I will
transcribe out of his workes, a few Tales, or call them
what you please.


A poore man found a priest over familiar with his wife,
and because he spake it abroad, and could not prove it, the
priest sued him before the Bishops Officiall for defamati∣on,
where the poore man in paine of cursing was com∣maunded,
that in his parish Church hee should vppon the
Sonday, at high Masse, stand vp, and say, 
Mouth thou
liest:
 Whereuppon for fulfilling of his penaunce, vp was
the poore soule set in a pew, that the people might won∣der
at him, and heare what hee sayde: and there all aloude
(when hee had rehearsed what hee had reported by the
priest) then hee sette his handes on his mouth, and sayde;
Mouth thou liest: And by and by thereupon, he sette his
handes vpon both his eyes, and sayde; 
But eyne
 (quoth
hee) 
by the Masse yee lie not a whit.


When sir 
Thomas Moore
 had told one whom hee tear∣meth
in his Dialogue the Messenger, how he might yeerly
have seene a myracle done at the 
Rhodes,
 if he would have
gone thither. So farre, quoth the Messenge? nay, yet I


had rather have Gods blessing to beleeve that I see not,
then to go so farre for it. I am well apaid (said sir 
Thomas
)
thereof, for if you had rather beleeve, then take the paine
of a long pilgrimage, you will never be so stiffe in any opi∣nion,
that you will put your selfe in ieopardie for pertinacy,
and stubborne standing by your part. Nay Marie said the
Messenger, I warrant you that I will never be so madde,
to hold, till it waxe too hot, for I have such a fond fantasie
of mine owne, that I had rather shiver and shake for colde
in the Summer, then be burned in the mids of Winter.


It happened that a yong Priest verie devoutly in a Pro∣cession,
bare a Candle before the Crosse for lying with a
Wench, and bare it light all the long way, wherein the
people tooke such spirituall pleasure and inward solace,
that they laughed apace. And one merrie Marchant sayd
vnto the Priests that followed him, 
Sic luceat lux vestra
coram hominibus, Thus let your light shine before the people.

But a lewde Priest in later time, being reproved of his loose
life, and told that he and other of the Clergie ought to bee
the Lanthornes of light, 
How can we
 (saide the shamelesse
Priest) 
be Lanthornes of light, when as ye Lay men have all the
hornes.


When a lustie gallant saw a Frier going barefoote in a
great frost and snowe, hee asked him why hee did take
such paine. Hee aunswered, that it was a verie little paine
if a man would remember hell: Yea Frier (quoth the
Gallant) but what and if there be no Hell? Then arte
thou a great foole: Yea Maister (quoth the Frier) but
what if there be hell, then is mastership much more foole.


A Frier as he was preaching in the Countrey, espied a
poore wife of the parish, whispering with her Pew-felow,
and he falling angrie thereat, cried out vnto her aloude,
Holde thy babble I bid thee, thou wife in the red hoode,
which when the huswife heard, she waxed as angrie, and
sodainly she started vp, and cried vnto the Frier againe
that all the Church rang thereon; Mary sir, I beshrew his
heart, that babbleth most of vs both, for I do but whisper


a word with my neighbour here, and thou hast babled
there a good large houre.


King 
Ladislaus
 vsed much this maner among his ser∣vants,
when one of them praised any deed of his, or any
condition in him, if he perceyved that they sayde nothing
but the truth, he would let it passe by vncontrolled: But
when he saw that they did set a glose vpon it for his praise,
of their owne making beside; then would he shortly say
vnto them, I pray thee good fellow, when thou faist grace,
never bring in 
Gloria patri,
 without a 
Sicut erat.
 Any act
that ever I did, if thou report it againe to mine honour,
with a 
Gloria patri,
 never report it but with a 
Suut trat.

That is to wit, euen as it was, and no otherwise, and lift not
me vp with lies, for I loue it not.


Frier 
Donalde
 preached at Paules Crosse, that our La∣die
was a virgin, and yet at her pilgrimages, there was
made many a foule meeting. And loude cried out, Ye men
of London, gang on your selues with your wiues to 
Wils∣don,

in the Divils name, or else keepe them at home with
you with a sorrow.


Sir 
Iohn Moore
 was wont to compare the choosing of a
wife vnto a casuall taking out at all a verie ventures of Eles
out of a bagge, wherein were twentie Snakes for an Ele.


Sir 
Iohn Fineux,
 sometime chiefe Iustice of the Kings
bench, was often heard to say: 
Who so taketh from a Iustice
the order of his discretion, taketh surely from him more than
halfe his office.


Wise was that saying of Doctor
 Medealfe: You yong men
do thinke vs olde men to be fooles, but we olde men do know that
you yong men are fooles.


Katherine
 wife to 
Charles Brandon
 Duke of Suffolke:
when her husband at a feast, willed everie Ladie to take to
sit by hir, him that shee loued best, prouided hee were not
her husband, she tooke 
Stephen Cardiner,
 Bishop of 
Win∣chester,

saying: 
Seeing she might not have him whom she loved
best, she would take him whom she loved worst.



KIng 
Edward
 the sixt when three swordes were deli∣vered
at his coronation vnto him, as king of 
England,
Fraunce,
 and 
Ireland,
 sayd, There was yet another sworde
to be delivered vnto him. Whereat when the Lords mar∣velled,
he sayd: 
I meane
 (sayd he) 
the sacred Bible, which is
the sworde of the spirit, without which we are nothing, neither
can do any thing. [Balaeus in Centurijs.
]


When sit 
Ralfe Fane
 was condemned to die by the pra∣ctise
of the Duke of 
Northumberland,
 he said no more, pro∣testing
his innocencie, but, 
My blood shall be the Dukes bol∣ster,
as long as he liveth:
 Meaning, as I thinke, that his con∣science
affrighted with shedding innocent blood, shoulde
enioy little quiet, but passe restlesse nights. 
Relatio Gallica.


Thirlby
 Bishop of 
Elie,
 when he was Ambassador at

Rome,
 one of hir men negligently laying downe his liuery
cloake, in his lodging lost it: wherewith the Bishop being
angrie rated the fellow roughly, who told him that hee su∣spected
nothing in so holy a place as 
Rome
 was, but did
take them all for true men. What knaue (qvoth the Bi∣shop)
when thou commest into a strange place, thinke all
men there to be theeves, yet take heede thou doe not call
them theeves.


When hee was prisoner in the Tower, he was searched
by the Lievetenaunt, and five hundred French crownes
found in his purse, and in his doublet about him: whereat
when the Lievetenant wondering, asked him, what hee
meant to carry so much money about him: hee answered,

I love to have my friends still neere about mee, and can not tell
how I should be vsed if I lacked them.


In the rebellion in the Weast, during the raigne of king

Edward
 the sixt, sir 
Anthony Kingston
 marshall of the field,
hanged vp a fellow that was servant to a rebellious Miller,
whome he affirmed himselfe to be, vntill hee came vnto
the gallowes, and then his deniall would not be allowed.
Afterward the matter being better knowne, sir 
Anthonie

was tolde that hee had executed the man for the maister.


It is well enough (
quoth sir
 Anthony) hee coulde never have
doone his maister better service, than have hanged for him.


THese following are taken out of the life of Cardinall

Poole
 Archbishop of 
Canterbury,
 written by a lear∣ned
man, and Printed at 
Venice.


When one asked counsell of Cardinall 
Poole,
 what me∣thode
and way was best to be taken, to vnderstand the
obscure places in Saint 
Paules
 Epistles: he answered him
he thought the best and shortest way was, to reade first
the latter parte of those Epistles, which dooth intreate of
Christian manners, and vnderstand it, and expresse it in
life and good manners; and then to go vnto the first part,
where the matters of faith are subtily and exactly handled,
saying; 
That God wil give his spirite of vnderstanding soonest
vnto those, that with al their whole hearts seeke to serve him.


He was wont to say,
 That he and all other Bishops ought
to consider that they were ordained, not onely Iudges over those
of their Dioceses, but father Iudges.


In communication when mention hapned to be made
of a certaine Bishoppe, who was woont to blame the Bi∣shops
that lived at 
Rome,
 and neglected their charge, and
yet he himselfe was resident at 
Rome. He
 (quoth 
Poole) doth
like vnto those that cannot abide the smel of garlicke, for if they
have to do with them that have eaten garlike, they eate some too
themselves, that they may not percerve their stinking breaths.


Speach was heard of a yoong man that was learned in∣deede,
but too bolde, and ready to censure.
 Learning
(
quoth
 Poole) doth worke almost that in yong men, that wine
doth in the fatte; there it worketh, there it boileth vppe, and
swelleth. But as soone as it is purged, and put in the vessel, ha∣ving
gathered his forces together, it is quiet and stil.


When one very skilfull in Astrologie tolde him, that
hee had very exactly calculated his-nativitie, and found
that great matters were portended of him:
 Poole 
aunswe∣red,

Perhaps it may be as you affirme, but you must remember


that I was borne againe by baptisme, and that day of nativitie
wherein I was borne againe, doth eclipse the other before.


When one had saide, that we must be so wholy busied
in the studie of the Scriptures, that no time should be left
for other studies: and another man had added, that the
studies of other learnings were to bee vsed as Wayting-maides,
and Bond-women, 
What do you not know
 (quoth

Poole) that
 Agar 
was cast out of the doores, because shee was
a bond-woman?


When
 Sadolet 
adhorted him vnto the studie of Philo∣sophy,
giving to it the price above all other studies:
 Poole

answered him,
 While al the worlde was overwhelmed with
the darkenesse of Paganisme, it did excel al other Artes: but
since that thicke mist was chased away, by the bright beames of
the preaching of Christ and his Apostles, and their successours;
the study of the sacred Scriptures and divinitie had gotten the
pa
ne and chiefe praise, adding, that Philosophy was now as

Tenedos,
 of whome 
Virgil
 writeth:


—notissima fama


Insula div
s opum Priami dum regna manebant.


Nunc tantùm sinus & statio malefida carinis.


A famous Isle of riches great while Priamus kingdome stoode,


Now nothing but a baggage bay, and harbour nothing good.


He vsed friendly to admonish a certaine Bishop, not
to forsake his sheepe, but rather leaving 
Rome
 to repayre
home and execute his office. This Bishop vpon a time
came vnto him, and tolde him that hee was minded to goe
out of the cittie, for one moneth, and to visite his sheepe,
and therefore hee did desire that hee might departe with
his good leave and liking: 
Poole
 answered, 
I shal take this
comfort by your departure, that you shal bee beaten the lesse.


When Letters were shewed vnto him very artificially
penned, which one had sent vnto a great man, to comfort
him for the death of his friendes, and to tha
 intent had v∣sed
all the places of Rhethoricke, hee read them, and then
saide; 
That hee never in al his life had ever read Letters, that
could bring greater comfort; for they were such, that no man


that shoulde reade them, could be able to keepe himselfe from
laughing.


Having heard a certaine Preacher of great name, who
arrogated much to himselfe, and did passingly please him∣selfe;
hee was asked what hee thought of the man. 
Poole

aunswered; 
Well, but I would that hee would first preach vn∣to
himselfe, and then afterward to other.


When a Nobleman of 
Rome
 tolde him, that hee did
trust that he should come to his pleasaunt gardines, which
hee had sumptuously made, yea thirtie yeeres after, and
wonder at the beauty of them. 
Poole
 answered, 
I hope I
have not deserved so ill of you, that you should wish me so long a
banishment from my heavenly country.


While he was in the Low countries, and one day would
have gone vnto 
Charles
 the Emperour, but hee could not
be admitted to his speach: but two dayes after the Bishop
of 
Arras
 was sent vnto him by the Emperour, to excuse
his long stay, and desire him to come vnto him: 
Poole

sayde, that hee had strange happe, 
That whereas be spake
daily vnto God for the Emperour, yet he was not admitted vn∣to
the Emperour, to talke with him about a matter belonging
to God.


There was one that was very curious in keeping of his
beard, and it was reported that hee bestowed every mo∣neth
two duckats vpon the trimming of it. 
If it be so
 (said

Poole) his beard wil shortly be more woorth than his head.


After the death of
 Paulus Tertius 
when many Cardinals
came vnto him, and tolde him, that if hee liked of it, they
would make him Pope:
 He desired them to looke well to it,
that they were swayed by no passion of the minde, or did ought
for favour, and good-will, but referre all their cogitations wh
∣lie
vnto the honour of God, and the profite of his Church; the
which only they all ought especially to have alwayes before their
eyes.


When one of the Cardinalls of the adverse faction did
one day charge him with ambition, and saide that hee did
vntimely and over-hastily seeke the Popedome: He an∣swered


gravely
 That he thought not the burthen of that great
office to be so light, but that he was of the minde, that it was ra∣ther
to be feared, than desired. A
 for them which vnderstood
not, and thought more basely of so great a place, hee lamented
their case, and was sory for them.


When the Cardinall
 Farnesi, 
and diverse other of his
fri
nds came vnto him, at midnight, to make him Pope,
by adoration, he repelled them saying;
 He would not have
so weighty a matter tumultuously and rashly done, but v
aily
and orderly, that the night was no convenient time therefore,
that God loved the light more than darkenesse, wherefore they
should deferre it vntill the next day, and that then of it plea
ed
God, it might very well be done. 
But this his pious modesty
lost him the Papacie.


He vsed often to say,
 Those which would betake them vn∣to
the study of the holy Scriptures, (which was as though they
would goe into the inner and secret parte of the Temple) must
passe thorow a lowe and a narrow doore: For that no man can
attaine to the vnderstanding of the Scriptures, that is prowde
and puffed vp with the sharpenesse of his wit, or excellencie of
humane learning; but be that bringeth lowlinesse of minde, and

 tempt of himselfe, and yeeldes his vnderstanding (
as the A∣postle
saith
) captive vnto faith.


Of this also did hee often admonish those that woulde
study the sacred Scriptures,
 That they should specially beware
that they never went to the reading of them with this intent and
minde, that they might dispute of them to shew their learning,
and by that knowledge to get them honors and riches: for both
purposes, were every contrary to this kind of studie. Wherevnto
ought to be adhibited, first fervent prayers▪ then a lowely mind,
and finally an heart voyde of all ambition and greedy desire.

Thus farre of this good Cardinall.


Wil
iam 
Marq
es of
 Winchester, 
being asked how hee
continued of the counsel on the troblesome times of divers
Princes, aunswered.
 By being a Willow, and not an Oake.

Hee woulde also often say, that he found great ease in this:



That I never sought to rule the r
ste, and to be the director of
others, but alwayes suffred my selfe to be swayed with the most
and mightiest. 
As another Courtier of former times saide
he had borne off many court-stormes indangerous times.

By suffering iniuries and giving thankes for them.


A lusty gallant that had wasted much of his patrimony,
seeing master 
Dutton
 a gentleman in a gowne, not of the
newest out, tolde him that hee had thought it had beene
his great grandfathers gowne, 
It is so
 (saide maister 
Dut∣ton)
and I have also my great grandfathers lands, and so have
not you.


A reverend man my first teacher would often say in the
middest of his mirth, 
Sorrowe is good for nothing save sinne
onely.


NOw we draw to an end, have a few savings of merie
M. 
elwood
 the great Epigrammatist. When Qu:

Mary
 tolde this 
Heiwood,
 that the Priests must forgoe
their wives. Hee merrily aunswered, 
Your Grace must al∣low
them Lemmans then, for the Cleargie can not live without
sawce.


He being asked of the saide Queene 
Mary,
 what winde
blew him to the Court, answered her, 
Two specially, the one
to see your Maiestie,
 We thanke you for that, said Queene

Mary;
 But I pray you, what is the other? 
That your Grace

(saide he) 
might see me.


When one told him, that 
Pace
 being a maister of Arte
had disgraced himselfe with wearing a fooles come, he an∣swered,

It is lesse hurtfull to the common-weale, when wise∣men
goe in fooles coates, than when fooles goe in w
e m
ns
gownes.


When hee sawe one riding that bare a wanton behinde
him, hee saide;
 In good faith sir, I would say that your horse
were overloaden, if I did not perceive this the 

you carry were very light.



When a man of worship, whose beere was better hop∣ped
than maulted, asked him at his Table, how hee liked
of his beere, and whether it were not well hopped: 
Yes
by the faith of my body
 (saide hee) 
it is very well hopped:
but if it ha
 hoppea a li
tle further, it had hopped into the wa∣ter.


When one saide, that the number of Lawyers woulde
marre the occupation; hee aunswered, 
No, for alwayes
the more spaniels in the field, the more game.


This vsuall speech of sir
 Th: Moore, 
both of himselfe
& other Book breeders, which is also extant in an Epistle
of his, I have reserved to close vp this part.
 Booke-makers
are ful
se folke who p
ine and 
ne themselves away by wri∣ting,
to subiect themselves to the censure of such which in Or∣dinaries
and in Ale-benches will 
 pull them by their
wordes, phrases, and lines, as it were by the beards; when some
of them are so pill
 themselves, as that they have not one haire
of honestie; 
or to vse his owne wordes,
 Ne pilum boni ho∣minis.

But these he resembleth to those vnmanerly guests,

which when they have bin well and kindely entertained flinch
away never giving thankes, but depraving and disprasing their
curteous entertainement.

POEMS.


O
F the dignity of Poetry much hath
beene said by the worthy Sir 
Philipp
Sidney,
 and by the Gentleman which
proued that Poets were the first 
Poli∣ticians,

the first 
Philosophers,
 the first

Historiographers.
 I will onely adde
out of 
Philo,
 that they were Gods
owne creatures, who in his Booke 
de Plantatione Noe,
 re∣porteth,
that when he had made the whole worlds masse;
he created Poets to celebrate and set out the Creator him∣selfe,
and all the creatures: you Poëts read the place and
you will like it. Howsoeuer it pleaseth the 
Italian
 to cen∣sure
vs, yet neither doth the Sunne so farre retire his charri∣ot
from our Climate, neither are there lesse fauourable a∣spects
betweene 
Mercurie, Iupiter,
 and the Moone, in our
inclination of heauen, if Poëts are 
Fato,
 as it pleased 
Socra∣tes,

neither are our Poets destitute of Arte prescribed by rea∣son,
and grounded vpon experience, but they are as preg∣nant
both in witty conceits and deuises, and also in imitati∣on,
as any of them. Yea and according to the argument ex∣cell
in granditie and grauity, in smoothnesse and proprie∣tie,
in quicknesse and briefnesse. So that for skill, varietie,
efficacie, and sweetnesse, the foure materiall points requi∣red
in a Poët, they can both teach and delight perfectly.


This would easily appeare if any lines were extant of
that worthy 
British
 Lady 
Claudia Rufina,
 so commended
by 
Martial,
 or of 
Gildas
 which 
Lilius Giraldus
 sawe in the
libraries of 
Italie,
 or of old 
Chedmon
 who by diuine inspi∣ration
about the yeare 680. became so diuine a Poët in our
English tongue, that with his sweete verses full of com∣punction,
he withdrew many from vice to vertue, and a re∣ligious
feare of God: or of our 
Claudius Clemens
 one of
the first founders of the Vniuersity of 
Paris:
 and doth most
clearely appeare to all that can iudge by many learned
Poems published in this our learned age. But whereas
these later are in euery mans hand, and the former are


irrecouerable, I will onely giue you a taste of some of mi∣dle
age, which was so ouercast with darke clouds, or rather
thicke fogges of ignorance, that euery little sparke of libe∣rall
learning seemed wonderfull: so that if sometime you
happen of an vncouth word, let the time entreate pardon
for it, when as all words haue their times, and as he saith.


licuit semperque licebit,


Signatum praesente nota procudere nomen.


We will begin with 
Ioseph
 of 
Excester,
 who followed
our King 
Richard
 the first in his warres in the holy land,
celebrated his acts in a booke called 
Antiocheidos,
 and tur∣ned

Dares Phrigius
 so happily into verse, that it hath been
Printed not long since in 
Germany,
 vnder the name of 
Cor∣nelius
Nepos.


The passing of the pleasant riuer 
Simois
 by 
Troy,
 & the
encounter betweene the waues of the Sea, and it, at the di∣semboging,
or inlett therof, he liuely setteth forth thus:

Proxima rura rigans alio peregrinus ab orbe


Visurus Troiam Simois, longoque meatu


Emeruisse velit, vt per tot regna, tot vrbes


Exeat aequoreas tandem Trotanus in vndas.


Dumque indefesso miratur Pergama visu


Lapsurum suspendit iter, fluuiumque moratur,


Tardior & totam complects destinat vrbem:


Suspensis infensus aquis violentior instat


Nereus, atque amnem cogens procùl ire minorem;


Proximus accedit vrbi, contendere credas


Quis propior, sic alternis concurritur vndis,


Sic crebras iterant voces, sic iurgia miscent.


You may at one view behold mount 
Ida
 with his trees, &
the country adiacent to 
Troy
 in these few lines, as in a most
pleasant prospect presēted vnto you thus, by the said 
Ioseph.


Haud procul incumbens intercurrentibus aruis


Idaeus consurgit apex, vetus incola montis


Silua viret, vernat abies procera, cupressus


Flebilis, interpres laurus, vaga pinus, oliua

Staet comitis patiens vlmus, nunquamque senescens


Cantatrix buxus: paulò procliuiùs aruum


Ebria vitis habet non dedignata latere


Cancricolam poscit Phoebum, vicinus aristas


Praegnantes faecundat ager▪ non plura Falernus

Paris,
 in the action
of beauty, a matter of greatest importance in that sex, after
this manner of reply.


Magna parens superûm, nec enim nego; magna Tonantis


Nupta, nec inuideo; meritum, Paris inclyte, nostrum


Si quod erat carpsit testor freta, testor Olympum,


Testor humum, non armatas in praelia linguae


Credideram venisse deas; hâc parte loquacem


Erubeo sexum, minùs hîc quàm faemina possum;

Plus laudis victore feret, nostrisque trophaeis

In the commendation of 
Britaine,
 for breeding Martiall
men, and praise of the famous King 
Arthur,
 he song in his

Antiocheidos
 these which onely remaine out of that worke,

Inclita fulsit


Posteritas ducibus tantis, tot diues alumnis,


Tot faecunda viris, premerent qui viribus o

Et famà veteres. Hinc Constantinus adeptus


Imperium, Romam tenuit, Byzantion auxit.


Hinc Senenum ductor captiuà Brennius vrbe,


Romuleas domuit flammis victricibus arces.


Hinc & Scaeua satus pars non obscura tumultus


Ciuilis, Magnum solus qui mole soluta


Obsedit, meliorque stetit pro Caesare murus,



Hinc celebri fato faelici floruit ortu


Flos regum Arthurus, cuius tamen acta stupori


Non micuere minùs, totus quòd in aure voluptas


Et populo plaudente fauus. Quacunque priorum


Inspice, Pellaeum commendat fama Tyrannum,


Pagina Caesareos loquitur Romana triumphos,


Alciden domitis attollit gloria monstris.


Sed nec pinetum coryli, nec sydera solem


Aequant, Annales Graios, Latiosque reuolue,


Prisca parem nescit, aequalem postera nullum


Exhibitura dies. Reges supereminet omnes


Solus praeteritis melior, maiorque futuris.


If a painter would portraite deuills let him paint them in
his coulors, as 
Foelix
 the old Monke, of 
Crowland
 depayn∣ted
the bugges of 
Crowland
 in his verses, and they will
seeme right hell-hounds.


Sunt aliqui quibus est crinis rigidus, caput amplum,


Frons cornuta, gena distorta, pupilla coruscans,


Os patulum, labra turgentia, dens praeacutus,


Et quibus est crinis quasi seta, caput quasi truncus,


Frons quasi cera, gena quasi pix, oculus quasi carbo,


Os quasi sporta, labra quasi plumbum, dens quasi buxus.


Sunt alij quibus est vultus gibbosus & acer,


Nasus curuatus & foedus, auris acuta,


Et grandis, ceruix dependens & macilenta:


Caesaries & barba rigens, frons & gena pallens,


Nasus & auris olens, vertex & sinciput horrens.


Et sunt perplures qui crine videntur adusto,


Fronte truci, naso praegrandi, lumine toruo.


Faucibus horrendis, labris pendentibus, ore


Igniuomo, vultu squamoso, vertice grosso,


Dente fero, mento peracuto, gutture rauco,


Pelle nigra, scapulis contractis, ventre rapaci,


Costis mobilibus, lumbis ardentibus, anis


Caudatis, genibus nodatis, cruribus vncis,


Plantis auersis, talisque tumentibus, & sunt


Nonnulli, quibus est non horrida forma, sed ipse



Horror, cum non sint scelerati, sed scelus ipsum.


He did seeme also a good poet in his age, which described
a great battaile betweene the Danes and the English; thus.


Eminùs in primis hiberni grandinis instar


Tela volant, syluas hastarum fragmina frangunt;


Mox ruitur propiùs, praescinditur ensis ab ense,


Conculcatur equus ab equo, ruit hostis in hostem.


Hic effossa trahit hostili viscera ferro,


Hic tacet exanimis fusâ cum sanguine vitâ.


Hic pedis, ille manus, hic pectoris, ille lacerti


Vulnere damnatus reditum proponit inanem.


If he which scraped together the fragments of ancient
poets, had hapned on the verses following, written to a Bi∣shop
of 
Norwich,
 happely he would haue inserted them.


Magnus Alexander bellorum saepe procellas


Immixtus fregit studijs, Socratesque studend


Continuum solitus interrupisse laborem,


Threicias tremulo numerauit pollice chordas.


Cedit Atlas oneri, ciuili scriptor ab ense


Iulius abstinuit, inuictus saepe quieuit


Alcides, rigidum mollis lyra flexit Achillem,


Tu quoque lugenti patriae grauiterque diuque


Expectate parens, sibi quem viduata maritum


Iam Pastoralis Norwici regia poscit. &c.


Iohn Hanuill
 a Monke of S. 
Albanes
 made this good &
godly inuocation before his poeme, comparable with ma∣ny
of the latter broode.


Tu Cyrrhae latices nostrae Deus implue menti,


Eloquij rorem siccis infunde labellis,


Distillaque fauos, quos nec dum pallidus auro


Scit Tagus, aut sitiens admotis Tantalus vndis.


Dirige qua timidè susc
pit dextera, dextram


Audacem pauidamque iuua, tu mentis habenas


Feruoremque rege, quicquid dictauerit ori


Spiritus aridior, oleum suffunde fauoris.


Tu patris es verbum, tu mens, tu dextra, Verbum


Expediat verbum, mens mentem, dextera dextram.


Lasie and superficiall scholers which thrust the day for∣ward


ward with their shoulders in the vniuersity, and returne as
wise as they came thether he describeth in this sort:

Hi sunt qui statuae veniunt-statuaeque recedunt,


Et Bacchi sapiunt non Phaebi pocula, Nysae


Agmina non Cirrhae, Phaebo Bacchoque ministrant,


Hoc pleni illo vacui.


The old ale knights of England were well depainted out
of him, in the ale house coulours of that time, in this maner,

Iamque vagante scypho, discincto gutture 
was-heil


Ingeminant 
was-fieil;
 labor est plus perdere vini


Quam sitis, exhaurire merum vehementius ardent,


Quàm exhaurire sitim.


The same 
Iohn Hanuill
 when he would signifie whatso∣euer
enuy had wrought against Troy, the Roman vertue
had repayred, sung briefely.


Si quid de cùlmine Troiae


Diminuit liuor, virtus reparauit, vt orbi


Hic vrbem rapuit, haec orbem reddidit vrbi.


Passionate are these verses vpon the death of K. 
Richard

the first, penned by one 
Gaulfrid.


Neustria sub clypeô Regis defensa Richardi


Indefensa modò gestu testare dolorem,


Exundent oculi lachrimas exterminet ora


Pallor, connodet digitos tortura, cruentet


Interiora dolor, & verberet aera clamor:


Tota peris ex morte suâ, mors non fuit eius


Sed tua, non vna sed publica mortis imago.


O Veneris lachrimosa dies, ô sidus amarum.


Illa dies tua nox fuit, & Venus illa venenum.


Illa dedit vulnus, sed pessimus ille dierum


Primus ab vndecimo, qui vitam victricus ipsam


Clausit, vterque dies homicida, tyrannide mira,


Traiecit clausus inclusum, tectus apertum,


Prouidus incautum, miles munitus inermem,


Et proprium Regem.


And after a fewe verses: he speaking to Death, addeth in
commendation of that prince.




—, Nihil addere nouerat vltrà


Ipse fuit quicquid potuit natura, sed istud


Causa fuit quare rapuisti, res pretiosas


Eligis, & viles quasi dedignata relinquis.


These former verses were mentioned by 
Chaucer

our English 
Homer
 in the description of the sodaine
stirre and 
Panicall
 feare when 
Chanteclere
 the cocke
was caried away by Reynold the Foxe with a relation
to the said 
Galfride.


The silly widow and her daughters two


Herd the hennes crie and make ado.


And out at the dore stert they anon


And saw the fox toward the woodygon,


And bare vpon his back the cock away


And cried out harow and well away.


Aha the fox, and after him they ran,


And eke with staues many other man.


Ran Coll our dogge, Talbot and eke Garland,


And Malkin with her distaffe in her hand,


Ran Cow and Calfe and eke the very hogges,


For they so sore affraid were of the dogges.


And showting of men and of women eake.


They ran so her hert thought to breaks


They yellen as fends do in hell,


The Duckes cried as men would them quell,


The Geese for feare flew ouer the trees,


Out of the heues came swarmes of Bees.


So hideous was the noyse, ah benedicite


Certes Iack Strawe, ne his meiney


Ne made neuer shoutes halfe so shrill


When that they would any Fleming kill,


As that day was made vpon the Fox.


Of brasse they blew the trumpes and of box,


Of horne, and box, i which they blew and pouped,


And therewith they shriked and shouted,


It seemed as though heauen should fall.


O Gaulfride dere maister soueraigne,



That whan the worthy King 
Richard
 was slaine


With shot, complainedst his death so sore,


Why ne had I now thie science, and thy lore?


The Friday for to chide as did ye,


For on a Friday shortly slaine was he.


Then would I shew you how that I could plaine,


For Chauntecleercs dred and for his paine.


Certes such crie, ne lamentation,


Was neuer of Ladyes made when that Ilion


Was won, an 
Pirrhus
 with his bright sword,


Whan he hent King 
Priam
 by the beard,


And slough him (as saith 
Aeneidos
)


As made all the hennes in the cloos,


Whan they lost of Chantecleere the sight:


But souerainly dame Pert
lott shright,


Well louder than did Hasdruballs wife,


Whan that her husband hath lost his life,


And that the Romans had brent 
Cartage,


She was so full of torment and of rage,


That wilfully into the fire she stert,


And brent her selfe with a stedfast hert.


O wofull Hennes right so cried ye,


As when that 
Nero
 brent the city


Of 
Rome,
 cried the Senators wives,


For that her husbonds should lose her lives.


These may suffice for some Poeticall descriptions of
our auncient Poets, if I would come to our time, what a
world could I present to you out of Sir 
Philipp Sidney, Ed.
Spencer, Samuel Daniel, Hugh Holland, Ben: Iohnson, Th.
Campion, Mich. Drayton, George Chapman, Iohn Marston,
William Shakespeare,
 & other most pregnant witts of these
our times, whom succeeding ages may iustly admire.








Epigrammes.


I
N short and sweete Poems, framed to
praise or dispraise, or some other sharpe
conceit which are called 
Epigrammes,

as our countrie men now surpasse other
nations, so in former times they were
not inferior, if you consider ages, as the
indifferent Reader may iudge by these.


In the praise of our natiue Countrie England, 
Alfred
 of

Beuerley
 made this.


Anglia plena iocis, gens libera et apta iocari,


Libera gens cui libera mens & libera lingua,


Sed lingu. i melior, liberiorque manus.


And in another olde Booke I finde this.


Anglia dulce solum, quod non aliena, recensque,


Sed tua dulcedo pristina dulce facit,


Quae nihil à Galli
, sed Gallia suscipit à te


Quicquid amoris habet quicquid honoris, habet.


In the darke misle of all good learning, about 800.
yeares since, in commendation of the godly King Saint

Os
uald,
 was made this.


Quis fuit Alcides? quis Casar Iulius? aut quis


Magnus Alexander? Alcides se superasse


Fertur, Alexander mundum: sed Iulius hostem:


Se simul Osuualdus, & mundum vicit, & hostem.


To the honour of 
Elfleda
 noble Lady, which repaired

Darby, Chester, Warwicke, &c.
 I haue found this.


O Elfleda potens, ô terror virgo virorum,


Victrix naturae, nomine digna viri;


Te quo splendidior fieres, natura puellam,


Te probitas fecit nomen habere viri.


Te mutare decet, sed solum nomina sexus


Tu Regina potens, Rexque trophaea parans.


Iam nec Caesarei tantum meraeri triumphi,


Caesare splendidior virgo, virago viges.



This also may here haue place, which 
William Conque∣rours

Poet made to him whē he had obtained this Realme.


Caesariem Caesar tibi si natura negauit,


Hanc Wilielme tibi stella comata dedit.


It may seeme he alluded to the baldnesse of 
Iulius Caesar,

who for that cause vsed a Lawrell Garland, to the Comete
appearing before his conquest of this kingdome, porten∣ding
the same as it was thought, and to the manner of the

French
 in that time: among whom long bushie haire was
the signale marke of Maiestie, as 
Agathias
 noteth, when as
all subiects were rounded, and the Kings only long haired.
Which custome continued among the 
French
 Kings, vntill

Peter Lombard
 Bishop of 
Paris
 disswaded them from it,
and among ours, as appeareth by their seales vntill King

Henry
 the 5.


The happy successe of 
English
 and 
Normans,
 with the
cowardly flight of the 
French,
 at 
Nugent
 1109 in the time
of King 
Henry
 the first, was thus expressed.


Henricus regum rex & decus, abstulit altos


Francigenis animos, Ludouicum namque Nugenti


Rex regem campo magnum maior superauit:


Praeposuere fugam bellis, calcaria telis


Galli praecipites: fama spolijsque potitos


Laureâ Normanos, & laus aterna coronat,


Sic decus iste ducum sic corda tumentia pressit,


Oraque Francorum superba mutire coegit.


Maud
 daughter to 
Malcolm
 King of 
Scots,
 a woman of
rare pietie, buried at Westminster, to which Church she
would come dayly barefoote, while the Court laye there,
had an excellent 
Epigramme
 made to her commendation,
whereof these foure verses onely remaine.


Prospera non laetam fecere, nec aspera tristem,


Aspera risus erant, prospera terror erant.


Non decor effecit fragilem, non sceptra superbam,


Sola potens humilis, sola pudica decens.


No bad Poet was he which wrote to the honor of 
Adeliza,

second wife to King 
Henry
 the first, who was daughter to


the Duke of 
Brabant,
 & sister to Lord 
Ioscelin,
 from whom
the 
Percies
 Earles of 
Northumberland
 descended.


Anglorum Regina tuos Adeliza decores


Ipsa referre parans Musa, stupore riget.


Quid Diadema tibi pulcherrima? quid tibi gemma?


Pallet gemma tibi, nec Diadema nitet.


Deme tibi cultus, cultum natura ministrat,


Non exornari forma beata potest.


Ornamenta caue, nec quicquam luminis inde


Accipis, illa micant lumine clara tuo;


Non puduit modicas de magnis dicere laudes,


Nec pudeat dominam te precor esse meam.


But among all our olde Epigrammatists all commendati∣on
is carried away by olde 
Godffery Prior
 of Winchester,
who liued Anno 1100. which Citie hath brought forth so
many excelling in Poeticall facultie, not onely in former
ages, but also in latter, out of the worthy Colledge there,
that the very 
Genius loci
 doth seeme Poeticall. Out of his
Epigrammes first imparted to me by the right learned
Maister 
Th. Allen
 of 
Oxford,
 I will here impart a few vn∣to
you.


To one that would know how long he should learne,
he wrighteth thus.


Discendi Damiane modum te quaerere dicunt,


Discas dum nescis, sit modus iste tibi.


That the contempt of fooles is not to be respected.


Contemptum stulti contemnere Dindime laus est,


Contemni a stulto dedecus esse nego.


Against pride in prosperitie.


Extolli noli quùm te fortuna beauit


Pompone, haec eadem quae leuat, ipsa premit.


Against such as teach well, and liue not accordingly.


Multa Solon, sed plura Cato me verba docetis,


At nemo vestrum quanta docetis, agit.


To one which had eaten stinking meate.


Druse comedisti quem misit Siluius hircum,


Vel tibi non nasus, vel tibi nasus olet.



He teacheth vs to relye vpon firme and sure supports,
lest we fall to the ground with them in this.


Non est securus super titubantia fultus


Iungere labenti, labitur ille, ruis.


That we must looke for like measure, if we doe not as we
would be done vnto, he admonisheth all vnder the name
of 
Albius.


Iurgia, clamores tibi gloria gloria lites,


Et facis & dicis omnibus, vnde noces.


Expectes ead
m quae nobis seceris Albi,


Nam quem tu laedis, te ferit ille libens.


Youth which in their haughty heat, reiect the aduise of
ould men, he aduiseth thus.


Pannorum veterum facile contemnitur vsus


Non sic consilium, posthumiane, senum.


The vanity of them which vaunt of their auncient no∣bility,
and haue no nobility in themselues, he thus taxeth.


Stemmata continuas, recitas ex ordine patres,


Queis nisi tu similis, Rufule quid recitas?


That there was no contending with him who with mis∣siue
bribes can preuaile against Iustice.


Missilibus Daciane tuis Astraea recessit


Vincis m
ssilibus Ius Dac
nc tuis.


The common prouerbe, 
Loue me loue mine,
 he thus adui∣sed
vs to obserue,


Me tanquam socium te dicis amare Trebati,


Et quos totus amo dente furente teris


Sed nisi sis socius socijs, & amic
s


Non potero nostrum dicere te socium.


Against hooked gifts which draw others.


Multa mihi donas, vereor ne multa requiras,


Nolo mihi doncs Aulice, si repetas.


Against one that sought a benefice and would teach be∣fore
he could teach.


Quâ doceat sedem quaerit Pl
timus & aedem,


Quarit quâ doceat, non ea quae doceat,



Against a couetous wretch.


Nasidiane diu vixisti semper anarus,


Oro tibi 
uas Nasidiane dus.


Against one that would exact of others, and do nothing
himselfe.


Ex
gis a nobis quem 
 soluis amorem,


Quam nulli praestes exigis. Aule sidem.


Exig
 à nobis quem non m
rearis honorem,


Mirum est quod non das, id tibi velle 
.


Against an Abbot that would defend his monks from
others, but worrye them himselfe.


Tollit onem de fauce lupi persaepe molossus,


Ereptamque lupo ventre recondit ouem.


Tu quoque Sceuae tuos praedone tueris ab omni,


Vnus praedo tamen perdis vbique tuos.


One amidst the warres betweene King 
Stephen
 and 
Hen∣rie

the second, commended the same 
Henry
 in these verses.


Praelia quanta mouet Stephanus, moucat volo namque


Gloria nulla foret si pralia null: moueret.


Tu contra Stephanum cui copia multa virorum;


Duxisti pautos, our paucos? gloria maior,


Est▪ multos paucis, quàm paucos vincere multis.


At the same troublesome time and as it were desolation
of 
England
 were written to the same 
Henry
 as it were in a

Prosopopcia
 of 
England.


Dux Henrice nepos Henrici maxime magni;


Anglia tota ruo, nec iam ruo, tota ruina. &c.


Vpon two other fearfull flights of the 
French,
 one at

Vernoil,
 the other at 
Vandosme
 in the time of King 
Henry

the second, one made this.


Gallia fugisti bis, & hoc sub rege Philippo,


Nec sunt sub modio facta pudenda duo.


Vernolium sumit testem fuga prima, secunda


Vindocîum, noctem prima▪ secunda diem.


Nocte fugam primam celerasti, mane secundam,


Prima pauore fuit, vique secunda fuit.



When one had flattered 
William Longchampe
 Bishop of

Elye
 the only powerable man of England in his time with
this blandation.


Tam benè, tam facile, tu magna negotia tractas,


Vt dubium reddas sis homo, siue deus.


Giraldus Cambrensis
 a man well borne and better lettered,
of that house from whence the 
Giraldines
 of Ireland are
descended, and secretary to King 
Iohn,
 played vpon these
verses, and that Bishop after he was apprehended in wo∣mans
attire flying out of the realme.


Tam male, tam temerè, tam turpiter omnia tractas,


Vt dubium reddas bellua sis, vel homo.


Sic cum sis minimus tentas maioribus vti,


Ve dubium reddas simia sis, vel homo.


He that made the verse following (some ascribe it to
that 
Giraldus
) could adore both the sonne rising, and
the sonne setting, when he could so cleanly honour
King 
Henry
 the second then departed, and King 
Richard

succeeding.


Miracano sol occubuit, nox nulla sequuta.


Great was the commendation of 
Maecenas,
 who when he
could do all with 
Augustus,
 yet neuer harmed any, where∣vpon
in an Elegie vpon his death, 
Pedo Albinouanus
 wri∣teth.


Omnia cum posses, tanto tam carus amico,


Te sensit nemo posse nocere tamen.


Which commendation king 
Henry
 the eight gaue to that
worthy Duke of 
Suffolke Charles Brandon,
 who neuer vsed
the Kings fauour to the hurt of any. And the same 
Giraldus

testified the like of King 
Henry
 the second, in this verse ve∣ry
effectually.


Glorior hoc vno, quòd nunquam vidimus vnum,


Nec potuisse magis, nec nocuisse minùs.


These also following are referred vnto him.


Viue deo, tibi mors requies, tibi vita labori,


Viue Deo, mors est viuere, vita mori.



These following were likewise written by him against
lewde loue.


Nec laus, nec probitas, nec honor superare puellam,


Sed Veneris vitium vincere laudis opus.


Vis melius sapiens, melius vis strenuus esse,


Si Venerem superes, istud & istud eris:


Noli castra sequi Veneris, sed castra Mineruae,


Haec docet, illa furit, haec iu
at, illa nocet.


Cum sit amor vetitus, vetiti malus actus amoris,


Si malus ergo nocet, si nocet, ergo fuge,


Cuius caepta timor, medium scelus, exitus ignis,


Tu fuge, tu reproba, tu metuendo caue.


Why the Sun appeareth ruddy and as it were blusheth at
his first rising. 
Alexander Necham
 somtime prior of 
Ciren∣cester

rendreth the cause thus.


Sol vultu roseo rubicundo fulget in ortu,


Incestae noctis facta pudore notans.


Nempè rubore suo tot damnat damna pudoris,


Cernere tot Phaebum gesta pudenda pudet▪


Tot blandos nexus, tot suauia pressa labellis,


Tot miserae Veneris monstra nouella videt.


Frigida quòd nimium caleat lasciua senectus,


Ignis quòd gelido ferueat amne stupet.


Of the fiery coulour of the planet 
Mars,
 and the spotts in
the 
Moone
 he giueth this reason.


Mars Venerem secum deprensam fraude mariti


Erubuit, superest flammeus ille rubor.


Sed cur lunaris facies fuscata videtur?


Quae vultu damnat, furta videre solet.


Adde quòd Ecclesiam Phaebe, maculae nota culpam


Signat, habet maculas vtr{que} Luna suas.


If you will read carping Epigrammaticall verses of a 
Dur∣ham

Poet against the prior 
Ralfe,
 here you may haue
them.


De sene, de caluo, de delirante Radulpho


Omnia monstra cano, nil nisi vera tamen:



Imputat errores alijs semper, sibi nunquam,


Est alijs Argus, Tyresiasque sibi.


Non vult esse bonus, sed vult bonus esse videri▪


Est ouis exterius, interiusque lupus.


Sus vita, canis officio, vulpecula fraude,


Mente lepus, passer renibus, ore lupus.


Talis qui daemon nunquam poterit nisi morte


Esse bonus, postquam desinat esse malus.


The same Author plaid also pretily vpon 
William
 and

Alan
 Arch-deacons of 
Northumberland
 and 
Durham.


Archileuitas in sorte Northumbria largos,


Dunnelmum cupidos semper habere solet.


Nunc è conuerso sedem dotauit vtramque


Willelmi probitas, crimen Alane tuum.


Vos nunc degeneres patribus succeditis ambo,


Hic bonus, antè malus, hîc malus, antè bonus.


Answerable to these, were these verses of the said 
Dur∣ham

Poet, vpon the fate of a Potte and a Pipkin, when the
potte was all broken, and the Pitcher lost but the handle,
by the fall of a window.


Lapsa fenestra ruit, luit vrna sciphusque propinquus,


Desinit haec esse prorsus, hic esse bene.


Alias.


Lapsa fenestra ruit, sciphus vrna luunt, nihil illa


Quo teneat, nihil hic quo teneatur, habet.


When King 
Richard
 the first was deteined prisoner
with the Emperour, one did write this supplicant verse to
the Emperour in a sharpe close.


Magnus es, & genibus flexis tibi supplicat orbis,


Cum possis, noli saeuire, memento Neronis.


A huswife which had encreased her family in her hus∣bands
absence with a new bratte, assured her husband at
his returne, that she conceiued it of a Snow-ball cast at her.
But he conueying it away, selling it to a begger assured her
with the like lye; that as it was conceiued by Snowe, so it
was melted away by the Sunne, which a Poet in the time
of K. 
Iohn
 expressed thus very briefly, & for that age pretily.




Rebus in augendis longè remorante marito,


Vxor maecha parit puerum; post multa reuerso,


Dè niue conceptum fingit, fraus mutua, cautè


Sustulit, asportat, vendit, matri{que} reportans


Ridiculum simile, liquefactum sole refingit.


But two others comprised the same matter more succinct∣ly
in this maner.


De niue conceptum quem mater adultera fingit,


S
o
sus eum vendens, liquefactum sole refi
xit.


Vir quia quem reperit genitum niue famina fingit


Vendit, & a simili liquefactum sole resinxit.


That scholler also could play at euen and odd, that could
keepe the figure 
Compar
 so precisely in these two verses
vpon the spring.


Turba colorum, vis violarum, pompa rosarum,


Induit hortos, purpurat agros, pascit ocellos.


A suter wearied with delais in the Emperours court, did at
the length frame this distiche, and coled it on a wall.


Si nequeo placidas affari Caesaris aures,


Saltem aliquis veniat, qui mihi dicat, Abi.


So a poore English man fed with vaine hope by many, in
the time of King 
Henry
 the third did write this distiche.


Spem mihi dent alij magnam, rem tu citò paruam,


Res me parua iuuet, spes mihi magna nocet.


Against a carping companion was this made about that
time by 
Iohn Hauill.


Zoile tu laudem cunens, tu serra bonorum,


Magna doles, maiora notas, in maxima saeuis.


Such as can speake feelingly of church liuings, will not dis∣semble
that these were the fowre entraunces into the
church, which a countriman of ours long since in this man∣ner
Epigrammatically opened.


Ecclesias portis his quatuor itur in omnes,


Principis, & Simonis, sanguinis at{que}, Dei.


Prima patet magnis, nummatis altera, charis


Tertia, sed raris ianua quarta patet.



Good also is that vnder 
S. Peter
 in the Cathedral church of

Norwich,
 (were it not for the fault which is in the former,)
but therein you haue 
S. Peters
 ship Sea, Nets, and Fishe.


Ecclesiam pro Naue rego, mihi climata mundi


Sunt mare, scriptura retia, piscis homo.


When 
Eustathius
 was elected Bishop of London, one con∣gratulated
his aduancement thus.


Omnes hic digni, tu dignior omnibus, omnes


Hic plenè sapiunt, plenius ipse sapis.


Of a bragging braule betweene two well met, was framed
this by 
Henry
 of 
Winchester,
 but the beginning is lost.


Hic ait, ille negat, hic asserit, ille refellit,


Hic proauos multum praedicat, ille premit.


Fisus vter{que} sibi se venditat, iste decorem


Iactitat, ille decus, hic opus, alter opes.


Hic bonus, ille beatus, hic multis disserit, ille


Multiplicata refert: hic leuis, ille loquax.


When 
Adrian
 our countriman had conuerted some people
of 
Norway,
 and was made Pope, this was composed to his
honour.


Conferet hic Romae, plus laudis quam sibi Roma,


Plus dabit hic orbi, quàm dabit orbis ei.


But this would not easily be matched in our age, which
was written in the time of King 
Henry
 the 6. ouer the en∣trance
into the 
Reccipt
 at 
Westminster,
 to admonish accon∣tants
to be circumspect in entring, as 
Ianus
 with his two
heads, and as vigilant in ending Exchequer accounts, as

Argus
 with his hundred eyes.


Ingrediens Iani, rediture sis aemulus Argi.




RYTHMES.


RIming verses which are called 
Versus Leonini,
 I know
not wherefore (for a Lions taile doth not answere to
the middle parts as these verses doe) began in the time of

Carolus Magnus,
 and were onely in request then, and in
many ages following, which delighted in nothing more
then in this minstrelsie of meeters. I could present you


with many of them, but few shall suffice, when as there
are but few now which delight in them.


In the praise of 
Miles
 Earle of Hereford,
 was this pen∣ned,
in respect he was both martiall and lettered.

Walter de Mapes
 Archdeacon of 
Oxford,
 who in the time
of King 
Henry
 the second filled England with his meri∣ments,
confessed his loue to good liquor, with the causes, in
this maner.


Mihi est propositum in taberna mori,


Ʋinum sit appositum morientis ori:


Ʋt dicant, cùm venerint, Angelorum chori,


Deus sit propitius huic potatori.


Poculis accenditur animi lucerna,


Cor imbutum nectare volat ad superna,


Mihi sapit dulcius vinum in taberna,


Quàm quod aqua miscuit praesulis pincernn.


Suum cui{que} proprium dat natura munus,


Ego nunquam potui scribere iciunus:


Me iciunum vincere posset puer vnus.


Sitim & iciunium, odi tanquam funus.


Vnicui{que} propriumdat natura donum,


Ego versus faciens, vinum bibo bonum,


Ft quod habent melius dolia cauponum,


Tale vinum generat copiam sermonum.


Tales versus facio, quale vinum bibo,


Nihil possum scribere, nisi sumpto cibo,


Nihil valet penitus, quod iciunus scribo,


Nasonem post caelices carmine praeibo,


Mihi nunquam spiritus prophetiae datur.



Nisi tunc cùm fuerit, venter bene satur


Cum in arce cerebri Bacchus dominatur,


In me Phoebus irruit, ac miranda fatur.


The infirmity and corruption of our nature prone to sensu∣ality
he acknowledgeth thus.


Via lata gradior more iuuentutis,


Implico me vitijs, immenor virtutis,


Voluptatis auidus, magis quam salutis


Mortuus in anima curam gero cutis.


Mihi cordis grauitâs, res videtur grauis,


Iocus est amabilis, dulcior{que} fauis.


Quicquid Venus imperat labor est suauis,


Quae nunquam in mentibus habitat ignauis.


Quis in igne positus igni non vratur?


Quis in mundo demorans castus habeatur?


Vbi Venus digito iuuenes venatur,


Oculis illaqueat, facie praedatur.


This lustie priest when Pope 
Innocent
 the third forbade
the 
Clergie
 their wiues, became Proctor for himselfe, and
them with these verses: desiring onely for his fee, that euery
priest with his sweet hart would say a 
Pater noster
 for him.


Prisciani regula penitùs cassatur,


Sacerdos per Hic et Haec olim declinatur,


Sed per Hic solummodo, nunc articulatur.


Cum per nostrum praesulum Haec amoueatur.


Ita quidem presbyter caepit allegare,


Peccat criminaliter qui vult seperare,


Quod Deus iniunxerat, faeminam amare.


Tales dignum duximus
fures appellare.


O quam dolor anxius, quàm tormentum graue,


Nobis est dimittere, quoniam suaue.


O Romane pontifex, statuisti prauè,


Ne in tanto crimine moriaris, caue.


Non est Innocentius, immò nocens verè,


Qui quod facto docuit studet abolere:


Et quod olim inuenis voluit habere,


Modò vetus pontifex, studet prohibere,




Gignere nos praecipit vetus Testamentum:


Vbi nouum prohibet, nusquam est inuentum.


Praesul qui contrarium donat documentum,


Nullum necessarium his dat argumentum,


Dedit enim dominus maledictionem


Viro qui non fecerit generationem.


Ergo tibi consulo, per hanc rationem,


Gignere, vt habeas benedictionem.


Nonnè de militibus mili

Mery Michaell the Cornish poet piped this vpon his pipe
for mery 
England,
 but with a mocking compassion of 
Nor∣mandy,

when the French vsurped it in the time of K. 
Iohn;


Nobilis Anglie pocula, prandia, donat et aera:


Terra iuuabilis, et sociabilis agmine plena



Omnibus vtilis Anglia fertilis est, et amaena.


Sed miserabilis et lachrimabilis abs{que} cateruà,

He begged his exhibition of King 
Henry
 the third with
this distich.


Regie rector, miles vt Hector, dux vt Achilles,


Te quia sector, melle 
vector,
 mel mihi stilles.


The same 
Michael
 highly offended with 
Henry
 of 
Aurench

the kings Poet for disgracing 
Cornwall,
 thought to draw
bloud of him with these bobbing times.


Est tibi gamba capri, crus passeris, et latus apri,

Quod non a monstro differs: satis hic tibi monstro.


If you please to heare a solemne plea at Reasons barre be∣tweene
the Eye & the Heart, runne ouer this, which a con∣triman
of ours made in time of king 
Henry
 the 3.




Quisquis cordis et oculi


Non sentit in se iurgia,


Non nouit qui sunt stimuli,


Quae culpae seminaria.






Causam nescit periculi,


Cur alternant convitia,


Cur procaces & aemuli


Replicent in se vitia.






Cor sic affatur oculum


Te peccati principium,


Te fontem, te stimulum,


Te mortis voco nuntium.






Tu domus meae ianitor


Hosti non claudis ostium,


Familiaris proditor


Admittis aduersarium.






Nonnè fenestra diceris


Quod mors intrat ad animam;


Nonnè quod vides sequeris



Vt bos ductus ad victimam.






Saltem sordes quas ingeris,


Cur non lauas per lachrimam


Aut quarè non crueris


Mentem fermentans azimam?






Cordi respondet oculus,


Iniustè de me quaereris,


Seruus sum tibi sedulus,


Exequor quicquid iusseris.






Nonne tu mihi praecipis,


Sicut et membris caeteris,


Non ego, tu te decipis,


Nuntius sum quò tu miseris.






Cur damnatur apertio?


Corpori necessaria,


Sine cuius obsequio,


Cuncta languent officia.






Quo si fiat ereptio.


Cum sim fenestra peruia,


Si quod recepi nuntio,


Quae putatur iniuria?






Addo quòd nullo puluere


Quem immitto pollueris,


Nullum malum te laedere


Potest, nisi consenseris.






De corde mala prodeunt


Nihil inuitum pateris,


Virtutes non intereunt,


Nisi culpam commiseris.






Dum sic vter{que} disputat


Soluto pacis osculo:

Dan Elingham
 a Monke of 
Linton
 of Saint 
Benedicts
 or∣der,
comming to the White-friers in 
Nottingham,
 found
there 
Iohn Baptist
 painted in a white Friers weed, where∣at
marueling, he coled out these verses vpon the wall
neere to the picture.


Christi Baptista, vestis non te decet ista,


Qui
e vestiuit fratrem, maledictus abiuit.


Nunquam Messias 
iater fuerat, nec Helias,


Non stat plebs lata, dum sit pro fratre propheta.


Si fratrem Ionam fingis Geezi tibi ponam:


Ac Iebusaeum, ne iungas his Helisaeum.


But a white Frier there answered 
Elingham,
 with these
following in the person of 
Iohn Baptist.


Elingham mentiris, metris fatuis quo{que} miris


At{que} ea quae nescis, sic astruis vt ea quae scis.


Nam deus est testis, decet haec me candida vestis,


Plusquàm te vestis pulla, siue nigra cuculla.


Sum Carmelita meritò, sed tu Geezita.


A
 frater fictus Benedicti, non benedictus.


He which made this when King 
Edward
 the first, and the
Pope concurred in exacting a paiment from the Cleargie,
should haue smarted, had he beene knowne.


Ecclesiae nauis titubat, regni quia clauis


Errat, Rex, Papa facti sunt vnica capa,


Hoc faciunt 
do, des,
 Pilatus hîc alter Herodes.


A merry learned Lawyer which had receiued Wine for a
regarde, or remembrance, from the Abbot of 
Merton,

who had entertained him in a cause, sent these two verses,
as standing vpon his integrity against bribes, and requi∣ring
rather good euidence than good Wine.


Ʋinum transmissum nunc me facit esse remissum,


Conuiuis vina, causis tua iura propina.


The Abbot which perswaded himselfe what would moue
a Lawyer, when Wine could not, returned these three di∣stiches.


Tentaui temerè vinô te, posse movere,


Non movi verè, sed forte moveberis aere.



Ʋinum non quaeris, sed tinnit si sonus aeris,


Et spe duceris, forsitàn alter eris.


Vt mihi sis mitis, tibi misi pocula vitis,


Nec tamen illa sitis desinit, vndè sitis.


King 
Edward
 the third when he first quartered the Armes
of 
France
 with 
England,
 declared his claime in this kinde
of verse, thus.


Rex sum regnorum binâ ratione duorum,


Anglorum regno sum rex ego iure paterno,


Matris iure quidem Francorum nuncupor idem.


Hinc est armorum variatio facta meorum.


These following were made by his Poet, when 
Philip de
Valoys
 the 
French
 King lurked in 
Cambray,
 and so well li∣ked
of him, that he sware by Saint 
George
 they were vali∣ant
verses; and commanded them to be shot vpon an ar∣row
into the Cittie, as a cartell of challenge.


Si valeas, venias Valoys, depelle timorem,


Non lateas, pateas, maneas, ostende vigorem.


In the Chapiter house of 
Yorke
 Minster is written this in
commendation thereof:


Vt rosa flos florum, sic est domus ista domorum.


The Exchequer officers were extortours in the time of
King 
Henry
 the 4, otherwise 
Henry Bell
 Collectour of the
Custome, (as he stileth himselfe at that time,) would neuer
haue written a riming long Satyre against them, which be∣ginneth
thus.


O Scacci Camera, locus est mirabilis ille.


Vt referam vera, tortores sunt ibi mille.


Si contingat ibi temet quid habere patrandum,


Certe dico tibi caetum reperire nefandum.


And concludeth in this maner.


O sic vexatè tortoribus & cruciate


Non dices vere propter tales Miserere.


But this is good aduise, which he giveth to such as haue to
deale with the officers of the Receipt.




Qui tallas scribunt, cum murmure saepè loquuntur,


Summas qui{que} solent in magnâ scribere pelle.


Scribere valdè dolent, dùm non sit soluere bellè.


Escas manè datas propter ientacula pones,


Costas assatas, pisces, pingues{que} capones,


Illos conforta pariter per fortia vina,


Westminster porta, pro talibus est medicina.


Now for the Fleet then, he writeth thus.


Cum sis in Fleta, patioris mille molesta,


Illic dona dabis, si sanus vis fore puncto,


Nam custos Fletae bona de prisonibus vnit,


Ni soluant laete mox hos per vincula punit:


Illis qui baculos portant, ostendere debes,


Valde pios loculos, & ludere praebeo, praebes.


In the time of King 
Henry
 the 4. when in leauying of a
Subsidie, the rich would not, and the poore could not pay,
so they of the meaner sort bare the burthen: a skilfull dicer,
and no vnskilfull rimer wrote these verses.


Dews As
 non possunt, & 
Sise Sinke
 soluere nolunt,


Est igitùr notum, 
Cater Tre
 soluere totum.


Of the decay of gentry one made these rimes.


Ex quo nobilitas seruilia caepit amare,


Nobilitas caepit cum seruis degenerare.


Many more and of great varietie of meeters in this kinde I
could present you with all, for these rimers haue as curious
obse
ations in their 
Arte Rithmizandi,
 as the 
Italian
 ma∣kers,
in their 
Stanzas, Quartetts, Tercetts, Octaves:
 but now
they are counted long eared which delight in them.


Beside these, our Poets hath their knacks as young Schol∣lers
call them, as 
Ecchos, Achrostiches, Serpentine
 verses,

Recurrents, Numeralls, &c.
 yea and our prose Authors
could vse 
Achrostiches,
 for 
Ranulph
 of 
Chester
 began the
first Chapter of his 
Polychronicon
 with 
P,
 the 2. with 
R,

the 3. with 
E.
 the 4. with 
S.
 the fift with 
N.
 and so forth,
as if you would spell the first Chapters of his Booke, you,
shall find, 
Praesentem chronicam compilauit Ranulphus Mo∣nachus
Cestrensis.
 And why not as well as 
Agapetus
 the


Greeke, who did the like in his admonitions to 
Iustinian

the Emperour.


But I will end with this of 
Odo,
 houlding Maister Doc∣tors
Mule, and 
Anne
 with her table-cloth: which cost the
maker much foolish labour, for it is a perfect verse, and
euery word is the very same, both backward and forward.


Odo tenet mulum, madidam mappam tenet Anna.


Anna tenet mappam madidam, mulum tenet Odo.






Epitaphes.


G
Reat hath bene the care of burial euen
since the first times, as you may see by
the examples of Abraham, Iacob, Io∣seph,
Iosua, the old prophet in Bethel,
and Tobie; and also by that in holy
scriptures: 
Mortuo ne deneges gratiam.

The Iews annoynted the dead bodies,
wrapped them in sindon, layed them in couered sepulchers
hewed out of stone: The 
Aegyptians
 embalmed and filled
them with odoriferous spices, reseruing them in glasse or
coffins, the 
Assirians
 in wax and hony, the 
Scythians
 caried
about the cleansed carkases to the freinds of the deceased
for 40. daies with solemne banquets. And that we may not
particulate, the 
Romaines
 so far exceeded in funerall ho∣nors,
and ceremonyes, with oyntments, images, bonfires of
most precious woods, sacrifices, & banquets, burning their
dead bodies vntill about the time of 
Theodosius,
 that lawes
were enacted to restraine the excesse. Neither haue any
neglected buriall, but some sauage nations as Bactrians,
(which cast the dead to their doggs) some varlet Philoso∣phers,
as 
Diogenes
 which desired to be deuoured of fishes,
some dissolute courtiers as 
Mecaenas,
 who was wont to say.


Non tumulum curo, sepelit natura relictos.


As an other said.


De terra in terram, & quaeuis terra sepulchrum.



Yea some of especiall note amongst vs neglecting the last
duty eyther vpon a sparing or a precise humour, are content
to commit to the earth their parents, wiues, and the nearest
vnto them 
in tenebris
 with little better than 
Sepultura asi∣norum.

As for those which philosophically dislike monu∣ments
and memorialls after their death, and those that af∣fect
them, I thinke as 
Plinie
 did, speaking of 
Virginius,
 and

Apronius:
 that both of them do ambitiously march with
like paces toward glory, but by diuerse wayes, these open∣ly,
in that they desire their due titles, those other couertly, in
that they would seeme carlesly to contemne them.


But among all funerall honours Epitaphes haue alwaies
bene most respectiue, for in them loue was shewed to the
deceased, memory was continued to posterity, friends were
comforted, and the reader put in mind of humane fraiel∣ty.


The inuention of them proceeded from the presage or
forfeeling of immortality implanted in all men naturally,
and is referred to the schollers of 
Linus,
 who first bewayled
their maister when he was slaine, in dolefull verses then
called of him 
Aelinum,
 afterward 
Epitaphia,
 for that they
were first song at Burialls, after engraued vpon the sepul∣chers.


It were needlesse to set downe heere the lawes of 
Plato,

that an 
Epitaph
 should be comprised in foure verses, or
of the Lacedemonians, who reserued this honor only to
Martiall men, and chast women: or how the most ancient,
(especially Greeke) were written in 
Elegiac
 verse, after in
prose:


How monuments were erected most vsually along the
high waye side, to put passengers in minde that they are,
as those were mortall.


How such as violated sepulchres were punished with
death, banishment, condemnation to the mines, losse of
members, according to circumstance of fact aud person,
and how sacred they were accompted.


In which regard I cannot but giue you the words out


of the
 Nouellae leges Valentiniani Augusti: De Sepulchris
titulo. v. 
which are worth reading
 Scimus, nec vana fides,
& solutas membris animas habere sensum, & in originem su∣am
spiritum redire caelestem. Hoc libris veteris sapientiae, hoc
religionis, quam veneramur & colimus, declaratur arcanis.
Et licaet occasus necessitatem mens diuina non sentiat, amani
tamen animae sedem corporum relictorum, & nescio qua sorte
rationis occultae sepulchri honore laetantur: cuius tanta per∣maneat
cura temporibus, vt videamus in hos vsus sumptu ni∣mio
praetiosa montium metalla transferri, operosas{que} moles
censu laborante componi. Quod prudentium certè intelligentia
recusaret, si nihil crederet esse post mortem. Nimis barbara
est & vesana crudelitas, munus extremum luce carentibus
inuidere, & dirutis per inexpiabile crimē sepulchris, monstra∣re
caelo corporum reliquias humatorum. 
Against which I
cannot without griefe remember, how barbarously, and
vnchristianly some not long since haue offended, yea some

Mingendo in patrios cineres, 
which yet we haue seene
strangely reuenged.


I could here also call to your remembrance how the
place of buriall was called by S. 
Paul Seminatio,
 in the
respect of the assured hope of resurrection, of the Greekes

Caemiterion,
 as a sleeping place vntill the resurrection, and
of the Hebrews 
The house of the liuing
 in the same respect,
as the Germaines call Churchyardes vntill this day 
Gods
aker,
 or 
Gods field.
 And in the like sence tombes were na∣med

Requietoria, Ossuaria, Cineraria, Domus aeternae,
 &c.
As you may see in ould inscriptions at 
Rome,
 and else∣where.
Which 
Lucian
 scoffingly termed 
Campes
 and

Cottages
 of 
Carkases.


Notorious it is to all how the same 
Lucian
 bringeth in

Diogenes
 laughing and outlaughing King 
Mausolus
 for
that he was so pitifully pressed and chrushed with an huge
heape of stones vnder his stately monument 
Mausoleum.

for the magnificence accompted among the worlds won∣ders:
But monuments answerable to mens worth, states,
and places, haue alwaies bene allowed, yet stately sepul∣chers


for base fellowes haue alwayes lyen open to bit∣ter
iests, as that marble one of 
Licinus
 the barber, which
one by way of comparison thus derided, with a doubt
thereon, whether God regarded men of worth.


Marmoreo Licinus tumulo iacet, at Cato paruo,


Pompeius nullo. Credimus esse Deos?


Whereunto another replied with an assurance that God
doth regard worthy men.


Saxa premunt Licinum, vehit altum fama Catonem,


Pompetum tituli, Cedimus esse Deos.


As for such as bury themselues liuing, and say they liue
to themselues, when they liue neither to themselues, nor
to other, but to their belly, ease, and pleasure, wel worthy
are they to haue while they liue, that Epitaph which 
Sene∣ca

deuised for 
Vatia
 their fellow to be inscribed vpon his
house, 
Hic situs est Vatia.
 and no memoriall at all when
they are dead.


It is not impertinent to note in one worde as the aun∣cient
Romans beganne Epitaphes with D. M. for 
Dijs
Manibus. D. M. S. i. Dijs Manibus sacrum. Hic situs est.
Hospes,
 as speaking to the reader. So we & other Christians
began them with 
Hic deponitur, Hic iacet, Hic requiescit,
Hic tumulatur▪
 in French 
Icy gist. Here lieth.
 and in latter
time according to the doctrine of the time 
Ora pro. &c. Of
your charity, &c.
 And now after the auncient manner 
D.
O. M.
 for 
Deo. Optimo. Maximo. Posteritati Sacrum.
Memoriae Sacrum. Deo & Posteris. Virtuti & Honori
Sacrum. &c.


Likewise as our Epitaphes were concluded with

On whose soule God haue mercy. Cuius animae prepitietur
Deus. 
God send him a ioyfull resurrection.
 &c. 
So theirs
with,
 Hoc Monumentum posuit vel fecit, 
in these letters.

M. P. M. F. 
in the behalfe of him that made the Monu∣mente.
With
 Vale, Vale, & Salue anima, nos eo ordine quo
natura iusserit. sequemur. 
With
 H. M. H. N. S: 
for
 Hoc
monumentum haeredes non sequitur. 
When they would
not haue their heires entombed therein; with
 Rogo per


Deos superos inferos{que} ossa nostra ne violes, 
And most
commonly with
 Sit tibi terra leuis 
in these notes,
 S. T. T. L.

And somtime with
 Quietem posteri non inuideant.


But omitting this discourse I will offer vnto your view
a 
Century
 of choise Epitaphes of our nation for matter
and conceit, some good, some bad, that you may see how
learning ebbed and flowed: most of them recouered from
the iniury of time by writers. And will beginne with that
at Rome as most auncient erected to the memory of a
Britanne; who after the maner of the time, tooke a 
Romane

name.

Arthur
 the valerous vpholder of the ruinous state
of Britaine against the Saxons about the yeare 500. was
buried secretly at Glastenburie, least the enimie should
offer indignity to the dead body, and about 700. yeares
after when a graue was to be made in the Churchyard
there, a stone was found betweene two 
Pyramides
 deepe
in the ground with a crosse of lead infixed into the lower
part thereof, and inscribed in the inner side of the crosse
in rude Characters, which the Italians now call Gotish
letters.

Vnder which in a trough of Oke were found his
bones, which the Monkes, translated into the church and
honoured them with a tombe, but dishonored him with
these horne pipe verses.


Hic iacet

Quem morum probitas commendat laude perenni.


Augustine the first Archbishop of Canterbury, who first
preached Christ to the English nation, conuerted the
Kentishmen, & reuiued Christianity in this Isle, which flou∣rished
among the Britaines, many years before his cōming,


was buried at 
Canterbury
 in 
S. Peters
 Porch, with this
Epitaph.


Hic requiescit dominus Augustinus Dorobernensis Ar∣chiepiscopus
primus, qui 
lim huc a beato Gregorio Re∣manae
vrbis pontifice directus, & a Deo operatione mira∣culorum
suffultus Aethelbertum regem, ac gentem
illius ab idolorum cultu ad Christi fidem perduxit. &
completis in pace diebus officij sui, defunctus est septimo
Kalendas Iunias, eodem rege regnante:


In the same place were interred the sixe succeeding Arch∣bishops,
for whom and 
Augustin
 making the seauenth,
were these verses, as cōmon to them all, written on the wall
with this title: as I finde them in 
Geruasius Dorobernensis.






Septem primae ecclesiae Anglorum

Augustinus, Laurentius, Mellitus, Iustus, Honorius. Deus-dedit. Theodorus.


Septem sunt Anglis primates & protopatres,


Septem rectores, caelo septem{que} triones,


Septem cisternae vitae, septem{que} lucernae,


Et septem palmae regni, septem{que} coronae


Septem sunt stellae quas haec tenet area cellae:


But 
Theodore
 the last of the 7. which first taught 
Greeke

in 
England,
 and died in the yeare 713. had this seuerally
inscribed vpon his tombe.


Scandens alma nouae foelix consortia vitae


Ciuibus Angelicis iunctus in arce poli.


Cedwall
 King of the 
West Saxons
 went to 
Rome
 in the
yeare 689. & there being Baptized, renounced the world,
ended his life, and lieth buried with this Epitaph.


Culmen, opes, sobolem, pollentia regna, triumphos


Exuuias, proceres, mania, castra, lares.


Quae{que} patrum virtus, & quae congesserat ipse,

With some more which you may see in 
Paulus Diaconus,

and 
Beda:



King 
Eadgar
 surnamed the 
Peaceable,
 the great patron
and fauourer of Monkes, deserued well for his foundation
of so many Abbayes this Epitaph.

To the honor of King

Nec tamen aut ferro contritus ponere ferrum,


Aut gladio potuit vitae finisse labores.


Iam post transactos vitae regni{que} labores


Christus ei sit vera quies, et vita perennis.


It is meruailous how immediately after this time lear∣ning
decayed in this Kingdome, for 
Iohn Erigena
 alias

Scotus,
 fauoured of 
Charles
 the 
Bald
 King of France, and
the forsaid King 
Alfred
 for his learning, when he was stab∣bed
by his schollers at 
Malmesbury
 was buried with this
rude, rough and vnlearned verse.


Clauditur in tumulo Sanctus Sophista Iohannes


Qui ditatus erat, iam viuens dogmate miro.


Martyrio tandem Christi conscendere regnum



Quo meritis, regnant sancti per secula cuncti.


And from this time learning so lowe ebbed in 
England

that betweene Thames & Trent, there was scant one found
which could vnderstand Latin, and that you may perceiue,
when as 
Hugolin
 Treasurer to King 
Edward
 the Confessor,
had these most sillie verses in grauen vpon his monument in
the olde Chapter house of Westminster.


Qui ruis iniustè capit hic Hugoline locus te,


Laude pia clares, qnia martyribus nece clares:


But shortly after the Conquest learning reuiued, as appea∣reth
by these that follow, which were cast in a more lear∣ned
mould than the former.


King 
William
 surnamed the 
Conqueror
 for his conquest of

England,
 was buried at 
Caen
 in 
Normandie,
 with this Epi∣taph,
discouered in the late ciuill warres of 
France,
 but men∣tioned
in 
Gemeticensis.


Qui rexit rigidos Normannos at{que} Britannos,


Audacter vicit, fortiter obtinuit:


Et Caenomanenses virtute contudit enses,


Imperij{que} sui legibus applicuit.


Rex magnus parua iacet his Gulielmus in vrna:


Sufficit & magno paruae domus domino.


Ter septem gradibus se voluerat at{que} duobus,


Virginis in gremio Phoebus, et hic obijt.


Vpon 
Stigand
 Archbishop of 
Canterbury
 degraded for his
corruptiō, I finde this most viperous Epitaph in an olde Ma∣nuscript.


Hic iacet Herodes Herode ferocior, huius


Inquinat infernum spiritus, ossa solum.


William
 the Valiant, Earle of 
Flaunders,
 nephew to this
King 
William
 the Conquerour, sonne to 
Robert,
 who vn∣happy
in his state, loosing the hope of the Kingdome of
England, & dying of a wound in his hand, was not altoge∣ther
vnhappy in his Poet, which made him this Epitaph.


Vnicus ille ruit, cuius non terga sagittam,


Cuius nosse pedes non potuere fugam.


Nil nisi fulmen erat, quoties res ipsa mouebat,


Et si non fulmen, fulminis instar erat:



King 
Henry
 the first, for his learning surnamed 
Beauclerc,

had this flatterng Epitaph, as Poets could flatter in all ages.


Rex Henricus obit, decus olim, nunc dolor orbis,


Numina flent numen deperijsse suum.


Mercurius minor eloquio, vi mentis Apollo,


Iupiter imperio, Mars{que} vigore gemunt.


Anglia quae curá, quae sceptro Principis huius,


Ardua splenduerat, tam tenebrosa ruit.


Haec cum rege suo, Normania cum Duce marcet,


Nutrijt haec puerum, perdidit illa virum.


Of him also another composed these in respect of his peace∣able
gouernment, and the troubles which ensued vnder
King 
Stephen,
 both in England and Normandie.


Anglia Iugeat hinc, Normannica gens fleat illinc,


Occidit Henricus modò lux, nunc luctus vtri{que}


Vpon 
William
 sonne of, King 
Henry
 the first, and heire ap∣parent
of this Realme, drowned vpon the coast of 
Norman∣die,

I haue found this Epitaphe.


Abstulit hunc terrae matri maris vnda nouerca,


Proh dolor? occubuit Sol Anglicus, Anglia plora:


Quae{que} priùs fueras gemino radiata nitore,


Extincto nato viuas contenta parente.


But well it was with England in that he was so preuented,
which threatned to make the English draw the Plough as
Oxen. (
Hypodigma
)


Mawd
 daughter to the foresaid King, wife to 
Henry
 the
Emperour, mother to King 
Henry
 the 2. who intitled her
selfe Empresse & 
Augusta,
 for that she was thrice solemn∣ly
crowned at 
Rome
 as 
R. de Diceto
 test fieth, & 
Anglorum
Domina,
 because she was heire apparent to the crowne of
Englād, was very happy in her Poet, who in these 2. funerall
verses, contained her princely parentage, match, & issue.


Magna ortis, maior{que} viro, sed maxima partu,


Hic iacet Henrici filia, sponsa, parens.


Alberic Vere
 graundfather to the first Earle of 
Oxford,
 and
his sonne 
William
 were buried together Anno 1088. with
this Epitaphe at 
Colne
 where he was founder & afterward
Monke, as it is in the Annales of Abingdon.




En puer, en senior, pater alter, filius alter,


Legem, fortunam, terram venêre sub vnam:


In which the maker seemed to imitate that of 
Conrad
 the
Emperour at 
Spires
 in Germany.


Filius hîc, pater hîc, annus hî, proauus iacet istic.


Thomas Beket
 Arch-bishop of Canterbury had these Epi∣taphes
expressing the cause, the time, & place of his death,
made by his especiall fauourer.


Pro Christi sponsa, Christi sub tempore, Christi


In templo, Christi verus amator obit


Quinta dies natalis erat, flos orbis ab orbe


Carpitur, et fructus incipit esse poli.


Quis morritur? praesul. cur? pro grege. qualiter? ense:


Quando? natali. quis locus? ara Dei.


For 
Theobald
 of 
Bloys
 Earle of Champaine nephew to
King 
Henry
 the first. 
Giraldus Cambrensis
 Bishop of S. 
Da∣uids

in 
Walles
 made this.


Ille comes, Comes ille pius Theobaldus eras, quem


Gaudet habere polus, terra carere dolet.


Non hominem possum, non audeo dicere numen:


Mors probat hunc hominem, vita fuisse Deum.


Trans hominem, citra{que} Deum, plus hoc, minus istud,


Nescio qui
 neuter, inter vtrum{que} fuit:


Vitalis
 Abbot of Westminster which died in the time of
the Conquerour, had this Epitaph:


Qui nomen traxit a vita, morte vocante


Abbas Vitalis transijt, hic{que} iacet:


And for 
Lawrence
 Abbot of the same place which died
1176. was made this alluding to his name:


Pro meritis vitae dedit isti Laurea nomen,


Detur ei vitae laurea pro meritis.


These two happely, may finde as much fauour with some
if one word do not preiudice, as that auncient one of 
Flori∣dus

so highly commended.


Quod vixi flos est, seruat lapis hic mihi nomen,


Nolo Deos manes, flos mihi pro titulo.




Geruays de Bloys
 base sonne to King 
Stephen,
 and Abbot
also of the same church was buried with the foresaid in the
cloyster with this.


De Regum genere pater hic Geruasius ecce


Monstrat defunctus, mors rapit omne genus:


William de Albeney
 Erle of 
Arundel,
 and Butler to the
King, was buried at 
Wimodham
 which he founded with
this.


Hunc Pincerna locum fundauit, & hîc iacet alla


Quae dedit huic domui, tam sine fine tenet.


That mighty Monarch King 
Henry
 the second, which
by his owne right adioyned 
Anioy, Maine
 and 
Tourain,
 by
his wife 
Aquatine, Poyctov,
 and by conquest Ireland to the
Crowne of England, and commanded from the 
Pyrene

mountaines to the 
Orcades,
 had this Epitaph according to
his greatnesse.


Rex Henricus eram, mihi plurima regna subegi


Multiplici{que} modo, Dux{que} Comes{que} fui.


Cui satis ad votum non essent omnia terrae


Climata, terra modo sufficit octo pedum.


Qui legis haec pensa discrimina mortis, et in me


Humanae speculum conditionis habe.


Sufficit hic tumulus, cui non suffecerat orbis.


Res breuis ampla mihi, cui fuit ampla breuis:


Rosamond
 the faire his paramour, daughter to 
Walter
 Lord

Clifford,
 and mother to William 
Longspee,
 the first Earle of
Sarisbury aeternised by maister 
Daniels
 muse, had this no∣thing
answerable to her beauty.


Hac iacet in tumba rosa mundi non Rosamunda,


Non redolet, sed olet quae redolere solet.


William 
Longspee
 Earle of 
Sarum,
 base sonne to King

Henry
 the second by this Lady, had an Epitaph not vnlike
to that of his mother.


Flos comitum Willielmus cognomine longus


Ensis, vaginam caepit habere breuem.


The glory of that magnanimous and lionlike prince
king 
Richard
 the first, renowned for his Conquest of 
Cy∣prus.



The king whereof he tooke and kept in setters of
siluer, and for his great exployts in the holy land stirred
vp the wits of the best Poets in that age, to honor him, with
these Epitaphs which follow, when he was slaine in view∣ing
the Castle of 
Chaluz
 in 
Limosin.


Hic Richarde iaces, sed mors si cederet armis


Victa timore tui, cederet ipsa tuis:


Another also writt of him.


Istius in morte perimit formica leonem:


Proh dolor, in tanto funere, mundus obit.


An English poet imitating the epitaph made of 
Pompey
 &
his children, whose bodies were buried in diuerse contries,
made these following of the glory of this one king deui∣ded
in three places by his funerall.


Viscera Carccolum, corpus fons seruat Ebrandi,


Et cor Rothomagum magne Richarde tuum.


In tria diuiditur vnus, qui plus fuit vno:


Non vno iaceat gloria tanta loco.


At 
Font Euerard
 where his body was enterred with a
gilt image, were these sixe excellent verses written in
golden letters, contayning his greatest and most glori∣ons
atchieuementes: as his victory against the 
Sicilians,

his conquering of 
Cyprus,
 the sinkinge of the great 
Ga∣liasse

of the 
Saracens,
 the taking of their Conuoie, which
in the East partes is called a 
Caruana,
 and the defending
of 
Ieppe
 in the holye land against them:

Scribitur hoc tumulo Rex auree, laus tua, tota


Aurea, materiae conueniente notâ.


Laus tua prima fuit Siculi, Cyprus altera, Dromo


Tertia, Caruena quarta, suprema Iope.


Suppressi Siculi, Ciprus pessundata. Dromo


Mersus, Caruana capta, retenta Iope.


But sharpe and satyrical was that one verse, which by allu∣ding
noted his taking the Chalices from Churches for his
ransome, and place of his death which was called 
Chaluz.


Christe tui calicis praedo sit praeda Caluzis.




Sauaricus
 Bishop of Bath and Wells a stirring prelate,
which laboured most for the redeeming King 
Richard,

when he was captiue in 
Austria,
 and is famous in the de∣cretalls
(
lib. 3. tit. 9. 0 Nouit ille
) had this Epitaph, for that
he was alwayes gadding vp and downe the world, and had
little rest.


Hospes erat mundo per mundum semper eundo,


Sic suprema diès, fit sibi prima quies.


And the like in late yeares was engrauen vpon the monu∣ment
of 
Iacobus Triulcio
 a military man of the same metall,
as 
Lodonic Guicciardin
 reporteth.


HIC MOR TVVS REQVIESSCIT SEMEL.


QVI VIVVS REQVIEVIT NVNQVAM.


But 
imilis
 Captaine of the guard to 
Adrian
 the Em∣peror,
when he had passed a most toylesome life, after
he had retired himselfe from seruice, and liued priuatly 7.
yeares in the countrie,
 acknowledged that he had liued on∣ly
them 7. yeares, as he caused to be inscribed vpon his mo∣nument
thus.


Hic iacet Similis cuius aetas multorum


annorum fuit, ipse septem duntaxat


annos vixit.


It may be doubted whether 
Wulgrine
 the Organist was so
good a Musician, as 
Hugh
 Archdeacon of Yorke was a Po∣et,
which made this Epitaph for him.


Te Wulgrine cadente cadunt vox, organa, cantus,


Et quicquid gratum gratia vocis habet.


Voce, lira, modulis, Syrenes, Orphea, Phoebum


Vnus tres poteras aequiperare tribus.


Si tamen illorum non fallet fama locorum,


Quod fueras nobis, hoc eris Eliijs.


Cantor eris, qui cantor eras, hic charus et illî,


Orpheus alter eras, Orpheus alter eris.


Vpon one 
Peter
 a religious man of this age I found
this.


Petra capit Petri cineres, animam Petra Christus.


Sic sibi diuisit vtra{que} petra Petrum.



Vpon the death of 
Morgan
 base sonne of king 
Henry
 the 2.
was made this Epitaph, alluding to his name in that allu∣ding
age.


Larga, benigna, decens, iacet his stirps regia, morum,


Organa Morgano fracta iacente, silent:


In the time of king 
Henry
 the third they began to make
Epitaphs, as they call it now out of 
Propria quae maribus,
 as
some do in our age, but among them this was short and
good for William Erle of 
Pembroke
 and Marshall of Eng∣land,
buried in the Temple church.


Sum quem Saeturnum sibi sensit Hibernia, Solem


Anglia, Mercurium Normannia, Gallia Martem.


And this was not bad for 
Richard de Clare,
 Erle of 
Gloce∣stor

and 
Hertford
 which died, Anno 1262.


Hic pudor Hippoliti, Paridis gena, sensus Vlissis,


Aeneae pietas, Hectoris ira iacet.


I doubt not but this time of Simon 
Montfort
 Earle of

Leicester,
 slaine at 
Euesham
 found fauour in that age, as the
Earle himselfe who was so followed by the people, that he
durst confront his soueraigne king 
Henry
 the 3. and as the
Epitaph doth implie, was the peerelesse man of that time,
for valour, personage, and wisdome.


Nunc dantur fato, casu{que} cadunt iterato


Simone sublato, Mars, Paris, at{que} Cato.


Vpon a gentleman as some thinke named 
None
 buried at

Wimondham
 who gaue nothing to the religīous there, was
made this.


Hîc situs est Nullus, quia nullo nullior iste;


Et quia nullus erat, de nullo nil tibi Christe.


Excellent is this (which I found in the booke of 
Wimond∣ham
)
for Pope 
Lucius
 borne at 
Luca,
 Bishop of 
Ostia
 Pope
of 
Rome,
 and dying at 
Verona.


Luca dedit lucem tibi Luci, Pontificatum


Ostia, Papatum Roma, Verona mori.


Imo Verona dedit tibi verè viuere, Roma


Exilium, curas Ostia, Luca mori.


If you will see an ould Deane named 
Ham
 Sol,
 resembled


to the twelue sonnes of olde father 
Annus
 which had e∣uery
one as 
Cleobulus
 was wont to call them thirty daugh∣ters,
some faire, some foule, all dying and neuer dying,, read
this epitaph.


Participat mensis dotes cuiuslibet Hamo


Circumspectus erat vt Ianus, crimina purgans,


Vt Februus, veterana nouans vs Martius ipse,


Semina producens vt Ap
ilis flore coruscans,


Vt Maiu

Feruens vt Iulius, frugis maturi

Septembris, replens vino cellaria more


Octobris, p

More Nouembris epulator dapsilis instar,


Omne Decembris habet hiemalis peste quiescens.


Another playing vpon the name 
Hamon
 made this for him

Olim piscator hominum quasi pisces ab hamo


Mortis captus hamo, celebrat conuiuia vitae.

But witty was this, whereas he died in a Leape yeare vpon
the leape day accounted so vnhappy a day of the Romans
that 
Valentinian
 the Emperour durst not peepe out in that
day: one, made this:

Hamo Decane iaces, toto fugit exul ab anno


Interitum Solis, ausa videre dies.

Verely he was a man of some good note in that time, for I
finde another of him alluding also to this leape day.


Nulla dies anni nisi bisextilis, et anni


Iudicio damnata sui, nec subdita mensi,


Sed noctis lux instar erat, lux nescia lucis,


Et lux existens inter luces, quasi bubo,


Inter aues, huius poterat concludere vitam


Solis, et humanum genus hac priuare lucerna.


Alexāder 
Nechā
 a great learned man of this age, as appea∣reth
by his books 
de diuinae sapientiae laudibus,
 was buried in
the cloister at Worcester with this, but deserued a better.


Eclipsim patitur sapientia: sol sepelitur;


Qui dum vinebat, studij genus omne vigebat:



Soluitur in cineres Neccham, cui si foret haeres


In terris vnus, minus esset flebile funus.


A mery mad maker as they call poets now was he which
in the time of K. 
Henry
 the 3. made this for 
Iohn Calf.


O Deus omnipotens vituli miserere Iohannis,


Quem mors praeucaiens noluit esse bouem.


Robert de Courtn
y
 was buried at Ford, as appeareth by the
register of that place 12 
2. vnder a stately Piramis, who
whether he was descen
ed from the Earles of 
Eodessa,
 or
from Petre the sōne of 
 the Grosse K. of Frāce, had but
this bad inscriptiō which I insert more for the honor of the
name, then the worth of the verse.


Hic iacet ingenui de Courtney gleba Roberti,


Militis egregij, virtutum laude referti.


Quem genuit strenuus Reginal dus Courteniensis


Qui procer eximius fuerat tunc deuoniensis.


A Mōke of Duresme busied his braine in nicking out these
nice verses vpon the death of 
W. de La-march
 Chauncellor
of England vnder king 
Iohn.


Culmina qui cupitis


Laudes pompas{que} sititis


Est sedata sitis


Si me pensare velitis


Qui populos regitis

William 
de valentia
 cōmonly called 
Valens
 Earle of Pem∣broke,
& halfe brother to K. 
Henry
 the 3. from whom, the
Earles of Shrewsbury, Kent, and others are descended, is
intombed at Westminster, with these ranke rimes.


Anglia tota doles, moritur quia regia proles,


Qua slorere soles, quam continet infima moles:


Guilelmus nomen insigne valentia praebet


Celsum cognomen, nam tale dari sibi debet


Qui valuit validus, vincens virtute valore


Et placuit placido sensu, morum{que} vigore.


Robert Grostest
 cōmonly called 
Robin Groshead
 bishop of
Lincolne, a most learned prelate, reported by Mathew 
Pa∣ris



to be a seuere reproouer of the Pope, a fauourer of lear∣ning,
a searcher of scriptures, a preacher of the word, & ge∣nerally
a man of great worth cōmanded this only to be en∣grauen
ouer his Tombe.


Quis sim nosse cupis? caro putrida, nil nisi vermis;


Quisquis es, hoc de me sit tibi scire satis.


But vpon his death this was written.


Rex dolet ac regnum gemit, et flet Anglia tota,


Plebs plangit gemitus ingeminare iuuat,


Quippe Grosredus speculum, virtutis, asylum


Iust
ciae, Regis inchora morte iacet.


Non poterit tamen ille mori, cui fama perorat,


Laus loquitur, redolet fructus, abundat honor,


Vnde 
 tristatur homo, canit Angelus inde,


Vnde serenantur sidera, pallet humus.


Vpon the tombe of doctor 
Iohn Bekingale
 somtime bishop
of Chichester this is engrauen which I set here, for rare
correspondency of the rime.


Tu modo qualis eris? quid mundi quaeris honores?


Crimina deplores, in me nunc te speculeris:


En mors ante fores, quae clamitat omnibus adsum


In paenis passum, pro me te deprecor ores.


Which is the same in sence with that at 
Geneua.


VIXI VT VIVIS

Lewes de Beaumont
 that learned bishop of 
Duresme,
 who
was preferred therunto for his affinity vnto the Queene, al∣though
he could not with all his learning read this word

Metropoli
ice
 at his cōsecration, but passed it ouer with 
Soit
pour dict.
 and would sweare by S. 
Lewes
 that they were dis∣courteous,
which set downe so many hard words in the or∣dering
of priests, had this vpon his tombe in Duresme
Church where he was buried 1333.


De Bello Monte iacet hic Lodouicus humatus,


Nobilis ex fonte regum, Comitum{que} creatus &c.


King 
Edward
 the first a most worthy, and mighty prince
the first establisher of the kingdome of England, had affix∣ed


at the Aulter of S. 
Edward
 neare his tombe at 
Westmin∣ster,

a large Epitaph in prose, whereof I haue found onely
this fragment.

The famous K. 
Edward
 the 3. which had so great victo∣ries
ouer the 
French,
 to the greater glory than good of
England as some say, is entombed at 
Westminster
 with
this.

Robert Hawley
 a valiant Esquire, was murthered in

Westminster
 Church in seruice time, where he had taken
sanctuary, and is there buried in the place, where he was
first assaulted with these verses.


Me dolus, ira, furor, multorum militis at{que},

should the memory be of Sir 
Mathew G

Henry Chichely
 although he was founder of 
All Soules
Colledge
 in 
Oxford,
 and an especiall furtherer of learning,
was but little honoured by this vnlearned Epitaph 1443.


Pauper eram natus, post Primas his releuatus


Iam sum prostratus, & vermibus esca paratus,


Ecce meum tumulum:


His next successour one 
Iohn Kempe,
 happened vpon a bet∣ter
Poet, who in one verse comprehended all his dignities
which were great.






Thomas Kempe.


Bis Primas, ter praesul erat, bis cardine functus.


For he was Bishop of 
Rochester, Chichester,
 and 
London,

Archbishop of 
Yorke,
 then of 
Canterbury,
 and Cardinall,
first Deacon, than Priest.


This that followeth is engrauen about a faire tombe in
a goodly Chappell adioyning to the Quire of Saint 
Ma∣ries

Church in 
Warwick,
 being a worthy monument of so
noble a person, since whose time although but late, you
may obserue a great change both of the heyres of his
house, and the vse of words in this Epitaph.



Pray deuoutly for the soule whome God asso
le of one of the
most worshipfull Knights in his dayes of manhood and
cunning, 
Richard B
auchampe
 late Earle of Warwicke,
Lord dispenser of 
Bergeuenny,
 and of many other great
Lordships, whose body resteth here vnder this tombe, in a
full faire vaulte of stone, set in the bare roche. The which
visited with long sicknesse, in the castle of 
Rohan,
 therein
deceased full Christianly the last day of Aprill, in the
yeare of our Lord God 1439. he being at that time Lieu∣tenant
generall of 
France,
 and of the Duchie of 
Nor∣mandie,

by sufficient authoritie of our Soueraigne Lord
King 
Henry
 the sixt. The which body by great delibera∣tion
and worshipfull conduct, by sea and by land, was
brought to 
Warwicke
 the fourth of October, the yeare
abou
said, and was laid with full solemne exequies in a
faire Chest made of Stone, in the West dore of this Chap∣pell,
according to his last Will and Testament therein to
rest, till this Chappell by him deuised in his life were
made, the which Chappell founded on the Roche, and all
the members therof his executors did fully make, & ap∣parail,
by the auctority of his said last Will & Testament.
And therafter by the said auctoritie, they did translate
worshipfully the said body into the vaulte aforesaid:
Honoured be God therefore.


His sister the Countesse of 
Shrewsbury

 on his syd, and of 

moders side Lady 
Lisle,
 and 
Ties,
 which Countesse passed
from this world the xiiii, day of Iune, the yeare of our
Lord 1468. On whose soule the Lord haue mercy.


For that valerous Earle her husband the terror of 
France,

I found no Epitaph, but insteed thereof I will giue you 
o
vnderstand, that not long since his sworde was found in the
riuer of 
Dordon,
 and solde by a pesant to an Armorour of

Burdeaux,
 with this inscription, but pardon the Latin, for
it was not his, but his Camping priests.

SVM TALBOTI M.IIII.C.XLIII.

PRO VINCERE INIMICO MEO.


This inscription following is in the Cathedrall Church at

Roan
 in 
Normandie,
 for 
Iohn
 Duke of 
Bedford,
 and Go∣uernour
of 
Normandie,
 Sonne to King 
Henry
 the fourth,
buried in a faire plaine monument; which when a 
French

Gentleman aduised 
Charles
 the eight 
French
 King to de∣face,
as being a monument of the 
English
 victories, he said:
Let him rest in peace now he is dead, whom we feared
while he liued.


Cy gist feu de noble memoire haut & puissant, prince
Iean en son viuant regent du Royaume de France, Duc
de Bethfort, pour lequel est fondè vne Messe estre par

Vpon an auncient Knight Sir 
Iernegan
 buried Crosse-legd
in Somerly in 
Suffolke
 some hundred yeares since, is writ∣ten:

Iesus Christ both God and man,


Saue thy seruant 
Iernegan.

Happy & prudent K. 
Henry
 the 7. who stopped the streames
of ciuill bloud, which so long ouer-flowed 
England,
 & left
a most peaceable state to his posteritie, hath his magnificall
monument at 
Westminster,
 inscribed thus:




Septimus hic situs est Henricus gloria regum


Cunctorum illius qui tempestate fuerunt,


Ingenio at{que} opibus gestarum nomine rerum:


Accessere quibus naturae dona benignae,


Frontis honos, facies augusta, heroica forma


Iuncta{que} ei suauis coniunx perpulchra, pudica


Et faecunda fuit, foelices prole parentes,


Henricum quibus octauum terra Anglia debes.


Hic iacet Henricus, huius nominis VII. Angliae quondam
rex Edmundi Richmundiae Comitis filius, qui die 22. Aug.
Rex creatus, statim post apud Westmonasterium 30. Octob.
coronatur, anno Domini. 1485. moritur deinde xxi April.
anno aetatis Liii. Regnauit annos xxii. mens. viii. minùs
vno die.


This following I will note out of Hackney Church, that
you may see that the Clergie, were not alwaies anticipa∣ting,
and griping many liuings by this worthy man, which
relinquished great dignities, and refused greater.


Christopherus Vrswicus Regis Henrici Septimi Elemozinae∣rius,
vir sua aetate clarus, summatibus at{que} infimatibus iux∣tà
charus. Ad exteros reges vndecies pro patria legatus. De∣canatū
Eboracensem, Archidiaconatum Richmundiae, De∣canatū
Windsoriae habitos viuens reliquit. Episcopatū Nor∣wicensem
oblatum recusauit. Magnos honores totâ vita

Plenus annorū obi

etiam testamento vetuit. Hic sepultus carnis resur∣rectionem
in aduentum Christi expectat:

Obijt anno Christi incarnati 1521. Die 23.


Martij. Anno aetatis suae 74.


This testamentarie Epitaph I haue read in an ould Manu∣script.


Terram terra tegit, Daemon peccata resumat.


Res habeat Mundus, spiritus alta petat


The name of the defunct is as it were enigmatically ex∣pressed
in this ould epitaph.


Bis fuit hic natus, puer & bis, bis iuuenis{que}



Bis vir, bis{que} senex, bis doctor, bis{que} sacerdos,


In the Cathedrall church of S. 
Pauls
 in London, a stone is
inscribed thus without name.


Non hominem aspiciam
vltra.
OBLIVIO.


This man yet would not willingly haue bene forgot∣ten,
when he adioyned his Armes to continue his memo∣rye,
not vnlike to Philosophers which prefixde their
names before their Treatises of contemning glorie.


Another likewise suppressing his name, for his Epitaph
did set downe this goodly admonition.


Looke man before thee how thy death hasteth,


Looke man behind thee, how thy life wasteth:


Looke on thy right side how death thee desireth.


Looke on thy left side how sinne thee beguileth:


Looke man aboue thee, ioyes that euer shall last.


Looke man beneth thee, the paines without rest.


The Abott of S. 
Albanes
 which lieth buried there in the
high Quire, suppressed his name as modestly as any other,
in this.


Hic quidam terra tegitur


Peccato soluens debitum,


Cuius nomen non impositum,


In libro vitae sit inscriptum:


In the Cloister on the north side of S. 
Pauls
 now ruina∣ted,
one had this inscription vpon his Graue, without
name.


ƲIXI, PECCAVI, PAENITƲI,
NATVRAE CESSI.


Which is as Christian, as that was prophane of the Ro∣mane:


AMICI,
DVM VIVIMVS
V
VAMVS.


Queene 
Iane
 who died in Child birth of King 
Edward



the sixt and vsed for her deuice a 
Phaenix,
 has this there∣vnto alluding for her Epitaph.

Phenix Iana iacet, nato Phaenice, doendum


Secula Phaenices nulla tulisse duos:


The noble 
Thomas
 Earle of 
Surrey,
 father to 
Thomas
 late Duke of 
Norfolk,
 and the right honourable and nobly learned now Earle of 
Northampton,
 in the time of King 
Henry
 the eight, first refined our homly English Poesy; among many other, made this Epitaph compa∣rable with the best, for 
Thomas Clere
 Esquire his friend and follower buried at Lambeth .1545.

Norfolk sprang thee, Lambeth holds thee dead,


Clere of the County of Cleremont though high.


Within the wombe of Ormondes race thou bread


And sawest thy cosin crowned in thy sight;


Shelton for loue, Surrey for Lord thou chase,


Aye me, while life did last that league was tender:


Tracing whose steps thou sawest Kelsall blaze,


Laundersey burnt, & battered Bullen render,


At Muttrell gates hopeles of all recure


Thine Earle halfe dead gaue in thy hand his will:


Which cause did thee this pining death procure,


Ere summers seauen times seaven, thou couldest fulfill.


Ah, Clere, if loue had booted, care, or cost;


Heauen had not wonn, nor earth so timely lost.


The Duke of 
Suffolke
 and his brother, sonnes of 
Charles Brandon,
 which died of the sweat at 
Bugden,
 were buried together with this.

Vna fides viuos coniunxit, religio vna,


Ardor et in studijs vnus, et vnus amor.


Abstulit hos simul vna dies: duo corpora iungit


Vna vrna, ac mentes vnus Olympus habet.


The Earle of Deuonshire 
Edward Courtney
 honorably descended, from one of the daughters of King 
Edward
 the fourth, is buried at Saint 
Anthonies
 in 
Padua
 with this


which I set downe more for his honor, then the elegancy of the verse.

Anglia quem, genuit, fuerat{que} habitura patronum,


Corteneum celsa haec continet ar
a Ducem:


Credita causa necis, regni affectata cupido,


Reginae optatum tunc quo{que} connubium—


Cui regni proceres nou cosensere, Philippo


Reginam Regi iungere posse rati,


Europam vnde fuit iuuem peragrare necesse:


Ex quo mors misero contigit ante diem.


Anglia si plorat defuncto principe tanto,


Nil mirum, Domino deficit illa pio.


Sed iam Corteneus caelo fruitur{que} beatis


Cum doleant Angli, cum sine fine gemant:


Cortenei probitas igitur, praestantia, nomen,


Dum stabit hoc templum, viuanda semper erunt.


Anglia{que} hinc etiam stabit, stabunt{que} Britanni,


Coniugij optati fama perennis eris.


Improba naturae leges Libitina rescindens,


Ex aequo iuuenes praecipitat{que} senes.


Walter Milles,
 who died for the profession of his faith, as some saye made this Epitaph for himselfe.

Non praua impietas, aut actae crimina vitae


Armarunt hostes in mea fata truces.


Sola fides Christi sacris signata libellis,


Quae vitae causa est, est mihi causa necis.


This man was not so godly, as he was impious (as it seemeth▪) who was buried in the night without any ceremony vnder the name of 
Menalcas,
 with this.

Here lyeth Menalcas as dead as a logge▪


That liued like a deuill & died like a dogge:


Here doth he lye said I? then saye I lye,


For from this place, he parted by and by.


But here he made his discent into hell,


Without either booke, candell, or bell.



This may seeme too sharpe, but happily it proceeded from
some exulcerated minde, as that of 
Don Petro
 of 
Toledo

Viceroy of 
Naples,
 wickedly detorted out of the Scrip∣tures.

Hic est.


Qui propter nos & nostram salutem, descendit ad inferos:


A merry and wealthy Goldsmith of London in his life
time prepared this for his Grauestone, which is seene at

S. Leonards
 neere Foster-lane.


When the Bells, be merrilie runge,


And the Masse deuoutly songe,


And the meate merrily eaten:


Then is 
Robert Traps,
 his wife and children quite forgetten,


Wherefore Ihesu that of 
Mary
 sprong,


Set their soules the Saints among;


Though it be vndeserued on their side,


Let them euermore thy mercy abide,


Doctor 
Caius
 a learned Phisition of Cambridge, and a co∣founder
of 
Gunwell
 and 
Caius
 colledge, hath onely on his
monument there:

FVI CAIVS.


Which is as good as that great learned man of his professi∣on

Iulius Scaliger.


SCALIGERI QVOD RELIQVVM.


But that which Cardinall 
Pole
 appointed for himselfe, is
better than both.

Depositum Poli Cardinalis.


This ensuing for Sir 
N. Bacon
 Lord Keeper of the great
Seale, is worthy to be read, both for the honour of the per∣son
who was a most wise Councellour, and the rarenesse of

Iambi{que}
 verses in Epitaphes (albeit this our age doth de∣light

) But as he saith, 
Malos Iambus enecat, beat
bonos.




Hic Nicolaum n
 Baconum conditum


Existima illum, tam diu Britannici,


Regni secundum columen; exitium malis.








Bonis asylum, caeca quem non extulit,


Ad hunc honorem sors; sed aequitas, fides,


Doctrina, pietas, vnica, & prudentia,






Non morte raptum crede, qui vnica


Vita perennes emerit duas: agit


Vitam secundam caelites inter animos.






Fama implet orbem, vita quae illi tertia est.


Hac positum in arca est corpus, olim animi domus:


Ara dicata sempiternae memoriae.




W. Lambe,
 a man which deserued well of the citie of Lon∣don
by diuerse charitable deeds, framed this for himselfe.


As I was so be yee,


As I am yee shall be:


That I gaue, that I haue,


That I spent, that I had:


Thus I end all my cost,


That I left, that I lost.


All which 
Claudius Secundus
 a Romane contained in these
foure words:

HIC MECVM HABEO OMNIA.


Shorte and yet a sufficient commendation of M. 
Sandes

was this.


Margareta Sandes.


Digna haec luce diuturniore,


Nisi quod luce meliore digna.


And answerable thereunto is this, for a Gentleman of the
same name.


Who would liue in others breath?


Fame deceaues the dead mans trust:


When our names do change by death:


Sands
 I was, and now am dust.


Sir 
Philip Sidney
 (to whose honour I will say no more,)
but that which 
Maro
 saide of 
Marcellus
 nephew of 
Au∣gustus.
Ostendunt terris hunc tantum fata, nec vltra esse si∣nunt,

which also was answered by the Oracle to 
Claudius



the 2. Emperour of his brother 
Quintilius
) hath this most
happily imitated out of the French of 
Mons. Boniuet,

made by 
Ioach. du Bellay,
 as it was noted by Sir 
George Buc

in his 
Poetica.




England, Netherland, the heauens, and the arts,


The souldiers, and the world hath made six parts,


Of noble 
Sidney,
 for who will suppose,


That a small heape of stones, can 
Sidney
 enclose.






England had his body for she it fed,


Netherland his bloud in her defence shed:


The heauens haue his soule, the arts haue his fame,


The souldiers the griefe, the world his good name.




Vpon the golden Lion rampaut in 
Gueles
 of the house
of 
Albenye
 which the late Earle 
H. Fitz-Alan
 bare in his
armes as receauing the Earledome of 
Arundel
 from the
house of 
Albenye,
 one composed this Epitaph.


Aureus ille leo (reliqui trepidate leones)


Non in sanguineo nunc stat vt ante solo:


Nam leo de Iuda vicit, victo{que} pepercit,


Et secum patris duxit ad vs{que} domos.


Sic cadit vt surgat, sic victus vincit, et illum,


Quem modo terra tulit, nunc Paradisus habet.


In the Cloyster of 
New Colledge
 in 
Oxford,
 this following
is written with a coale, for one 
Woodgate
 who bequeathed
200 pound to one, who would not bestowe a plate for his
memoriall:


H
us Peripatetice,


Conde tibi tumulum, nec fide haeredis amori:


Epitaphium{que} compara,


Mortuus est, nec emit libris haec verba ducentis.


WOODGATVS HIC SEPVLTVS EST.


Therefore the counsaile of 
Diego de Valles
 is good, who
made his owne tombe at 
Rome
 with this inscription.


Certa dies nulli est, mors certa, incerta sequentum


Cura, locet tumulum qui sapit, ante sibi.



A Gentleman falling off his horse brake his necke, which
soddaine hap gaue occasion of much speech of his former
life, and some in this iudging world, iudged the worst. In
which respect a good friend made this good Epitaph, re∣membring
of 
S. Augustin. Miserecordia Domini inter pon∣tem,
& fontem.


My friend iudge not me,


Thou seest I iudge not thee:


Betwixt the stirrop and the ground,


Mercy I askt, mercy I found.


To the honour of Sir 
Henry Goodyer
 of 
Polesworth,
 a knight
memorable for his vertues: an affectionate friend of his,
framed this 
Tetrastich.


An yll yeare of a 
Goodyer
 v
 
rest,


Who gon to God, much lacke of him heere left:


Full of good gifts, of body and of minde,


Wise, comely, learned, eloquent, and kinde.


Short and sufficient is this of a most worthy Knight, who
for his Epitaph hath a whole College in Cambridge, and
commaunded no more to be inscribed than this.


Virtute non vi.


Mors mihi lucrum.


Hic iacet Gualterus Mildmay Miles, et vxor eius.


Ipse obijt vltimo die Maij 1589.


Ipsa decimo sexto Martij 1576.


Reliquerunt duos filios et tres filias


Fundauit Collegium Emanuelis Cantabrigiae.


Moritur Cancellarius & subthesaurarius Scaccarij, et


Regiae Maiestati â consilijs.


Vpon a youngman of great hope, a student in 
Oxford
 w
a
made this.


Short was thy life,


yet liuest thou euer:


Death hath his due,


yet diest thou neuer.



But I feare now I haue ouercharged the Readers minde,
with dolefull, dumpish, and vncomfortable lines. I will
therefore for his recomfort, end this part with a few con∣ceited,
merry, and laughing Epitaphes, the most of them
composed by maister 
Iohn Hostines
 when he was young,
and will begin with the Bellowes maker of 
Oxford.


Here lyeth 
Iohn Cruker
 a maker of Bellowes,


His craftes-master and King of good-fellowes;


Yet when he came to the hower of his death,


He that made Bellowes, could not make breath.


Thomas Elderton,
 who did arme himselfe with Ale (as ould
Father 
Ennius
 did with Wine) when he ballated, had this,
in that respect made to his memorie.


Hic situs est sitiens at{que} ebrius Eldertonus,


Quid dico hic situs est? hic potiùs sitis est.


Of him also was made this.


Here is 
Elderton
 lyeng in dust.


Or lyeng 
Elderton,
 chose which you lust.


Here he lyes dead, I doe him no wrong,


For who knew him standing, all his life long.


Some wise man was he, and so reputed for whom this was
composed.


Here lyeth Thom Nicks bodie


Who liued a foole and dyed a nodye:


As for his soule aske them that can tell.


Whether fooles soules go to heauen or to hell.


Neither may this offend any, for that of 
Durandus
 the ould
priest is little better.


Hic est Durandus positue sub marmore duro,


An sit saluandus ego nescio, nec ego curo.


Miserable was 
Hermon,
 who when he had onely drea∣med
that he had disbursed money, dyed for woe, likewise



Ph
idon
 who weapt not for that he should dye, but that
his buriall would stand 
 at 4. s. But most miserable was
that pinchpenie 
Hermocrates,
 that in his last will and testa∣ment
made himselfe his owne sole heire and executor
of all he had, and yet refused to liue when he might, be∣cause
he would not be at charge of a purgation. And our
countriman ould 
Sparges
 
ight seeme to be of his tribe,
for whom was made.


Here lyeth father Sparges


That died to saue charges.


Maister Wills doctor of Phisick who died lately at 
Vienna

would often say that he would haue this verse only for his
Epitaph.


Here lyeth willing Wills.


But a friend of his that knew him to be Caprichious, wish∣ed
him to adde one verse more to make vp time after the
manner, but when he said, he had nothing he might adde
more, one extempore sayed it might be wel made vp thus.


Here lyeth willing Wills


With his head full of Windmills.


For one that had continuall new encounters in his owne
minde, and crammed his head with contrary discontents, I
haue heard this.


Here lyeth he,


Which with himselfe could neuer agree.


You shall haue this out of the Cathedrall Church of 
Nor∣wich

whatsoeuer you account of it.


Vnder this stone


Lies Iohn Knapton.


Who died iust


The xxviii of August


M.D.XC. and one


Of this church Peti-Canon,



Vpon merry 
Tarlton,
 I haue heard this.




Hic situs est cuius vox, vultus, actio possit


Ex Heraclito reddere Democritum.






Here lyeth
 Richard a Preene,


One thousand, fiue hundred, eighty nine,


Of March the 22. day,


And he that will die after him may.






Here lieth he, who was borne and cried,


Told 
hreescore yeares, fell sick, and died.






Here lyes the man whose horse did gaine,


The Bell in race on Salsbury plaine:


Reader, I know not whether needs it,


You or your horse rather to read it.






Here lyes the man that madly slaine,


In earnest madnesse did complaine,


On nature that she did not giue,


One life to loose, another to liue.








Here lyeth C. vnder ground,


As wise as L. thousand pound.


He neuer refused the Wine of his friend,


Drinke was his life, and drinke was his end.






Here lyeth N. a man of fame


The first of his howse and last of his name.




At 
Fa

Naworth
 Castle.


Iohn Bell 
broken-brow


Ligs vnder this stean:


Four
 of myne een sonnes


Laid it on my weam.


I was a man of my meate


Master of my wife


I liued on myn own land


Without micle strife.


For old 
Th. Churchyard
 the poore Court-Poet this is now
commonly current.


Come Alecto and lend me thy torch,


To finde a Church-yard in the Church-porch.


Pouerty, and Poetry this tombe doth enclose,


Therfore Gentlemen be mery in Prose.


With this memoriales of the dead which giue a little li∣uing
breath to the dead: for as he saith, 
Mortuorum vita
in memoria vi
orum posita est,
 I conclude:


Et veniam pro laude peto: laudatus abundè:


Non fastiditus si tibi Lector ero.






FINIS.
