¶To the right worshipfull M
r
. Edvvard Dyar Esquire, 
Iohn Frampton
 wisheth pro∣sperous health and felicitie.


H
AVING lying by mee in my chamber (righte Wor∣shipful) a translation of the great voiage & lōg trauels of 
Paulus Venetus
 the 
Vene∣tian,
 manye Merchauntes, Pilots, and Marriners, and others of dyuers degrees, much bent to Discoueries, resorting to me vpon seue∣rall occasions, toke so great delight with the reading of my Booke, finding in the same such strange things, & such a world of varietie of matters, that I coulde neuer bee in quiet, for one or for an other, for the committing the same to printe in the Englishe tongue, perswading, that it mighte giue greate lighte to our Seamen, if euer this nation chaunced to find a passage out of the frozen Zone to the South Seas, and otherwise delight many home dwellers, furtherers of trauellers. But finding in my selfe small abilitie for the finishing of it, in suche perfection as the excellencie of the worke, and as this learned time did require, I stayed a long time, in hope some learned man woulde haue translat
d the worke, but finding none that would take it in hand, to satisfie so ma∣ny requests, nowe at last I determined to sette it forth, as I coulde, referring the learned in tongues, delighted in e∣loquence, to the worke it selfe, written in Latine, Spanish, and Italian, and the reste that haue but the English tong,


that seeke onelye for substaunce of matter to my playne translation, beseeching to take my trauell and good mea∣ning in the beste parte. And bethinking my selfe of some speciall Gentleman, a louer of knowledge, to whome I mighte dedicate the same, I founde no man, that I know in that respecte more worthy of the same, than your wor∣shippe, nor yet any man, to whome so many Schollers, 
 many trauellers, and so manye men of valor, suppressed or hindred with pouertie, or distressed by lacke of friends in Courte, are so muche bounde as to you, and therefore to you I dedicate the same, not bicause you your selfe wāt the knowledge of tongues, for I know you to haue the Latine, the Italian, the French, and the Spanishe: But by∣cause of youre worthinesse, and for that I haue since my firste acquaintaunce founde my selfe without any greate deserte on my parte, more bound vnto you than to anye man in 
England,
 and therefore for your desert & token of a thankefull minde, I dedicate the same to youre worship, moste humbly praying you to take it in good parte, and to bee patrone of the same: and so wishing you continu∣aunce of vertue, with muche encrease of the same, I take my leaue, wishing you with many for the cōmon wealths sake, place with aucthoritie, where you maye haue daylye exercise of the giftes that the Lorde hathe endowed you withall in plentifull sorte. From my lodging this xxvj. daye of Ianuarie. 1579.


Your vvorships to commaunde, IOHN FRAMPTON.








¶ Maister Rothorigo to the Reader.


¶ An Introduction into Cosmographie.


B
Icause many be desirous of the knowledge of the partes of the worlde, what names they haue, and in what places they be, and that many and sundry times the holy scrip∣ture doth make mention, and also it is pro∣fitable for suche as doe traffique and trade to haue know∣ledge, I was moued to giue notice to all suche as are desi∣rous or haue pleasure in reading.


You shall vnderstande, that a man turning his face to the rising of the Sunne, that parte that is before hys eies where the Sunne doth rise, is called Orient or Easte, and his contrarie where the Sunne setteth, is Occident or Weast. The course or waye of the Sunne is called 
Media die,
 or South, whiche is on youre righte hande, his contrarie parte that is on the lefte hande is called 
S
p∣tentrion
 or North.


Furthermore, you shall vnderstand, that if a manne stande in the Ilande of 
Cales,
 and looke towardes the ri∣sing of the Sunne, he shall sée thrée principall parts of the worlde▪ diuided by the Sea called 
Mediterraneum,
 that cō∣meth on
e of the greate Occean and Weaste Sea, and runneth towardes the Easte, and by two very great and principall riuers, the one comming from the South, cal∣led 
Nilus,
 and the other from the North, called 
Taenais.






Affrica


YOu shall also vnderstande, that from the entring of the straite called 
Iuberaltare,
 vppon the right hande to the riuer 
Nilus
 bordering vppon 
Egipt,
 is called 
Affrica,
 th
 Sea that is towardes vs, is called 
Libya,
 that whiche is towardes the South, is called 
Ethiopia,
 whiche is the Oc∣cean, the Sea towardes the Weaste, is called 
Atlantica,
 and is also the greate Occean Sea. It hath these famous Cities and Prouinces. Ouer againste 
Iuberaltar,
 and the coaste of 
Mallaga
 is 
Mauritania,
 whiche we call 
Barbarie.
 It is named 
Barbaria,
 bycause the people be barbarous, not onely in language, but in manners and customes. Follo∣wing towards the East is 
Numidia, Getulia, Tunes,
 a citie in 
Affrica,
 the name so giuen by 
Asu,
 to all 
Syria,
 and 
Aegipt.
 On the South parte be the 
Ethiopians,
 whiche hereafter shall be spoken of.






Europa


EVropa
 is called al y
e
 prouinces against 
Affrica
 towards the North from the greate Occean Sea, that entreth into the streits to the riuer 
Tanai,
 and the greate lake cal∣led 
Meotis,
 where this riuer entreth into. In this there is comprehēded 
Portugale, Britania, Spaine, France, Almaine, Italie, Grecia, Polonia, Hungarie,
 or 
Panonia, Valachia, Asia
 the lesser, 
Phrygia, Turkia, Galatia, Lydia, Pamphilia, Lauria, Lycia, Cilicia, Scythia
 the lower, 
Dacia, Gocia
 and 
Thrasia.








Asia


ASia
 the greater is tha
 that is beyond 
Europa
 and 
Affri∣ca,
 that is to say, on the other side o
 
Nilus
 Southward, and the riuer 
Tanais
 Northward, following the way East∣warde, and is as bigge as 
Europa
 and 
Affrica,
 and com∣passed with thrée Seas, Easterly or Orientall, 
Indico
 to the Southwarde, 
Scythia
 to the Northwarde, hauing pro∣uinces, 
Soria, Mesopotamia, Parthia, Sarmasia, Asiatica, Arabia, Persia, Armenia, Medea, Hircania, Carmania,
 the 
Indias
 on thys side and beyonde the riuer 
Ganges.


Also you shall vnderstande, that the greate Sea called the Occean, doth compasse aboute the foresaid thrée prin∣cipall partes of the worlde, and so doeth compasse all the whole worlde, althoughe there be diuers regions and pla∣ces whereas they be, hauing diuers names.


Moreouer, you shall vnderstande, that in whatsoeuer parts of the Sea that doe answere to any parts of y
e
 fore∣said Countries, as there be many Ilands inhabited with diuers people, aswel as the East parts, whereas is 
Tapro∣bane
 and 
Thyle,
 and others infinite number on theyr sides, aswel as on the other parts before declared, and those that be betwéene them and al others, are to be vnderstanded to pertain to one of these thrée parts of the world beforesaid, to whiche it may be moste properly iudged to be, and lyeth nearest vnto.






Ethiopia


MOreouer, you muste note, that 
Ethiopia
 is a common name to manye Prouinces and Countries, inhabited with blacke people called 
Negros.
 And to begin with the


moste Weaste partes, the firste is 
, that is to saye, from 
Cab
 Verde
 or the gréene Cape, and following the co
st of the Sea, to the mouth or streite of the Redde Sea. Al those prouinces be called 
Ethiopians,
 and of these 
Ethi∣opians
 from 
Ginney
 vnto 
Cas
 Mansa,
 that is to saye, the Kings pallace, they be of the sect of 
Mahomet,
 circumci∣sed the most parte of them. And the chiefest and most prin∣cipall of these people be the 
Iolofos
 and 
Mandingos,
 and be moste parte vnder the gouernement of a King called 
Mandimansa,
 for 
Mansa
 is as muche to saye as Senior or Lord, and 
Mandy Mandinga,
 so by this his title he is Lord 
Mandinga.
 This King is blacke, and his abiding is in the prouince of 
Sertano
 four hundred leagues within the land, in a Citie compassed about with a wall called 
Iaga,
 which is riche of golde and siluer, and of all suche merchaundize as is occupied in 
Adem
 and in 
Meca:
 and from thence for∣warde the 
Ethiopians
 be Idolators to the cape called 
Buo∣na Esperanca,
 and there turneth againe to the sect of 
Maho∣met.
 Beyonde these prouinces following vp into the land of 
Sartan
 bée greate and highe mountaines or hilles, cal∣led mountaines of the Moone, the toppes of them be al∣wayes couered with Snow, & at the foote of thē springeth the riuer 
Nilus,
 and this Countrie is called 
Ethiopia
 beside 
Eg
pt,
 and in 
Arabia
 it is called 
Abas,
 and the inhabitants 
h
ssm
s,
 and be Christians, and doe vse to be marked with an yron in the face: they be not baptized with fire (as some doe saye) but as we are, but they be 
Heretikes, Ia∣cobites.
 and 
Hebeyonites.
 They do holde on the olde lawe with the newe, and be circumcised, and doe kéepe the Sa∣baoth daye, and doe eate no Po
ke, and some of them doe take manye wiues, and be also baptized, and doe saye, that their King came and descended of King 
Salomon,
 and of the Quéene 
Saba,
 and this King hathe continuall warres with the 
Moores.


There is another 
Ethiopia
 called 
Asiatica interior,
 which the 
Arabians
 call 
Zenium,
 and these doe extende from the sayd hilles of the Moone,
 and of 
Nilus,
 to the borders of 
Barbarie.
 And the saying is, that among all Riuers, one∣lie 
Nilus
 entereth into two Seas, that is to saye, one braunche into the East Sea, and another braunche into the West Sea. All these 
Ethiopians
 bée 
Moores,
 and theyr laboure and occupation, is digging of golde out of the grounde, where they doe fynde great plen∣tie. There is also another 
Ethiopia
 called 
Tragodytica,
 and thys dothe reache or extende from the foresayde 
Ethiopia,
 to the streyte or mouth of the redde Sea,
 and these bée somewhat whyter, and the King and people bée 
Moores,
 and came out of 
Arabia foelix,
 for the 
Ara∣bians
 came ouer the streyte of the redde Sea, and gotte that Countrey of the 
Iacobites
 by force, and at this daye there is robbing and stealing among them secretely, for the King of the 
Iacobites
 is of so greate power, that the Souldan of 
Babilon
 doth giue him tribute.






Arabia


THat whiche wée doe call 
Arabia,
 the 
Arabians
 doe call 
Arab,
 and is called 
Gesyrdelaab.
 That whyche is betwéene the redde Sea, and 
Sinus Perficus,
 is called the Iland of 
Arabia,
 and thys is called 
Arabia Foelix,
 by reason of the Incense that groweth there.


There bée other two 
Arabias
 besyde thys, the one of them extendyng from the Mount Sinay, to the dead Sea, where the Children of 
Israell
 wente fortye yeares, and thys is called 
Arabia petrea,
 takyng that name of a Citie that is there. The other dothe ex∣tende betwéene 
Syria
 and 
Euphrates
 towardes the Ci∣tie of 
Lep
,
 and thys they doe call 
Arabia desan,



which is as muche to say, as of 
Siria,
 and our Latines doe call it 
Arabia deserta.
 And wheras the vulgar people, and men for the most part, do thinke that 
Antilla,
 or those I∣landes lately found out by commaundemente of the Ca∣tholike King 
Don Fernando,
 and Lady 
Isabell
 Quéene, be in the 
Indias,
 they be deceyued therein, to call it by the name of the 
Indias.
 And for bycause that in 
Spaniola,
 or newe 
Spayne,
 they do find gold, some doe not let to say it is 
Tharsis,
 and 
Ophin,
 and 
Sethin,
 from whence in the time of 
Salomon,
 they brought gold to 
Hierusalem.
 And thus aug∣menting erroures vpon erroures, let not to saye, that the Prophetes when they sayde that the name of oure Lorde God should be pronounced to people that haue not hearde of it, and in places and Countreys very farre off, and a∣parted, which is sayd to be vnderstanded by those that be called 
Indians,
 and by these Ilandes, and furthermore doe not let to say to this day, that it is to be vnderstanded by the places mentioned in the holy Scripture, and the Ca∣tholike doctors, and that this secret God hath kept hidden all this time, and by finding out these Ilands did reueale it. I séeing how they are deceyued in their vayne inuenti∣ons, and greate simplicitie, for zeale and good will of the truth, and to kill this canker, that it créepe no more nor ingender greater erroures, will giue light to this errour, answering to the said muttering talkers, according as to euery of them doth require.


And first you shall vnderstande, that this name 
India,
 according to all Cosmographers, as well Christians as Infidels, of old time, and of later yeares, the name dothe come of a Riuer named 
Hynde,
 or 
Hyndo,
 that going to∣wards the East, is the beginning of the 
Indias,
 whiche bée thrée in number,
 that is to say, the first is called the lower or nether 
India,
 the seconde is called the middle 
India,
 and the third is called the high or vpper 
India.
 The first or lo∣wer 
India
 is renamed 
Caysar,
 and these do extend towards


the East, from the Riuer 
India,
 vnto a Porte or Hauen on the Sea side, of great traffike and trade, called 
Cam∣baya.
 And the King of this 
India,
 and also the most part of the people be 
Moores,
 and the rest Idolaters. The second or middle 
India
 is surnamed 
Mynbar,
 and dothe reache to the borders of 
Colchico,
 and this hath very faire Hauens, and Portes of greate traffike, where they doe lade Pep∣per, Ginger, and other Spices and Drugges. The Portes or Hauens be called 
Colocud, Coulen, Hely, Faten
r, Colnugur,
 and héere be many Christians Heretikes Ne∣storians, and many 
Indians,
 although towards the North they be Idolaters. The thirde 
India,
 whiche is the hygh 
India,
 is surnamed 
Mahabar,
 and dothe extend vnto 
Cauch,
 whiche is the Riuer 
Gange.
 Héere groweth plentye of Sinamon, and Pearle. The King and people of thys Countrey worship the Oxe. Besides these thrée 
Indias,
 whiche lye towardes the rising of the Sunne, there can not be found neyther Author nor Man that hathe trauel∣led the firme land, neyther the Seas adioyning there vn∣to, that can say, there is anye other Prouince or Ilande named 
India,
 sauing that if anye woulde giue to vnder∣stand, that going towarde the West, he wente towardes the East, and that although he came vnto the terrenall Paradise, and that these Ilands shoulde lye in the greate Weast Occean Seas, it appeareth playnely, for that those that sayle thither, steame their Shippe towards the Occident, and his direct wind whiche he sayleth withall, is out of the Orient or the East. So it appeareth, that they sayle not vnto the 
India,
 but that they flye and depart from the 
India.
 And thus it appeareth that he would say, that the firste name that euer it hadde, or was sette, na∣ming it 
Antillya,
 seeming, that by the corruption of the vulgar, naming it 
Ante India,
 as to say against 
India,
 e∣uen as Antechrist is contrary or against Christ, or Ante∣north againste the North. And thus it appeareth, that it


can not be named 
India,
 but to vnderstande it as an ante∣phrase, cleane contrary, as a 
Negro,
 or a blacke 
Moore
 shoulde be named white 
Iohn,
 or a Negresse or blacke woman, to be named a Pearle, or a 
Margarita,
 that for finding gold in the Iland named 
H
spaniola,
 it should haue the name set 
Tharsia,
 or 
Ophin,
 or 
Sethin,
 nor beléeue it standeth in 
Asia
 as some woulde saye, although the thyng is so cléere, that it séemeth a mockerie to proue it: but reason dothe leade, that wée shoulde gyue Mylke vnto Children and Infantes. 
Saincte Austine
 declareth, that the circumstance of the letter dothe il∣luminate the sentence. And it appeareth in the thyrde Booke of Kings, in the tenth Chapter, and the second of Paralipomenon, in the ninth Chapter, do saye, that the Seruantes of 
Salomon,
 and of 
Diran,
 doe fynde they broughte from 
Ophin
 and 
Sethin,
 and 
Tharsis,
 not onely golde, but also Siluer and Timber, called 
Thina,
 and Elephantes téeth, and Peacocks, and Apes, and Pre∣cious stones, the whyche thyngs in infinite places of the very true 
Indians,
 as well in Countreys farre with∣in the lande, as also in Countreys vppon the Sea syde, and also in Ilandes wythout number, that bée in the Oriente or East Seas, shall be founde, as by ex∣perience of the Merchantes traffiking into the East, conforming to the holy Scripture, and to all those that doe write, as well Catholikes, as Prophanes, is many∣fest. And in the Ilande called 
Spaniola,
 there can bée found no suche Timber, nor all the other thyngs before named, sauyng Golde, the whiche as by this worke wyll appeare, is founde in a greate number of places of the Orientall partes. What is hée that in bringing gold from 
Antilla,
 will proue it is from 
Ophin,
 or 
Sethin,
 or 
Tharsis,
 from whence it was brought to 
Salomon.
 First hée must prooue that it was neuer founde but in one place, and that at thys daye it is not to bée had, but in


the same place only, from whence it was broughte to 
Sa∣lomon,
 the which is a manifest vntruth or false. And also they that vnderstande that the storie of the holy scripture, and the holy prophets, when they do now name countries from whence those things be brought, and farre Ilandes of Idolatours, wheeeas the name of God was not h
ard, did not speak but of 
Spaniola,
 and of the other West parts, he must proue there is no other Idolatours in the worlde but those whom he falsely calleth 
Indians,
 nor other Ilāds but the 
Spaniola,
 and the other West Ilandes, and thys is of a truth, all false, for 
Grecia
 is Ilandes, 
Scicilia,
 a noble I∣lande, and 
Malta,
 and 
Lipari, Yzcla, Serdenya, Corsica, Mallorca, Minorca, Ybisa, Canarias, England,
 and others infinite in the foure partes of the world, before now hath bin founde Of the whiche in the Orient or east, is 
Taprobano,
 which is the most noble Iland in the world, and the Ile which is sayde to be so happie and fortunate, that of neuer trée there fal∣leth a leafe of in the whole yeare, as also by thys Booke of 
Marcus Paulus
 is to be séene in the 
106.
 Chapter, of one Ilande that is in the Orientall seas 
.1500.
 myles, in the which there is found gold in so great abundaunce, that it is sayde the Kinges Pallace is couered or tyied wyth gold.


And furthermore, it is sayd, that the fame is, that in those seas be seauen thousand four hundred fortie eight Ilandes, in the whiche there is not founde one trée, but that is swéete, pleasaunt, and fruiteful, and of great profit, wherby we may wel conclud, that in many other Ilands, there is gold to be found: therfore it is not necessarie, that the holye Scriptures shoulde be so vnderstanded by 
An∣tilla,
 when it is sayde, they went for gold to 
Tharsis,
 & 
Ophyn,
 and 
Sechyn,
 yea and although they wyll not beléeue the 
∣ther truthes, they can not denye the saying of the holye Scripture in the Seconde Chapter of 
Genesis,
 where


it is sayde that the first riuer that goeth out of Paradise is 
hyson,
 which doth compasse the whole countrey of 
Eiu∣lath,
 where golde doth growe, and that the golde of that countrey is very good and pure, nor it was not néedefull to haue thrée yeres from Ierusalem to 
Antilla,
 as it is for the Ilands of the 
Indians,
 whiche is more further off, by a great deale, and with much more difficultnesse to prouyde the precious stones, and all other things they brought frō thence, and also the wayes be more difficulte and strange, by reason of contrarye windes, and manye other incum∣braunces. And that this was not vnderstanded that the people a farre of are these Ilandes now founde, it appea∣reth by Saint Paule in the fiftéenth Chapter to the Ro∣maynes, where is expounded the saying of Esay in the 
52.
 Chapter, wher it is sayde, That those to whom it was not pronounced vnto, shoulde sée, and those that did not heare of him, should vnderstande. And this, as a lyttle aboue is sayde, is vnderstanded, that from Ierusalem to the Iles of 
Grecia,
 to the sea 
Illyrico
 which is the end of 
Grecia,
 and the beginning of 
Italy,
 by 
Slauonia,
 or 
Dalmatia,
 and 
Venice,
 where before they had not hearde the name of Christ de∣clared. And bycause the holye ghost hath interpreted thys sentence by Saint Paul, applying that prophecie with o∣ther like of his workes, there remayneth no licence for o∣ther to apply it to 
Antilla.


But now let vs come to the summe of this reckning, and say, that if for the golde that is founde in 
Antilla,
 wée should beléeue that it is 
Tharsis,
 and 
Ophyn,
 and 
Sethyn,
 by y
e
 other things that be founde in 
Ophyn,
 &c, and not in 
Antil∣la,
 we must beléeue that it is not those, nor those it. And moreouer, it appeareth that 
Asia
 and 
Tharsis, Ophyn,
 and 
Sethyn,
 be in the East, and 
Antilla
 the 
Spanyola
 in the west, in place and condition much different.

FINIS TABVLAE.








The Prologue.


T
O all Princes, Lordes, Knightes, and all other persons that this my Booke shall sée, heare, or reade, health, prospe∣ritie, and pleasure. In thys Booke I do mind to giue knowledge of strange and maruellous things of the world, and spe∣cially of the partes of 
Armenia, Persia, India, Tartaria,
 and of many other prouinces and Countreys, whiche shall be declared in this worke, as they were séene by me 
Marcus Paulus,
 of the noble Citie of 
Venice:
 and that which I saw not, I declare by report of those that were wise, discrete, and of good credite, but that which I saw, I declare as I saw it, and that which I knew by others, I declare as I heard it. And for that this whole worke shall be faithfull and true, my intente is not to write any thing, but that which is very certaine. I do giue you all to vnderstande, that sithence the birth of our Sauioure and Lorde Iesus Christ, there hathe bin no man, Christian, nor Heathen, that hathe come to the knowledge and sight of so manye diuers, maruellous, and strange things, as I haue séene and hearde, whiche I will take in hande the laboure to write, as I did sée and heare it. For me thinke I shoulde do a great iniurie to the world, in not manifesting or de∣claring the truth. And for better information to them that shall reade or heare this worke, I do giue you to vn∣derstand, that I trauelled in the foresayd Prouinces and Countreys, and did sée those things that I will declare, y
e
 space of sixe and twentie yeares, & caused thē to be writ∣ten to Mayster 
Vstacheo
 of 
Pisa,
 the yeare of our Lorde God 
.1298.
 He and I then being prisoners in 
Ianua,
 raig∣ning in 
Constantinople
 the Emperoure 
Baldouino,
 and in his time in the yeare of oure Lord 
.1250.
 
Nicholas
 my fa∣ther, and 
Mapheo
 my vncle his brother, Citizens of 
Ve∣nice,



went to 
Constantinople
 with their Merchandises. And béeyng there a certayne tyme, wyth councell of theyr friendes, passed wyth such wares and iewels as they had boughte in the Countrey of the Souldan, where they were a long time, determining to goe forwarde, and tra∣uelling a long iourney, came to a Citie of the Lorde of the 
Tartarians,
 which is called 
Barcacan,
 who was Lord of a greate parte of 
Tartaria, 
urgaria,
 and 
Asia.
 And this Lord 
Barcacan,
 tooke greate pleasure to sée my father 
Ni∣cholas
 and my Vncle 
Mapheo,
 and shewed them greate friendship, and they presented to hym such iewels as they broughte with them from 
C
nstantinople,
 who receyued them thankefully, and gaue them giftes double the va∣lew, whiche they sent into dyuers partes to sell, and they remayned in his Courte the space of one yeare, in which tyme warres beganne betwéene the sayde 
Barcacan
 and 
Alan,
 Lord of the 
Tartares
 of the East, and there was be∣twéene them many great battayles, and muche shedding of bloud, but in the end, the victorie fell to 
Alan.
 And by∣cause of these warres, my father and vncle coulde not re∣turne the way they went, but determined to go forwarde to the Eastward, and so to haue returned to 
Constantinople,
 and following their way, came to a Citie in the East partes, called 
Buccata,
 whiche is within the precinct of the East Kingdome. And departing from this Citie, pas∣sed the Riuer which is called 
Tygris,
 whiche is one of the foure that commeth out of Paradise terrenall, and goyng seauentéene dayes iourneys through a Deserte, not fin∣ding any
 Citie or Towne, yet méeting with manye companyes of 
Tartares,
 that went in the fields with their Cattel: béeing past thys Desert, they came to a great & noble Citie called 
Bocora,
 and the same name hadde that Prouince, which the Kyng of that Countrey had, and the Citie was called 
Barache,
 and this is the greatest Citie in 
Persia.
 In thys Countrey, were these two bréethren


thr
e yeares. And in this time came an Embassadoure from 
Hamil
 Lorde of the Easte, whiche wente to the greate 
Alan
 Lorde of the 
Tartares,
 that before was spoken of. This 
Alan
 is otherwise called the greate 
Cane.
 Thys Embassadoure maruelled muche to sée these two Brée∣thren béeyng Christians, and tooke greate pleasure at them, bycause they hadde neuer before that tyme séene any Christians, and sayde to them, Friends, if you wyll followe or take my councell, I will shewe you wayes or meanes whereby you shall gette greate riches and re∣nowme. Oure Lorde the King of the 
T
rtares,
 didde neuer sée anye Christians, and hathe great desire to sée of them, if you will goe with me, I will bring you to his presence, where you shall 
aue greate profite and friendshippe of hym.


They hearing thys, determined to goe with hym, and trauelling the space of one yeare towardes the East Southeast, and after turning to the lefte hande towards the Northeast, and after towardes the North, in fine, they came to the Citie of the great 
Cane,
 in the whyche trauell they sawe manye straunge and 
aruellous things, whyche shall be declared in thys B
ke. And these two bréethren, béeyng presented to the great 
Cane,
 were receyued by him very fauourably, shewing to them greate friendshippe, demaundyng of them of the Empe∣roure of the Christians, of hys state, and howe hée ru∣led and gouerned hys Countreys, and kepte them in peace and iustice. And when hée made anye warres, howe and after what manner hée brough
e hys people into the fielde, andeh demaunded of them the state and order of other Kyngdomes and Dukedomes in Chry∣stendome, or theyr conditions, and afterwarde wyth greate diligence, hée en
uyred of them of the 
Pope
 and the Cardinalles, and of theyr fayth,


and of the Catholike Church, and of all other conditions of the Christians, to the which demaundes the two brée∣thren aunswered in order very discretely and wisely, who hadde vnderstanding, and could speake the 
Tartarie
 lan∣guage. The great 
Cane
 vnderstandyng theyr answeres, had grat pleasure therein, and speaking to his Lords, say∣ing, that hée woulde sende an Embassadour to the Pope, the head Bishop of the Christians, and requested the said two bréethren, that it woulde please them to be his Em∣bassadors to the Pope, with one of his Lordes: they aun∣swered, they were readie to doe all that he woulde com∣maund them. Streight way the great 
Cane
 caused to bée written Letters of beliefe in the 
Tartarian
 tong to the Pope, and also commaunded by worde of mouth to hys sayd Embassadors, that they shoulde saye, and desire hys holynesse, that it would please him to send him a hundred men, discrete, wise, and learned Christians in the Catho∣like faith, to instruct him and his Subiects, whereas then they did all worship Idols, and would gladly receyue the true faith. And also, the great 
Cane
 requested them to bring him some of the Oyle that did burne before the Sepulchre of Iesus Christe in 
Ierusalem.
 This done, the great 
Cane
 commaunded to be broughte to him a Table of gold, and wrote in it, commaunding expresly to all hys subiects that shoulde sée that his Table, that they shoulde receyue those Embassadors with all frendshippe, and to shew them honour and obedience, and to do al things that shoulde be necessarie, and to deliuer them money, and to prouide them what they woulde demaunde, as well for shipping, as also Horses, or any other thing, in as ample maner, as if it were for his owne person. When the sayd 
Nicholas
 and 
Mapheo,
 and 
Cocoball,
 Embassador to the great 
Cane,
 were at a poynt to depart, taking their leaue of y
e
 great 
Cane,
 they rode with their cōpany thirtie days iourney, and at the ende of them, the saide 
Cocoball
 fell


sicke and dyed, and the two bréethren followed on theyr iourney, and in euery Towne where they came shewing the foresayd Table of gold, where very honourably recey∣ued and enterteyned, as the person of the King. And con∣tinuing their iourney, they came to a towne called 
Giaza,
 and from thence departed, and came to 
Acre
 in the mo∣neth of Aprill,
 in the yeare of our Lord God 
.1272.
 where∣as they vnderstoode that the Pope 
Clement
 was dead, and finding there a Legate of the Popes, which was cal∣led 
Miser Thebaldo,
 that was there for the defence of the holy Church, at the vttermost partes of the Seas, to him they did theyr Embassage of the greate 
Cane,
 and when 
Miser Thebaldo
 vnderstoode their Embassage, he prayed them to tarrie the creation of a newe Pope, and hearing this aunswere, the two bréethren departed incontinente, and went to 
Nigro Ponte,
 and from thence to 
Venice,
 to sée their houses, and founde the wife of 
Nicholas
 dead, and had left behinde hir a sonne, whose name was 
Marcus,
 of the age of fiftéene yeares, which neuer saw his father be∣fore, for he left hir with child of him at his departing, and this is the same 
Marcus
 that made thys Booke, as héere∣after followeth. These two bréethren remayned in 
Ve∣nice
 the space of two yeares, tarying the creation of a newe Pope, and séeyng howe long they had taryed, de∣parted from 
Venice
 to 
Ierusalem,
 for to gette some of the Oyle that burned in the Lampe before the holy Sepul∣
hre of oure Lorde God, for to carrie with them to the greate 
Cane,
 according as he commaunded, and caryed with them 
Marcus,
 sonne to the saide 
Nicholas,
 and after they had taken of the sayd oyle, returned to 
Acre,
 where∣as the Popes Legate 
Theobaldo
 was, and taking leaue or licence of him to returne to the great 
Cane,
 for whome the sayde Legate gaue them Letters, séeing they woulde not tarrie to do their Embassage to the Pope, and sayde, as soone as there was a new Pope created, he would doe


their Embassage to the Pope, and that he should prouide that which should be conuenient, and so departed the two bréethren, and 
Marcus,
 and trauelled till they came to a Towne called 
Giaza.
 And in this time the Legate recey∣ued Letters from 
Rome,
 that there was a new Pope crea∣ted, called 
Gregorie
 of 
Placentia.
 The sayd Legate incon∣tinent sent his messenger after these two bréethren, that they should returne to 
Acre,
 certifying thē, y
t
 there was a new Pope created: and they vnderstanding this, re∣quested the King of 
Armenia
 to commaunde to arme forthe a Galley, wherein they sayled incontinente to the Pope, of whome they were well receyued, who hauyng hearde their Embassage, streighte way gaue them two Friers, of the order of 
Sainct Dominike,
 being greate Clearkes, to go with them to the greate 
Cane,
 the one of them was called Frier 
Nicholas
 of 
Venice,
 and the other Frier 
William
 of 
Tripolle,
 the whiche were well séene and exercised in disputations in the defense of the holy Ca∣tholike faith. And these two religious men with 
Nicholas
 and 
Mapheo,
 and 
Marcus,
 trauelled, till they came to a Towne called 
Giaza.
 And in this time the Souldan of 
Babylon
 came into 
Armenia,
 and did there greate hurte, and for that cause, fearing to passe anye further, the two Friers taryed there, and wrote to the greate 
Cane,
 that they were come thyther, and the cause wherefore, they wente not forwarde. The sayd 
Nicholas
 and 
Maph
,
 and 
Marcus
 hys sonne wente on theyr iourney, and came to a Citie called 
Bemoniphe,
 where the great 
Cane
 was, but in the way they passed in greate daunger of their bo∣dyes, and saw many things, as shall héereafter be decla∣red, and taryed in going betwéene 
Giaza
 and 
Bomeniphe.
 
 yeare and a halfe, by reason of great Riuers, rayne, and cold in those countryes: and when the greate 
Cane
 hadde knowledge that 
Nicholas
 and 
Mapheo
 were returned, he sent to receyue them, more than fortie dayes iourney, and


at their comming receyued them with gret pleasure, an∣they knéelyng down, making great reuerence, he commaūd¦ded them to arise vp, demaūding of them how they spedde in their voyage, and what they had done with the Pope, and after they had made their answeare to al things, deli∣uered to him the Friers letters that remayned in 
Giaza,
 and the oyle they had taken out of the Lampe that burned before the holy Sepulchre of Iesus Christe, whiche he re∣ceyued with great pleasure, and put it vp, and kept it in a secrete place, with also the letters, and demaunding of them, who 
Marcus
 was, they aunswered, he was 
Ni∣cholas
 sonne, of the which the great 
Cane
 was glad, and toke him into his seruice, and gaue order to place him in his Court among his Lordes and Gentlemen.




Here foloweth the dis∣course of many notable and strange things, that the noble and vvorthy 
Marcus Paulus
 of the Citie of 
Venice
 did see in the East partes of the world.














¶ Howe 
Miser Marco Polo
 vsed himselfe in the Court of the Great Cane. CHAP. 1.


M
Arco Polo
 learned well not onely the vsed language and conditions of those people, but also other thrée languages, and coulde write and reade them, and by that meanes came in great fauour with the great Cane, whose pleasure was to proue what he could do, to be sent Embassage,
 and made hym 
is Embassadour in one of his Countreys, sixe Monethes 
ourney. And he perceyuing the great Cane had greate plea∣
ure to heare newes, and oftentimes would find fault with his Embassadoures and messengers, when they coulde not make 
iscourse, and tell him newes of the Countreys and places 
hey trauelled into, he determined with himselfe to note and 
nderstand in that iourney all that could be spoken, as well of 
he Townes, Cities, and places, as also the conditions and 
ualities of the people, noting it in writing, to be the more 
eadie to make his aunswere, if any thing should be demaun∣
ed of him: and at his returne declared to the great Cane the 
unswere of the people of that Countrey to his Embassage: 
nd withall declared vnto hym the nature of Countreys, 
nd the conditions of the people where he had bin, and also 
hat he had heard of other Countreys, which pleased well the 
reat Cane, and was in great fauoure with him, and set great 
ore by him, for which cause, all the noble men of his Courte 
ad him in great estimation, calling him 
Senior
 or Lorde. He 
as in the greate Canes Court .xvij. yeares,
 and when anye 
reate Embassage or businesse shoulde be done in any of hys Countreys or Prouinces, he was alwayes sente, wherefore, 
iuers great men of the Court did enuie him, but he alwayes


kepte thys order, that whatsoeuer he sawe or heard, were 
 good or euill, hée alwayes wrote it, and had it in minde to de∣clare to the great Cane in order.

 his firste Wi
. The names of these Embassadors were called 
Onlora, A∣pusca,
 and 
Edilla.
 When these Embassadors arriued at th
 Courte, they were very well receyued by the Great Ca
▪ And after they hadde done theyr message, the Greate Ca
 caused to bée called before him a Mayden, whiche was called 
Cozotine,
 of the kindred of 
Balgonia,
 the whyche was very
 fayre, and of the age of seauentéene yeares. And as she was come before the Great Cane, and the Embassadors, the great Cane sayde to the Embassadors, thys is the Mayden that you demaunde, take hyr, and carrie hir in a good houre: an
 wyth thys the Embassadors were very ioyfull and merrie. And these Embassadors vnderstandyng of 
Nicholas
 and 
Ma∣pheo,
 and 
Marcus Paulus, Italians,
 which before that tyme ha




one for Embassadors vnto the 
Indians,
 and were desirous to 
epart from the greate Cane, desired hym to gyue them li∣
ence to goe, and accompanye that Lady: and the Greate 
ane, although not wyth good will, but for manners sake, and 
lso for honour of the Ladye, and for hyr more safegarde, in 
assing the Seas, bycause they were wise and skilfull menne, 
as content they should goe.






Hovv they sayled to Iaua. CHAP. 3.


H
Auing licence of the Great Cane, the sayde 
Nicholas
 & 
Mapheo,
 and 
Marcus Paulus,
 as aforesayde, as his custome was, gaue them two Tables of golde, by the whiche he did signifie that they should passe fréelie through all his pro∣uinces and dominions, and that theyr charges should be borne, and to be ho∣
ourably accompanyed. And besides this, the great Cane sent 
iuers Embassadors to the 
Pope,
 and to the Frenche King, 
nd to the King of 
Spayne
; and to many other Prouinces in Christendome, and caused to be armed and sette forth foure∣
éene great Shippes, that euery one of them had four Mastes.
 To declare the reason wherefore he did this, it were too long, 
herefore I let it passe. In euery Shippe he put sixe hundreth men, and prouision for two yeares. In these Shippes wente 
he sayd Embassadors, with the Lady and 
Nicholas,
 and 
Ma∣
heo
 bréethrē, and 
Marcus Paulus
 aforesayd, and sayled thrée Monethes continually, and then arriued at an Ilande called 
aua,
 being in the South partes, in the which they found mar∣
ellous and strange things, as héereafter shall be declared. And departing from this Iland, sayling on the 
Indian
 Seas 
viij. Moneths before they came to the place they would come to, founde (by the w
y) many maruellous and strange things, 
s héereafter shall be declared.








Hovv Nicholas and Mapheo, and Marco Polo returned to 
Venice,
 after they had seene and heard many mar∣uellous thinges. CHAP. 4.


A
Fter their arriuall with this foresayde Lady to the Kingdome they went vnto, they found that the King 
Argon
 was dead, and for that cause, married that mayde to his sonne: and there did gouerne in the roome of the Kyng, a Lorde, whose name was 
Archator,
 for by∣cause the King was very yong. And to this Gouernoure or Viceroy, was the Embassage declared, and of him the two Bréethren and 
Marco Polo
 demaunded licence to goe into their Countrey, whiche he graunted, and withall gaue them foure Tables of gold, two of them were to haue Ierfawcons, and other Hawkes with them. The thirde was, to haue Ly∣ons. And the fourth was, that they shoulde goe frée, withoute paying any charges, and to be accompanyed and enterteyned as to the Kings owne person. And by this commaundement, they had company and gard of two hundreth Knightes from Towne to Towne, for feare of manye Théeues vppon the wayes: and so much they traueiled, that they came to 
Trape∣sonsia,
 and from thence to 
Constantinople,
 and so to 
Nigro Ponte,
 and 
al
ie, to 
Venice,
 in the yeare of oure Lord God .1295.


This we doe declare, for that all men shall knowe, that 
Nicholas
 and 
Mapheo
 bréethren, and 
Marco Polo,
 haue seene, hearde, and did knowe the maruellous things written in this Booke, the which declaring in the name of the Father, and the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, shall be declared as héere∣after followeth.








Of Armenia he lesser, and of many things that there is made. CHAP. 5.


F
Irst and formost, I will beginne to declare of the Prouince of 
Armenia,
 noting suche com∣modities as there is. You shall vnderstand, there be two 
Armenias,
 the greater, and the lesser. In the lesser, there is a King subiect to the 
Tartar,
 and he dothe maynteyne the Coun∣trey in peace and iustice. In this Countrey be many Cities and Townes, and greate abundance of all things. In thys Countrey they take great pleasure and pastime in Hawking and Hunting, as well of wilde beastes,
 as of Fowles of all sortes. In that Countrey be many infirmities, by reason the ayre is yll there, and for that cause, the men of that Coun∣trey, that were wonte to be valiant and strong in armes, bée turned nowe to be vile, and giuen to ydlenesse and druncken∣nesse. In this Prouince vpon the Sea side, there is a Citie called 
Gloza,
 wherevnto is greate trade of Merchandise, and all Merchantes that doe traffique thither,
 haue their Cellers and Warehouses in that Citie, as well 
Venetians,
 and 
Iano∣ueys,
 and all other that do occupye into 
Leuant.






Of the Torchomanos in Armenia the lesser. CHAP. 6.


I
 Haue declared vnto you of 
Armenia
 the lesser, and now I will shewe you of 
Torchomania,
 whiche is a part of 
Armenia,
 in the which ther be thrée maner of people, the one called 
Torchomanos,
 and those bée 
Mahomets,
 and speake the 
Persian
 language, and they liue in the Mountaynes and fieldes, whereas they may


find pasture for their Cattell, for those people liue by y
e
 gaines of their Cattell.
 There be very good Horses called 
Torchoma∣ni,
 and good Mayles of great value. The other, or second ma∣ner of people be 
Armenians
 and 
Greekes,
 and those dwell and liue togither, and liue by occupations and trade of Merchan∣dises. There they doe make very goodly and rich Carpettes, large and fayre, as you shall finde in any place. Also, they worke there, cloth of Crymson Silke, and other goodly cou∣loures. The chiefest Cities in that Countrey be 
Chemo, Isiree,
 and 
Sebasto,
 whereas 
Saint Blase
 was martired. There be also many Townes, of which I make no mention, and they bée subiecte to the 
Tartar
 of the East, and he setteth gouernoures there.






Of Armenia the greater, and of the Arke of 
Noe.
 CHAP. 7.


A
Rmenia
 the greater is a greate Prouince or Countrey. In the beginning thereof is a greate Citie called 
Armenia,
 where they doe make excellente 
Bochachims
 or Buckrams. In this Citie be very good Bathes natural∣lye. And this Countrey is subiect to the 
Tar∣tar,
 & there is in it many Cities & Townes, and the most noble Citie is called 
Archinia,
 which hath ioyning to it two prouin∣ces, the one called 
Archeten,
 the other 
Arzire.
 In this Citie is a Bishop. The people of this Countrey in y
e
 sommer time bée in the pastures & meddowes, but in y
e
 winter they can not, by reason of y
e
 great cold, snow, & waters, for then it is so colde, y
e
 scant the cattell and beastes can liue there,
 and for this cause they do driue their cattel into warmer places, wher they haue grasse plēty. In this gret 
Armenia
 is y
e
 Arke of 
Noe
 on a high Mountain towards y
e
 South, which doth ioyne to a Prouince towardes the East called 
Mausill.
 And in that Prouince diuell


Christians, which be called 
Iacobites,
 and 
Nestorians
 Heretikes, of the which hereafter shall be spoken.
 This Countrey to∣wards the North doth ioyne vpon the 
Georgians,
 of the whych shall be spoken in the next Chapter. In this part towards the 
Georgians
 there is a well, the water wherof is like oyle, and is of great abundance & quantitie, that sometimes they lade .100. Ships with it. And this oyle is not good to eate, but for Lamps and Candles, and to annoint Camels, Horses, and other beastes that be galled, scabbie, and haue other infirmities, and for this cause it is fetched into diuers places.






Of the Georgians, and of the Tovver and gate of yron. CHAP. 8.


I
N 
Georgiania
 is a king called 
Nand Maliche,
 which is as much to say as 
Dawnid,
 and is subiect to the 
Tartar.
 The saying is that in the olde time, the Kings of that Prouince were borne with a token or signe vnder their right shoulder. In this Coun∣trey y
e
 men be faire of body, venterous & valiant in armes, and good archers, and are Christians & Gréekes mingled togither, & they go all with their heare like Priestes. This is the Pro∣uince y
t
 King 
Alexander
 could not passe,
 whē he woulde haue come towards the West parts, bycause y
t
 wayes were dange∣rous & narrow, & compassed on y
e
 one side with y
t
 Sea, & on the other side with high Mountaines, that no Horse can passe, or go for y
e
 space of four leagues, for y
e
 way is so narrow & strōg, y
t
 a few mē be able to kéepe it against al the hostes of y
e
 world. And K. 
Alexander
 perceiuing y
t
 by no meanes he coulde passe,
 would likewise make prouision, that the people of that Coun∣trey might not passe to him. And made there a greate & strong Tower, which is called the Tower and gate of yron. In this Prouince of the 
Georgians
 be many Cities and townes, & there they do make great plēty of cloth of gold, & of silke in great a∣bundance, for they haue greate plentie of silke. And there doe


bréede the goodlyest and best Hawkes in the world.
 And the Countrey is plentifull of all things néedefull. They liue there by the trade of Merchandise, and by labour of the Countrey. Through all this Countrey is greate Mountaynes, and the way narrow and strong, and many welles, and for this cause the 
Tartars
 can neuer haue the vpper hand of them. There is a Monast
rie of Monckes of the order of 
Saint Bernarde,
 and hard by the Monasterie there is a water that descendeth from the Mountayne, in the which they find no fishe, but in Lent, and then they do take it in greate plentie from the firste day of Lent, till Easter euen. The place is called 
Geluchelan,
 and hath sixe hundred Miles compasse, and it is from the Sea twelue dayes iourney, and this water entreth into 
Euphrates,
 whyche is one of the foure principall Riuers whiche come from Para∣dice terrenall, and commeth out of 
India,
 and is deuided into many branches, and doth compasse those hilles. From thence they bring a silke called 
Gella.
 Now I haue declared vnto you the partes of 
Armenia
 which be towards the North, and now I wil declare vnto you of others their neyboures which be to∣wards the South and West.






Of the parties of Armenia tovvards the South, and of the Kingdome of 
Mosull.
 CHAP. 9.


M
Osull
 is a great Kingdome, in the which dwell many generations of people called 
Arabies,
 and all be of the secte of 
Mahomet,
 although there be some Christians, called 
Iacobites,
 and 
Nestorians,
 and these haue by themselues a Patriarke, called 
Iacobia,
 and he dothe insti∣tute Bishops, Archbishops, Abbots, Priestes, and other Reli∣gious men.
 There is made cloth of gold, and of silke, which be called by the name of the Kingdome 
Mosulinus,
 and there is greate plentie and abundance of it, and also greate plentie of


spices and good cheape, and of other Merchandise. In the Mountaynes of this prouince dwell people cal
ed 
Cordos,
 and others called 
Iacobinos.
 The rest be 
Moores
 of the sect of 
Maho∣met,
 and be good men of warre, and be all rouers and robbers of Merchants.






Of Baldach, and of many goodly things that be there. CHAP. 10.


B
Aldache
 is a very great Citie,
 in the whych is resident one that is called 
Calipho,
 whiche is among y
t
 
Moores,
 as it were chiefe gouernour & head. Through the middest of the Citie run∣neth a great Riuer, and goeth into the 
Indian
 Sea. And there is from this Citie to the place where it en∣treth into the Sea. xviij. dayes iourney. From this Citie to the Sea, and from the Sea to this Citie, there dothe passe dayly by this Riuer, in many and diuers vessels, diuers kinds of Merchandise, and they haue to their neyboure the 
India.
 And in this Countrey is a Citie called 
Chisi.
 By thi
 
iuer they goe to the 
Indian
 Sea. Betwéene 
Baldach
 and 
Chisi
 vppon the Riuer is a Citie called 
Barsera,
 compassed with greate Mountaynes of Palmes and Date trées perfect good. In 
Bal∣dach
 they doe make cloth of golde of diuers sortes, and cloth of silke, called cloth of Nasich, of Chrimson, and of diu
rs other coloures and fashions. There is great plentie of foure footed Beastes, and of Fowles. This Citie is one of the best and the noblest in the worlde. There was in this Citie a 
Calipho
 of the 
Moores,
 wonderfull and maruellous rich of gold and pre∣tious stones. And in the yeare of our Lorde God .1230. the King of the 
Tartars
 called 
Alan,
 ioyned a greate company, and went and sette vpon this Citie, and toke it by force, being in the C
tie one hundred thousande Horsemen, besides infinite number of footemen. And there he founde a great Tower full


of golde, siluer, and pretious stones. And King 
Alan
 séeing this great treasure, maruelled much, and sent for the 
Calipho,
 and sayd vnto him: I do much maruell of thy auarice, that ha∣uing so great treasure, didst not giue parte of it to mainteyne valiant men, that might defend me from thée, knowing that I was thy mortall enimie. And perceyuing the 
Calipho
 knewe not how to make him an answere, said vnto him, bycause thou louest this treasure so well, I will thou shalte haue thy fill of it, and caused him to be shut fast in the same Tower, where he liued foure dayes, and died miserably for hunger, and from that time forwards the 
Moores
 woulde haue no more 
Caliphos
 in that Citie.






Of a Citie called Totis, and of other notable things. CHAP. 11.


T
Otis
 is a greate Citie of the Prouince or Countrey of 
Baldach,
 in the whiche Prouince there be manye Cities and Townes, but the most noblest is 
Totis.
 The people of thys Citie bée Merchantes, and h
ndycraftes men. There they do make cloth of golde, and of silke, very riche, and of greate value. And this Citie is sette in so good a place, that they doe bryng thyther all Merchandi∣ses of 
India,
 and of 
Baldach,
 and of 
Osmaseilli,
 and of 
Cremes,
 and of many other Cities and Countreys, and also of the Latines. There is greate plenty of pretious stones, and for that cause the Merchants gette muche. Thyther trade the 
Armenians, Iacobite
, Nestorians, Persians,
 and these in a manner bée all Ma∣homets. Rounde aboute this Citie be many fayre Gardens full of singular good frutes, although the 
Moores
 that there doe dwell be very ill people, robbers and killers.








Of a great miracle that hapned in 
Mosull.
 CHAP. 12.


I
N 
Mosull,
 a Citie in the Prouince of 
Baldach
 was a 
Calipho,
 a great enimie of the Christi∣ans, whose studie daye and night was how he might destroy them, and to make them forsake their faith in Iesus Christ, and vpon this, ioy∣ned in councell diuers times with hys wise men, and in the ende one of them said, I will tell you a way how you shal haue good cause to kill, or force them to renounce their Faith. Iesus Christ sayth in hys Gospell, 
If you haue so much Faith as the grayne of Mustard seede, and saye to thys Mountayne passe from this place to another place, it woulde do,
 therefore cause to be called togither all the Christians, and commaund them by their beléefe, that such a hill doe passe from that place to suche a place: truly it is not possible for them to doe it, and not doing it, you may iustly saye to them, that eyther theyr Gospell dothe not saye truth, and by that meanes they follow lyes, or else they haue not so much Fayth as a grayne of Mustarde séede. And thus as well for the one, as for the other, you maye iustly putte them to death, or else force them to forsake theyr Fayth they holde. This coun∣cell pleased well the 
Calipho,
 and those of hys sect, beléeuing, that nowe they hadde good occasion to performe their euill purpose, and incontinent he commaunded all the Chrystians that were in hys Countrey, to come togither, whiche was a great number, and they being come before hym, he cause thē to reade those Scriptures of Iesus Christ. And after that e∣uery one of them had hearde it, he asked them if they beléeued that these sayings were true, and they answered yea. Incōti∣nent said the 
Calipho
 to them, I wil giue you fiftéene days re∣spite, to make either yōder hil to passe to such a place, or else to


renounce youre fayth in Iesus Christe as false, and to turne 
Moores,
 and if you will not doe this, you shall all die. And the Christians hearing this cruell sentence, were sore troubled, yet on the other part they comforted themselues, with hope in the faith they had in the truth they beléeued. And incontinent the Bishops, and Prelates, and Ministers that were among the Christians, commaunded all the Christians, men, wo∣men, and children, to fall to continuall Prayer to oure Lorde Iesus Christ, that he would helpe and councell them howe to rule and gouerne themselues in that greate trouble and néede.


And after eyght dayes were past, appeared an Angell to a holy Bishop, and commaunded him that he should say vnto a Shomaker that was a Christian, that had but one onely eye, that he should make Prayers to God, the which for his fayth and Prayers, shoulde make that hill remoue from his place, into the place the 
Calipho
 had appoynted. And incontinente the Bishop sente for that Shomaker, and with great desire prayed him to make Prayers to oure Lord God, that for hys m
rcie and pitie he woulde remoue that hill as the 
Calipho
 and 
M
ores
 had appoynted. The poore Shom
ker excused him∣selfe, saying, he was a greate Sinner, and vnworthy to de∣maund that grace of God: and this excuse he made with great humilitie, like a iust and chast man, full of vertue and holy∣nesse, and a kéeper of Gods commaundements, deuoute, and a great almes man, according to his abilitie.


You sh
ll vnderstande, that thys Shomaker dyd pull out his eye by this meanes: He hadde hearde manye tim
s this saying in the Gospell, 
If thy eye offende thee pull it out, and cast it from thee.
 He being a simple man, thought, that so corporally and m
terially the Scriptures shoulde be vn
erstanded. For it chanced on a time, there came a M
yde into his Shoppe to bespeake a payre of Shoes, and to take the measure of his foote, put off hir hose, and he with∣all was tempted to lye with hir, remembring himselfe, and



hinking vpon his sinne and yll intent, sent hir away, without discouering any thing of his yll thoughte and intente, and re∣membring the saying of the holy Gospell, being ouercome with zeale, and yet not hauing the true knowledge, plucked out his eye. And so this Shomaker being so desired by the Bi∣shop, and other Christians, did graunt, and promised to praye vnto our Lord God for the sayd cause. And the time of the .xv. dayes being come, that the 
Calipho
 had appoynted, he caused to come togither all the Christians, whiche came in Processi∣on with their Crosse, into a faire playne, hard by the hill and Mountayne. And to that place came the 
Calipho,
 with muche people armed, with intention, that streight way, if the Moun∣tayne did not remoue, to kill them all. Incontinente the Shomaker knéeled downe vppon the earth vpon his bare knées, and very deuoutely prayed to oure Lorde, lifting vp his hearte and handes to Heauen, praying to Iesus Christe to succour and helpe them his Christians, that they shoulde not perishe: and for that his faith was cléere, makyng an end of his Prayer, the power of the Almightie God Iesus did cause the Mountayne to remoue and goe from the place it stoode,
 into the place the 
Calipho
 and his Councell hadde commaunded.


And the 
Moores
 séeyng thys greate and manyfest mi∣racle, stoode wonderfully amazed, saying, Great is the God of the Christians, and the 
Calipho,
 with a great number of the same 
Moores
 became Christned. And after this 
Calipho
 dyed, the 
Moores
 that were not Christned, would not consente that this 
Calipho
 should be buried, wheras the other 
Caliphoes
 were buried, for bycause that after that myracle, he lyued and dyed like a true and faythfull Christian.








Of Persia, and of the Countreys of the 
Magos,
 and of other good things that be in them. CHAP. 13.


P
Ersia
 is a noble Prouince or Countrey, al∣though it was much more in the old time, than it is at this present, for it was destroyed by the 
Tartars.
 In 
Persia
 is a Citie called 
Sabba,
 from the which the saying is, the thrée Kings depar∣ted,
 that went to Iesus Christ, that was newly borne in 
Beth∣leem.
 In this citie there are Sepulchres, very faire and beauti∣full, and I 
Marcus Paulus
 was in that Citie, and asked of the people of that Countrey what they could say or knewe of the thrée Kings, to the which they could say nothing, but that they were buried in those thrée Sepulchres. But y
e
 other people out of the Citie thrée dayes iourney, talked of this matter in thys maner following, for the which you shal vnderstād, that thrée days iourney frō the Citie 
Sabba
 is a Towne, which is called 
Calassa Tapeziston,
 which in our language is as much as to say the Towne of them that worship the fire for their God. And these people say, that whē the thrée Kings departed frō y
e
 pro∣uince, for to go to the land of the Iewes, which was 
Bethleem,
 to worship the great Prophet there newly borne, they carried with thē Golde,
 Incense, and Myrre, and when they came to 
Bethleem
 in 
Iudea,
 found a child lately borne, and did worshippe him for God, and presented to him the foresaide thrée things: and that the said child did giue thē a little Boxe, closed, or shut fast, commanding thē they should not open it. But they, after they had trauelled a long iourney, it came in their mindes to sée what they carried in the said Boxe, and opened it, and foūd nothing in it but only a stone: and they taking it in ill parte, that they sawe nothing else, did cast it into a well, and by and by descended fire from Heauen, and burnt all the Well wyth the stone.
 And the Kings séeing this, each of them toke of the


same fire, and carried it into their Countreys: and for thys cause they do worship the fire as God. And when it chanceth in any place in that Countrey that they lacke fire, they goe to séeke it in another place where they cā get of it, and so do light their Lampes. And sometimes they goe and séeke it eyght or tenne dayes iourney, and not finding of it, they goe ofttymes to the Well aforesayd, to haue of the same fire. Of all this be∣fore written, you shall take y
t
 which doth agrée with the holy Gospell, in saying the thrée Kings went to worship our Lord Iesu, and did offer those giftes aforesaide. All that is declared besides that, be erroures, and reacheth not to the truth, but augmēted with lyes vpon lyes, as the vulgar people without knowledge are accustomed to do.






Of eyght Kingdomes in Persia, and the commodities of them. CHAP. 14.


I
N the Prouince of 
Persia
 be eyght Kingdomes, the first is called 
Casun,
 the second which is towardes the South is 
Curdistan,
 the third 
Lore,
 the fourth 
Ci∣estan,
 the fifth 
Iustanth,
 the sixth 
Iciagi,
 the seauenth 
Corchara,
 the eyght 
Tunchay.
 All these Kingdomes be in 
Persia,
 in the partes towards the South, sauing 
Tunchay.
 In these Kingdomes be very faire Horses and Moyles, & cour∣sers of great value, and Asses the greatest in the worlde,
 & of great price, that wil go and runne very swiftely, and these the Merchants of 
India
 do commonly buy in the Cities of 
Atris
,
 & of 
Arcones,
 which do ioyne by Sea vpon the 
India,
 and do sel thē as Merchandise. In this Kingdome 
Tunchay
 be very cruell mē, y
t
 wil kill one another. If it were not for feare of y
e
 
Tartar
 of the East, which is their Lord and King, neyther Merchant nor other could passe, but should be eyther robbed or taken pri∣soner. They be strong people, and be of the sect of 
Mahomet.
 There they do worke, and make greate plentie of cloth of gold


and silke in great abundance and rich. In that Countrey gr
∣weth greate plentie of Cotten wooll.
 Also, there is gr
ate a∣bundance of Wheate, Barly, Dates, and 
ther grayne, and Wine, and Oyles, and frutes.






Of Iasoy, and of many maruellous things there. CHAP. 15.


I
Asoy
 is a goodly Citie and bigge, full of Mer∣chants.
 There they do make great abundance of cloth of gold, and silke. They be called accordyng to the Citie 
Iasoy.
 The people of this Countrey be of the sect of 
Martin Pinol,
 that is, 
Mahomet,
 and do speake another language than the 
Persians.
 And going for∣ward eyght dayes iourney from this Citie, through a playne Countrey, but not peopled, or anye Towne, sauing Moun∣taynes, where is great plentie of Partriches, and wild Asses, at the ende of this, is the Kingdome of the 
Crerina,
 that is, a Kingdome of the 
Persians,
 of a great and long inheritance.


In this Countrey they doe finde greate plentie of pretious stones,
 and of Turkies great store in the Mountaynes, in the whiche Mountaynes, is greate plentie of Vayne, or Ore of Stéele, and of 
Calamita.
 In this Citie, they do make greate plentie of costly saddles, bridles, and harnesses for Horses, and for noble men Swords,
 bowes, and other riche furniture for Horse and Man. The Women of this Countrey doe no∣thing, but commaunde their Seruauntes. They make also there very riche cloth of gold and silke. And in those Moun∣taynes be excéeding good Hawkes, valiaunte, and swifte of wings, that no fewle can scape them. And departing from 
Crerina,
 you shall goe eyght dayes iourney in playne way, full of Cities and Townes, very faire, and there is pleasaunte Hawking by the way, & great plentie of Partriches. And be∣ing past the sayd eyght dayes iourney, there is a going downe


the hil of two dayes iourney, whereas there is great plenty of frutes. In the olde time there was manye Townes and houses, and now there be none but heardmen, that kéepe the Cattell in the field. From the Citie of 
Crerina,
 so this going down, al the winter is so great cold, that although they go very wel clothed, they haue ynough to do to liue. And being past this going downe two dayes iourney forwarde, you shall come into a faire playne way, the beginning whereof is a great faire Citie, called 
Camath,
 the whiche was in the old time noble and greate, and nowe is not so, for that the 
Tartars
 haue destroyed it. That playne is very hote, and that Prouince is called 
Reobarle.
 There be apples of Para∣dise, and Festucas, and Medlars, and diuers other goodly frutes in great abundance. There be Oxen maruellous great, the heare short and soft, and the hornes short, bigge, and sharp, and haue a greate rounde bunche betwéene the shoulders, of two spannes long. And when they will lade these Oxen, they do knéele downe on theyr knées like Ca∣mels, and being ladē, do rise, and they carrie great weight. There the Shéepe be as greate as Asses, hauing a greate tayle, and thicke, that will weigh .32. pound,
 and be maruel∣lous good to eate. In that playne be many Cities & townes with walles, and Towers of a great heigth for the defence of the enimies, called 
Caraones,
 which be certaine Villages. The people of that Countrey their Mothers be 
Indians,
 and their fathers 
Tartars.
 When that people will go a rob∣bing, they worke by enchantment by the Deuill,
 to darken the aire, as it were midnight, bycause they woulde not bée séene a farre off, and this darkenesse endureth seauen dayes. And the Théeues that know well all the wayes, goe togi∣ther, withoute making anye noyse, and as many as they can take, they robbe. The olde men they kill, and the yong men they sell for slaues. Their King is called 
Hegodar,
 and of a truth I 
Marcus Paulus
 do tell you, that I escaped very hardly from taking of these 
, and that I was


not slaine in that darkenesse, but it pleased God, I escaped to a towne called 
Ganassalim,
 yet of my companie they tok
 and slewe many. This playne is towardes the South, and is of seauen dayes iourney, and at the end of them is a moū∣tayne, called 
Detustlyno,
 that is eightéene miles long & more, and is also very daungerous with théeues, that do rob Mer∣chauntes and all trauellers. At the ende of this mountaine is a faire playne, called the goodly playne, which is seauen dayes iourney, in the which there be many wels, and date trées, very good, and this playne bordereth vpon the Ocean Sea, and on the riuer of the sea, is a Citie called 
Carmoe.






Of the Citie Carmoe, and of many mar∣uellous and straunge things that be there. CHAP. 16.


C
armoe
 is a greate Citie, and is a good porte of the Ocean sea, Thither do occupie Merchāts of the 
Indeas
 with spices, cloth of gold & silke, and with precious stones, and Elephantes téeth,
 and is a Citie of great trade, with mer∣chaundize, and is heade of that kingdome, and the king is called 
M
nedanocomoyth.
 It is very hote there, and y
e
 ayre infectious. When there doth dye any Merchaunt, they doe make hauocke of all his goods. In this Citie they do drinke wine made of Dates, putting good spices to it, yet at the be∣ginning of dinner it is daungerous, for those that be not v∣sed to it, for it will make them very soluble, streight waye, but it is good to purge the body. The people of that Coun∣trey do not vse of our victuals, for when they eate bread of wheate and fleshe, by and by they fall sicke. Their victuals is Dates & salte, Tonny, Garlike & Onyons. The peopl
 of that Countrey be blacke, and be of the sect of 
Mahomet.
 And for the great heate in the Sommer, they dwell not in the town, but in the 
 and in gardens, and Orchyards.


There be many riuers and Wels, that euery one hath faire water for his garden: and there be manye that dwell in a desart, wheras is al sande, that ioyneth to that playne. And those people assoone as they féele the great heate, they goe into the waters, and there tarrie till the beate of the daye be past. In that countrey, they do sowe their wheate and corne in Nouember, and gather it in Marche. And in thys time the fruites be greater than in any place. And after March is passe, the grasse, hearbes,
 and leaues of trées doe drie, sauing of Date trées, which continue till Maye. And in that countrey they haue this custome, 
hat when the hus∣band doth dye, the wife and hir friendes doe wéepe once a day, for the space of foure yeares.

 for the crueltie of the king of that c
untrie, wh
e is called 
Ren 
 ela vacomare,
 from whome fewe coulde scape, bu
 eyther were rob∣bed or slayne. And for this cause manye kings did paye him tribute, and hys name is as muche to saye, as the olde man of the mountayne. But I wyll nowe


declare vnto you howe this cruell King was taken priso∣ner in the yeare of our Lord .1272. 
Alan
 King of the 
Tartars
 of the East, hearing of the greate crueltie of this olde m
n of the Mountayne, that he did sent a great host of men, and besette his Castell rounde about, and thus continued three yeares, and coulde neuer take it, till that victuals did sayle them: for it was very strong, and vnpossible to be gotten. At the length 
Alan
 toke the Caste
, and the old man of the Mountayne: and of al his Souldioures and men be caused the heads to be stricken off, and from that time forwarde that way was very good for 
ll trauellers.

And when the day appointed is come for to bury him, the A∣strologers do say, that if he hath layne there one month, it is not good to take him oute of that place, by the iudge∣ment of the Constellations, and for that cause muste first remoue him to some other side of the house, & from thence carry him to bury.

Cane,
 requesting him, that he woulde not restraine them from their auntient liberties and customes, that their anticessors hadde euer vsed, and they for their partes woulde continue the same, otherwise they shoulde be vnthankefull to their Idolls. After the greate

 And they wer wont for to sēd of these napkins, for to hang before the vernacle of oure Lorde Iesus Christ, whome the people of 
Leuant
 do take for a great prophet. Departing from this prouince, and going betwéen the Northeast and East, you shal trauaile tenne dayes iourney and come to little habitation, and at the end of the tenne dayes iourny, you shall find a pro∣uince called 
Sanchur,
 in it be Christians and Idolators, sub∣iects to the great 
Cane.
 The two prouinces beforesaide, to say, 
Chamul,
 and 
Hingnitala
 be called 
Tanguth,
 with the prouince of 
Sachar.
 In all the hilles of this prouince is found greate plentie of Rewbarbe, and there the Mer∣chauntes do buy it, and carry it to all places to sel. There they doe not vse any occupation, but the moste parte doe liue by the laboure of the Countrey.






Of the Citie called Campion, and of many euill vsages there. CHAP. 44.


C
Ampion
 is a greate Citie and fayre, & is the heade of the prouince of 
Tan∣guth.
 In this Citie be thrée sortes of people, that is to say, Christians, Ido∣lators, and Mahomets. The Christiās haue thrée great Churches and faire, and the Idolators haue also Monaste∣ries


Abbeys, and religious houses, more chaste and com∣ly than the other, and they do kil no beast nor fowle there till the fifth day of the Moone, and in those fiue days they liue more honest, deuout, and chast, than in any other time of the yeare. These Idolators may haue thirtie wiues a∣péece, or more, if they be able to maintaine them, but the firste wife is chiefe, and if anye of them doe not contente him, he may put hir away. They do mary in kinreds, and liue like beastes. In this Citie was 
Mapheo Nicholas
 and 
Marcus Paulus
 seauen yeres, vsing the trade of mer∣chaundize.






Of a Citie called Eusina, and of many notable things in 
Tartaria.
 CHAP. xlj.


D
Eparting from the foresayde Cittie 
Campion,
 and trauailing twelue dayes iorney, you shall come to a Citie called 
Eusina,
 the whyche is in a fielde of the Desert called 
Sabon,
 toward the North, and is of the prouince 
Targuth.
 In this Citie they bée al Idolators, and haue great a∣bundaunce of Camels and other cattell withall: they gette their liuing by labouring the ground. In this Citie those that do trauaile, do prouide them of victualles, and other necessaries, for fortie dayes iourney, whyche they must passe through a great. Desert, wheras be no towns nor houses, nor grasse, but in the mountaines about dwel people, and also in the valleys beneath the Desert. There be many Asses and other wild beasts of the mountaines, and greate Pine apple trées. At the ende of this Deserte


there is a Citie called 
Catlogoria,
 whiche is towarde the North, and of this Citie was the first Prince or Lorde a∣mong the 
Tartars,
 and his name was 
Catlogoria.
 The 
Tar∣tars
 dwel towards the North, wheras is but few cities & Townes, but true it is, there be fayre playnes, pastures, riuers, and very good waters. There dwell 
Tartars
 that haue no King nor Lorde, they doe gouerne themselues in common, and do pay tribute to 
Prester Iohn.
 It formned, that these 
Tartars
 multiplyed to so greate a number, that 
Prester Iohn
 did feare, that they woulde rise against him, therefore he determined with himselfe to sende certaine Lordes of his that shoulde be among them to kéepe them asunder, and also to kéepe the countrey in good order, and to banishe or diminishe parte of them, bycause they should not be of so greate a power. And the 
Tartars
 perceyuyng thys, ioyned themselues togither, and tooke councell, de∣termined to leaue that countrey, and to goe and dwell vp∣on the mountaines and in the deserts, by meanes whereof from that time forwarde they stoode in no feare of 
Prester Iohn,
 nor woulde pay him tribute. And at the end of cer∣taine yeares, that they were not vnder the obedience of 
Prester Iohn,
 they did elect and choose among themselues a King whiche they called 
Chenchis,
 a valiaunt and wise man: and this was in the yeare of oure Lorde God .1187. and crowned him for King of the 
Tartars
 aforesaide. And all the 
Tartars
 that were in 
Persia,
 and other Countreys there
boutes, came to him, and put themselues vnder his gouernement, and obeyed him as their King, and he recei∣ued them very friendly, gouerning them iustely and dis∣créetely. And after that 
Chenchis
 was confirmed, and had the whole gouernment, within a short time he made war, and in shorte time conquered righte Kingdomes or Pro∣uinces, and when he hadde gotten anye Prouince or Ci∣tie, he did iniurie to no man, but lette them remaine wyth


their goods, sauing to those that were able and fitte menne for him, they he tooke with him into the warres, and by this meanes he was welbeloued, and all men were con∣tent to goe with him.






Of the beginning of the raigne of the Tartars, and of many maruellous and straunge thinges. CHAP. 42.


C
Henchis
 perceyuyng himselfe to be of suche power, minding to ioyne himselfe in kindred or stocke with 
Prester Iohn,
 sente to him his Embassadoures, re∣quiring his daughter in marri∣age: and this was in the yeare of oure Lord God .1190. 
Prester Iohn
 disdained that Embassage and aunswered, that he maruai∣led muche that 
Chenchis
 being his Subiecte shoulde pre∣sume to demaunde his Lordes daughter to be his wife, saying he woulde rather kil hir: so the matter remayned thus. 
Chenchis
 hearing this aunswere of 
Prester Iohn,
 was sore troubled and vexed in minde againste hym, and incontinent sent him defiaunce, saying, he woulde warre vppon him, and of this 
Prester Iohn
 made small reckning saying, that the 
Tartars
 were but slaues, and not menne of warre, notwithstanding he made himselfe in a readi∣nesse, and came vpon 
Chenchis,
 who had also made him∣selfe in a readinesse, and came oute againste him and en∣countred togither in a great plaine called 
Tanguth,
 where it was appointed the battaile shoulde be of both parties, & thus ioyned togither in a fierce & lōg battel, for both parts


was strong, but in the end, 
Prester Iohn
 being slaine, and many of both parts,
 the field remayned to 
Chenchis,
 who conquered all the prouince, Cities, and townes of 
Prester Iohn,
 and raigned after his death sixe yeares, and at the end of sixe yeares, laying siege to a Castell, was hurte in the knée with an arrowe, and of that wounde dyed. After the death of this 
Chenchis,
 was made Lord of the 
Tartars
 one called 
Cane,
 and this was the firste that was called Emperoure and Greate 
Cane.
 And after hym raigned 
Bathe Cane,
 and the fourth was called 
Chenchis Cane,
 & the fifth was 
Cublay Cane,
 which raigneth nowe. This 
Cublay Cane
 is the greatest and of most power of anye of al his predessors, for among the Christians and Heathen, there is not a greater Prince than he is, nor of so great a power, and that shall you cléerely perceyue hereafter, by that which followeth. All the 
Canes,
 successors of the first 
Chenchis,
 where bu
yed in a mountaine called 
Alchay,
 and there dwelled the greate 
Cane.
 And when the greate 
Cane
 dyeth, they cary hym to be buryed there. Those that do cary him, or go with him, kill as manye as they méete withall in the waye or stréete, and when they kill them, they saye: Go, and serue our Lorde in the other worlde, & they beléeue certainely, that they go, and doe him seruice. And likewise by this reason, when the greate 
Cane
 dieth, they kill all his Camels, Horses, and Moyles, beléeuing that they sēd them to serue their Lord in the other worlde. When 
Monguy Cane
 Lorde of the 
Tartars
 dyed, there was slaine .300000. men that they encountred in the way, by those that wente wyth hym to hys buriall to the saide mountaine.


The habitation of the 
Tartars
 in the Winter, is in the plaine fieldes, where it is warme, and good grasse and pa∣sture for their Cattell, and in the Sommer in the moun∣taines and wooddes, where it is freshe and pleasaunt aire: and they make rounde houses of tymber, and couer them


with feltes, and these houses they carry with them at all times when they do remoue: and alwayes they sette their doore in the Sommer time towards the South, and in the Winter towardes the North. These Tartars haue theyr cartes of Wagons couered with blacke feltes, that neuer any water can passe through, and in these Cartes or Wa∣gons go their wiues, children, and family, and their Cam∣mels do drawe these Wagons. The Tartars wiues doe buy and sell al manner of things belonging to householde, or any thing néedefull: their husbands take no care for it, but onely in hawking, hunting, and going on warrefare. They do eate all manner of fleshe, and drinke milke of all kinde of beastes and mares. The Tartars maye take as manye wiues as they will, and maye marry with anye of their kinred, excepting no degrée: but their firste wife is the chiefest, and is moste made of: the women doe gyue their dowries to their husbandes. There is none of them will haue conuersation with an other mannes wife. And when the father dyeth, his eldest sonne doeth marry wyth his mother in lawe, and when the sonne dyeth, his brother marryeth with hys sister in lawe, and for the time do kéep great solemnitie and feastes at the wedding.






Of the custome, orders, faith and hono∣ring the great Cane, and howe he goeth to the warres. CHAP. 43.


T
He Greate 
Cane
 Emperour of the Tar∣tars, doth worshippe for his God, and I∣doll called 
Nochygay,
 and they saye and beléeue, that he is the eternall God, that taketh care to preserue hym, hys wiues, children, familie, cattell, and corne, and


hathe him in great reuerence, and euery one hath the fi∣gure of that Idoll in his house. And this Idoll is made of feltes, or of other cloth, and of the same felte or cloth they doe make wiues and children for their Idols, and the women be sette on the lefte side of the Idols,
 and the children before them. When they thinke it dinner tyme, then they doe annoynte the mouthes and lippes of theyr Idols, and wiues and children, with the fatte of the sod∣den flesh, and do poure out the broath vpon the floore, say∣ing, that theyr Idols, their wiues, and children doe fill themselues with it, and they do eate the sodden flesh, and their drinke is the milke of Mares trimmed with spices, that it is like white wine, and it is very good, and is cal∣led with them 
Cheminis.
 The Lordes and men of power and riches, goe apparelled in cloth of golde, and cloth of silke,
 furred with riche furres. Their harnesse is the Hydes of Buffe, or other thicke and strong Skynnes. The 
Tartares
 be valiant men of armes, and strong to a∣byde any trauell or laboure, and can well suffer hunger and thirst, for in the warres they be many times one moneth, and eate nothing, but of wylde beastes they doe kill in the field, and drinke Mares Milke. When they be in the field day and night they be on Horsebacke, and the bridle in their hands they giue the Horses meate. When their King setteth forward with his host, before and on euery side of him they do set foure battels of the best and most valiant men, for bycause their King shoulde not bée put in feare. And when he goeth a warrefare a farre off, he caryeth nothing with hym but hys armoure, and a thing to couer him when it doth rayne, and two flaggons with Milke for to drinke, and a Potte to séeth his meate in when néede is. In a tyme of néede hée will ride tenne days iourney, without eating any sodden meate. For his drinke, they will carrie Milke made like dry paste, and when hée is disposed to drinke, he will take a little of that


paste, and dissolue it in fayre water, and so drinke it:
 and when thys shall fayle hym, and that he can gette no other drinke, hée letteth hys Horse bloud, and drinketh of it. When the 
Tartares
 wyll skyrmishe wyth theyr e∣n
mies, they hyde their Sallets secretely, and as they doe beginne to skyrmishe, streightway they shewe as though they woulde runne away, and that they were o∣uercome of theyr enimies, and thus fléeing, putte on theyr Sallets, and streyght way they returne valiantly vpon their enimies, and by this meanes commonly they doe breake the a ray of theyr enimies. The 
Tartares
 haue thys custome,
 that if one of theyr sonnes dye being yong, and also of another man his daughter, after they be dead, they marrie them, saying, they shall be maried in the other worlde. And of thys Matrimonie they doe make a publike writing, and this writing they burne, saying to the dead, that as the smoke thereof ascendeth on high, so doe they sende them that writing, declaring theyr mariage. And at suche mariages they make great feasting and solemnitie, and do séeth muche victuals, and poure out the broath vppon the floore, saying, that those which be dead in this world, and maried in the other, do eate of the victuals prepared for the wedding. And be∣sides all this, they cause to be painted the figure of the sonne and daughter, vppon the backside of the foresayde writing, and withall the pictures of manye Camels, and other diuers beasts, and apparell and money, and many other things, saying, that as that writing dothe burne, all those things therein goe straight way to their chyl∣dren, after the smoke as aforesayde, and the fathers and mothers of these children that dyed, doe take hands togi∣ther, and be alwayes after friendes, and Grandfathers and Grandmothers, and Cousens, euen as though they had bin maried aliue.

 From this Citie trauelling East Southeast, you shall come to a Countrie whiche is a greate prouince, in the whiche there is a great Citie called 
Syrygay,
 that hath neare vnto it many Cities and Townes, all subiect to the greate

Of a maruellous Citie called Liander, and of many maruellous and farre things they haue there. CHAP. 51.


D
Eparting thrée dayes iourney from this Citie, betwéen the Northeast and y
e
 North you shall come to a Citie called 
Liander,
 which 
Cublay Cane
 buylded. In this Citie is a maruellous goodlye Pallace made of M
rble and flint stones, called 
pedras viuas,
 al gilded wyth gold, and neare to this Pallace, is a wall which is in com∣passe fiftéene miles, and within this wall be faire riuers, Wels, and gréene Meadowes, where the great 
Cane
 hath plentie of all kinde of wilde foule and beastes,
 for to finde his Hawkes, called Faulcons, and Gerfaulcons, that bée there in mew, which he at sometimes more than 40000. y
t
 which many times he goeth thyther to sée. Whē he doth ride in these Meadowes, he carrieth behinde him on the buttockes of his horse, a russet or graye Lyon tame, and


setteth him to the stagges, or redde Déere, and to other wylde beastes, and vppon these beastes do the Gerfaul∣cons and Faulcons season. In the middest of these Med∣dowes is a great house, where the great 
Cane
 doth resort to dinner, and to banquet, and to take his reste and plea∣sure in, when he goeth that waye. And this house is com∣passed about with greate Canes, that be gilded and coue∣red with Canes that be varnished, and closed all in one, in such sort, that no water can passe throughteuerye Cane is at the least thrée spannes compasse, and from tenne to fif∣téen paces long. And this house is so made, that at al times they maye take it downe and set it vp againe, vpon a so∣dayne.
 It is tyed with aboue 200. cordes of silke, after the manner of tentes, or pauilions. And the greate 
Cane
 repayreth thither for his pleasure, in Iune, Iuly, and Au∣gust, and there by commaundement of his Prophets, Ido∣laters maketh sacrifice with milke to his Idols, for to preserue and kéepe his wiues, and sonnes, and daughters, and his subi
ctes, and seruauntes, and cattell, and foules, corne, vines, fruite, and all other things in his countries. All the Mares that the great 
Cane
 rideth on, be as white as milke. Among the which, he hath alwayes ten Mares that no body doth drinke of their milke,
 but onlye he and some greate men of his Courte, and some others that hée called honourable and noble, bycause of a victorie had a∣gainst the 
nemies of 
Chenchis
 the first king of the 
Tar∣tars.








Of the sacrifice and other maners, of the life of the greate Cane. CHAP. 52.


W
Hen the great 
Cane
 will make sa∣crifice, he poureth out the Mares milke vpon the ground,
 and in the ayre, and the Prophets of his gods say, that milke poured out, is the holye Ghoste, of the which all the Idols be ful, and do beléeue, that this sacrifice is the cause of his confirmation, and of his subiects, & of al his other things. And this sacrifice he doth euery yere y
e
 29. day of August. And to those white horses and Mares wheresoeuer they do go, they do great reuerence. This greate 
Cane
 hath in his Court certaine Negromanciers, whiche by arte of the Diuel, when it is foule & troubleseme weather, it shal be fayre and cleare weather in his Pallace. And do gyue to vnderstande to the people, that the clearnesse is ouer the Pallace where the great 
Cane
 is, only for his deserts and holy life, and by vertue of his Idols. When anye one is iudged to dye, as soone as he is deade they séeth him, and eate him, but those that dye by natural death, be meat for their Idols.


And besides thys, when the great 
Cane
 is at hys ta∣ble, these inchaunters doe worke by arte of the Diuel, that Cuppes doe rise from the table tenne Cubits into the ayre, and do set themselues down again,
 and whē they wyll doe this, they demaunde of the greate 
Cane
 a blacke shéepe, and the wood of Alloe and Incense, & other swéete spyces, wherof there is great plenty, bicause their sacrifice


séeme the more swéeter, and he commaundeth to be deli∣uered to them, what they will haue, for bycause they be∣léeue that their Idols doe preserue and kéepe him and all his companie. These Prophets and Priestes, do cause the flesh to be sodden with spices in presence of their Idols, & do put incense therin, and poure the broth into the ayre, & they say the Idol taketh of it what pleaseth him: and thys they do with gret singing. Euery Idol hath his name, and to euery one they do this worship on their dayes, as we do on our saints dayes. They haue many Monasteries de∣puted to the names of their Idols. There is in that coun∣trey one Monasterie as big as a good Citie,
 in the which there be 400. Monkes that goe honestly apparelled, and their beardes and heads shauen. Vpon their feaste dayes they kepe great solemnity, with singing, and praysing, and lights, and some of these religious men haue many wiues, and some of them liue chaste: the chast do eate the branne and the meale kneaded togither, with a little hote water, and do fast oftentimes in reuerence of their Idols, and do weare garments made of Canuas died blacke or blewe, & some white, and do lye in Almadraques, sharpe and harde beds, and the other religious that be maried, they go well apparelled, and do eate and drinke wel, and doe saye that those which liue the streight life be Heretickes and fooles, bycause they do punish their bodies, by meanes whereof they can not honor their Idols as they ought to do, and as reason is. All the Idols of these married religious men, they do name by the name of women, bycause they be such leacherous people.








Of a victorie the great Cane had. CHAP. 53.


H
Ere, for your better information, I wyll declare vnto you of a victory the gret 
Cane
 had, wherby you shal the better vnderstand and know of his strength and power. It was he that now raigneth, which was cal∣led 
Cublay Cane,
 whiche is as muche to saye, as Lorde of Lordes. You shall vnderstande that this 
Cublay Cane
 de∣scended lineally of the imperiall stocke, from 
Chenchis Cane,
 from whence he must descende, that shall be Lorde of the 
Tartares
: and this 
Cublay Cane,
 beganne his raigne in the yere of our Lord God .1256. And as 
Chenchis Cane
 by his prouidence and wisedome, made himselfe the firste Lord of the 
Tartares,
 as is before declared, so likewise this for his wisdome and prouidence, contrarie to the good will of his kinred, that would haue put him out of it, did so cō∣serue and gouerne his Dominions and Countries, til the yeare of our Lord God .1298. so that he raigned two and fortie yeares, and was fiue and forty yeares old when he was made Emperor, and euerye yeare hadde warres, for he was valiant and expert in the warres, but he himselfe after he was made Emperour, neuer went to the warres but one time, but alwayes sent his sonnes, or some noble men, whom he thought best. And the cause wherefore hée went at that time in person, was this. In the yeare of our Lord God .1286. a nephew of his, of the age of thirtie yeares Lord of many prouinces, Cities, and townes, per∣ceyuing himselfe to be subiecte to the greate 
Cane,
 as his predecessors had ben, determined in himself not to be sub∣iect to anye, and concorded with another kinseman of the


great 
Canes,
 whyche was called 
Cardin,
 whyche mighte well make .100000. Horsemen, and was mortall enimie to the greate 
Cane
 hys vncle, and did moue warre both of them with theyr hostes agaynste the great 
Cane,
 and hée hauyng knowledge thereof, dyd not feare, for hée was a Prince of maruellous greate power: but incon∣tinent he called hys people togither for to go against hys enimies, and toke an oth, that the crowne shoulde neuer come on his head, till that he had cruelly reuenged hym∣selfe on them as Traytors and Rebels, so that within two and twenty days, he had ioyned particularly a great host of thrée hundred thousand fighting men,
 of horsemen and footemen, and woulde ioyne no greater an host, nor haue it published abrode, that his enimies shoulde haue knowledge of it, and also for that he had many of his men of warre abroade in other places on warfare, and coulde not bring them togither in so short a time. But you shall vnderstande that when the greate 
Cane
 will make his power, and take time to doe it, he may ioyne so greate a number, that it were a greate trouble to number them. These thrée hundred thousande of fighting men, be not all menne of experience, for there were aboue foure thousande Falconers, and Seruants, and Cour∣tiers that attended vppon the Kings person, and ser∣ued in his Courts. But thus hauing his hosts ioyned, he commanded to be called before him his Astrologers, and would know of them in what sort and time he shoulde set forward on this enterprise, and they answered him that the time was good, and that he shoulde haue victorie ouer his enimies, and so incontinent set forwarde on his way with his people, and came to a playne, where as was 
Na∣uia
 with .200000. men tarrying there the comming of 
Caydu
 with another hundred thousand of horsemen, for to set on the Countreys of the great 
Cane.
 The Lordes of


the great 
Cane
 had beset all the wayes, and taken all the streytes, that neither succoure shoulde come, nor his eni∣mies flée, bycause he would take them all prisoners. 
Na∣uia
 knowing nothing of this, or that the great 
Cane
 had prepared himselfe for any warre,
 for the greate 
Cane
 had before beset all the wayes and passages, that no mā could passe to carrie any newes to 
Nauia,
 and by this meanes, not thinking nor stāding in any doubt, thought he might well take his rest that nighte, and all his people: but the 
 
Cane
 was stirring in the morning betimes with all his ho
res, and did sette his Campe hard by the place where as 
Nauia
 had his, and founde them all vna
med, and vnprouided, not thinking any thing of it, and percey∣uing it, he was in greate feare. And the great 
Cane
 had made a great frame vpon an Elephant, wherin his stan∣derdes were caried, and before and behinde, and by the sides went his battels of Horsemen and footemen, that is to say .25000. in a battell. And with these battels be sette all the host of 
Nauia
 round, and when 
Nauia
 sawe thys, he lept on horsebacke, and caused his trumpets to blowe, and set his armie in as good order as he could, and so ioy∣ned battell, whereas was a great and strong fighte, and continued from morning till nighte, and greate number slayne on both parties, but at the end 
Nauia
 and his com∣pany were not able any longer to withstande the furie of the greate 
Canes
 armed men, and beganne to flée, in such sort, that 
Nauia
 was taken prisoner, and his people not being able to doe anye good, submitted themselues to the great 
Cane
: and 
Nauia
 being presented aliue to the great 
Cane,
 he caused him to be bounde vp in a Carpet, and so long hée vsed him to bée caried, that hée dyed,
 and thys deathe hée gaue hym, for that hée woulde not haue the bloud of 
Nauia
 béeing of his kindred, fall to the grounde, nor that the ayre shoulde sée hym dye an euill deathe.


After that 
Nauia
 was deade, all his Lordes and other prisoners became sworne to the great 
Cane,
 to be obediēt to him. These foure prouinces were vnder the obedience of 
Nauia,
 that is to say, 
Furciorcia, Guli, Baston, Scincinguy.


Now that I haue shewed you of the great 
Cane,
 howe he paste with 
Nauia,
 I will also declare vnto you, of hys manner, condition, and person, and of his wiues and chil∣dren, and of other things.






Of the personage of the great Cane, and of his wiues and children. CHAP. 54.


T
He great 
Cane
 that was called 
Cubla Cane,
 was a manne of a 
iddle stature, well fleshte, and of good complexion, and wel pro∣portioned in al his mēbers, well coloured of face, his eyes black, his nose well made: he hath four that be his Legitimate wiues, and his eldest sonne, that he hath by his first wife, doth kepe Court by himselfe, and euerye one of these foure Quéenes, haue in their Courtes 300. wayting women,
 and many maydens, with also many mē and women, that do seruice in the Courtes: for euery one of these foure Quéenes haue in their Courtes more than 4000. persons, of men, women, maydens, and seruaunts. Also the greate 
Cane
 hath many Concubines of 
Tartars,
 which be called 
Origiathe
 and be of a good and honest beha∣uiour,
 and of these the greate 
Cane
 hath a hundreth may∣dens chosen out for himselfe, which be in a pallace by thē∣selues, and haue auntient women to kéepe them. And of


these hundreth, euery thrée dayes sixe of them doe serue and attend vpon the great 
Cane
 in his Chamber, and the thrée dayes being past, they doe returne to their Pallace agayne, and other sixe come for to kéepe the great 
Canes
 Chamber.
 And thus they do remoue from thrée dayes to thrée dayes. The sayd great 
Cane
 had by his sayd wiues two and twentie Sonnes, the eldest of them is called 
Chinchis,
 in remembrance of the first King of 
Tartares,
 and also to renue that name, this firste sonne is called 
Chinchis Cane,
 and shoulde haue succéeded his father in the Kingdome, but bycause he dyed before his father, his eldest sonne called 
Themur Cane,
 and this his sonnes sonne, bycause he should raigne after him, kepte a greate Court by himselfe.






Of a greate Citie called Cambalu, and of all the goodly and maruellous things that be done there. CHAP. 55.


N
Ow I will declare vnto you of the worthy and noble Citie called 
Cambalu,
 the whiche is in the prouince of 
Cathaya.
 This Citie is foure and twenty myles compasse, and is fouresquare, that is, to euery quarter sixe miles compasse. The wall is very strong, of twenty pa∣ces high, and battlements of thrée paces high. The wall is fiue paces thicke, This Citie hathe twelue gates, and at euery gate is a very faire pallace. And vpon the toppe of euery corner of the said wal is also a faire pallace, and in all these pallaces ioyning to the wall be many people appoynted for to watch and kéepe the Citie. And in those pallaces be all maner of armour and weapons for the de∣fence and strength of the Citie. The stréetes of this Citie be so faire and streight, that you may sée a Candle or fire


from the one ende to the other. In this Citie be manye fayre Pallaces and houses. And in the middest of it is a notable greate and faire Pallace, in the whiche there is a great Toure, wherein there is a greate Bell, and after that Bell is tolled thrée times, no body may goe abroade in the Citie, but the watchmen that be appoynted for to kéepe the Citie, and the nurses that doe kéepe children newly borne, and Phisitions that goe to visit the sicke, and these may not go without light. At euery gate night∣lye there is a thousand men to watch, not for feare of any enimies,
 but to auoyde théeues and robbers in the Citie, which many times do chance in the Citie. And this great watche the greate 
Cane
 doth cause, to conserue and kéepe h
s people and subiects, that no man should do them hurt, Without this Citie be twelue suburbes very greate, and euery one of thē answereth to his gate of y
e
 Citie. And in these be many Merchantes and men of occupations: and thyther do resort all people that come out of the Coun∣treys,
 and such Lordes as haue to do with the King or his Courtes. And in these suburbes be moe than twentye thousande single or common women, and neuer a one of them maye dwell within the Citie on payne of burning. Out of this Citie goeth euery daye aboue a thousande Cartes with silke. The great 
Cane
 is garded euery night with twentie thousande Gentlemen on Horsebacke, not for any feare, but for dignitie. They be called 
Chisitanos,
 which is as much to say, as Knightes for the body, or tru∣stie Knights. The manner of the great 
Cane
 for his din∣ner, is this: They make ready all the Tables rounde a∣bout the Hall, and in the middest of the Hall, is made ready the Table for the greate 
Cane,
 setting his backe towardes the North, and his face towardes the South. His firste wife sitteth next vnto him on hys lefte hande, and his other wiues following orderly. On his other side do sitte his sonnes, and his sonnes children, one after a∣nother,


according to his age. Those that be of the impe∣riall lignage, do sitte downe afterward at another table more lower. And the other Lords and their wiues do sitte at other Tables more lower, according to their degrées, dignities, offices, estates, and age. At the saide Tabl
s commonly do sitte foure thousand persons, or very néere,
 and euery one may sée the great 
Cane
 as he sitteth at his dinner. In the middest of the Hall is a very greate ves∣sell or cesterne of fine gold, that will holde tenne Hogges∣heads, which is alwayes kept full of perfect good drinke. And néere vnto that vessell be other foure vessels of siluer bigger than that, full of good wine, with many other ves∣sels and pottes by them, of gold, and of siluer, which may be of pottels a péece, or as muche as will serue foure men for a dinner. At dinner, out of the vessell of golde, wyth pottes of golde, they drawe wine for to serue the greate 
Cane
 his Table, for him, his wiues, children, and kin∣dred: and out of the vesselles of siluer,
 with Iars and Pottes of siluer, they drawe wine to serue the Lordes and the Ladies, and all others sitting at the Tables, as well wemen as men. And euery one that sitteth at the tables hathe a cuppe of golde before hym to drinke in. And euery one that bringeth anye seruice to the greate 
Canes
 Table, hathe a towell of golde and silke be∣fore his mouth, bycause his breath shall not come vppon the meate and drinke they bring. When the great 
Cane
 will drinke, all the Musitians that bée in the Hall doe play, and euery one that serueth, knéeleth downe tyll hée haue drunke. In the Hall be alwayes Iesters, Iuglers, and fooles, attending vpon the Tables, to make pastime all dynner tyme, and after Dinner is done, and the Tables taken vppe,
 euerie man goeth aboute his busi∣nesse. All the 
Tartares
 kéepe greate feasting and chéere euery yeare on the daye that 
Cublay Cane
 was borne, which was on the eight and twentith day of September,


and that is the greatest feast they make in all the yeare saue one, that héereafter shall be spoken of. The greate 
Cane
 doth apparell himselfe that day he was borne on in cloth of golde maruellous rich, and .12000. Barōs be ap∣parelled with him after the same sorte touching the cloth of gold,
 but not so rich and preciouse, and euery one of thē hath a great girdle of gold, and that apparell and girdles the great 
Cane
 giueth them.
 And there is neuer a one of those garments with the girdle, but it is worth .10000. Bisancios of golde, whiche may be a thousand Markes. By this you may perceyue, that he is of great power and riches. And on the sayde day, all the 
Tartares,
 and Mer∣chantes, and subiects, and those that dwell in his Coun∣treys, be bounde to presente vnto hym euery one some∣thyng, according to his degrée and abilitie, in knowled∣ging him to be their Lorde. And whatsoeuer he be that doth begge any office or gift of him, must giue him a pre∣sent, according to the gift he doth aske. And all his Sub∣iects and Merchantes, and trauellers, or anye other that be founde in his Countreys or Prouinces, be vsually bounde to pray for the greate 
Cane
 to hys Idols, to pre∣serue hym and hys Countreys, whether they be Tar∣tares or Christiane,
 or Iewes, or Moores. The 
Tartares
 begin their yeare the firste day of February, and do kéepe a great feast that day. And the greate 
Cane
 and hys Ba∣rons, with all the rest of the Citie, doe apparell them∣selues in white that daye, making greate pastymes, saying, the greate 
Cane
 is bl
ssed and fortunate, and so doe desire a ioyfull yeare. And on that daye there is pre∣sent
d to the great 
Cane
 more than .10000. Horses and Mares al white,
 and more than fiue thousand Elephāts, with two greate baskettes vpon them full of prouision necessarie for hys Courtes. And besides thys, there is presented to hym a great number of Camels, couered all with white cloth of silke, for seruice of their K. And when


they giue these presents, they doe all passe by, where the great 
Cane
 doeth stande and sée them. On the same daye that this feast is, in the morning b
times, before the Ta∣bles be couered, all the kings, Dukes, Marquesses, Lords, Captaynes, Gouernours, and Ius
ices of his countryes, & other officers, come into the Hal before y
•
 presence of the great 
Cane,
 and those that can not come in, be in another place, where as the great 
Cane
 may sée them all: and thus being altogither as though they woulde make some re∣quest, there goeth one vppe vpon a buylding or scaffolde that is made for the same purpose,
 in the middest of the hall, & with a loude or high voyce, biddeth them al knéele downe vpon their knées, and giue landes and thankes to their Lord, and streight wayes euery one doth honor him as if he were an Idoll: and this they doe foure times, and thys being done, euery one goeth and sitteth downe in his place, and afterwardes do rise one after an other, and goe to an aulter, whiche is set in the middest of the hall, and vpon it is a table set, written on with letters of gold, and garnished with pretious stones of greate value, and the writing is the proper name of the greate 
Cane,
 and wyth Sensors of fine golde full of incense and fire, they incense that table in honour of the great 
Cane.
 And after that, eue∣ry one in presence of the great 
Cane,
 doth offer great and precious giftes according to his state, condition, and abi∣litie, and this being done, they go all and sitte downe at the tables to dinner. And the great 
Cane
 thirtéene times in the yeare doeth giue apparell to his Barrons,
 in thirtéen great feastes he doeth make, and at euery time he doeth chaunge this apparel, and this apparel that he doth giue, is of greater and lesser value, according to the degrée of him that he giueth it vnto. And to euerye one he giueth a girdle, or a payre of hosen, or a hatte, garnished wyth golde, and set with pearles and pretious stones, according to the degrée of the parties: and of this apparell is euerye


yeare .1
6000. and this he doth for to honour and magnifie his feastes. And at euery such feast the gret 
Cane
 hath ly∣ing at his féete a tame Lyon, vpon a rich Carpet. And the great 
Cane
 is resident, during the sayde thrée moneths, in 
Camballo,
 that is to say, December, Ianuarie, and Febru∣arie And during the sayd three months, the whole country thereabout, to say thirtie dayes iourney, is kept for haw∣king, hunting, and fouling, only for to serue the Courtes, and what they do take and kil, is presented and broughte to the greate 
Canes
 Courte,
 and such as dwell further of in other prouinces that kill wilde beastes, not able to bée brought to the Court, they do trimme and dresse the skins thereof, and bring them to the Courte for to dresse, make, and trimme armour and munitions, for the wars, which he hath infinite number.






Of the manner the great Cane doth vse in his hunting. CHAP. 56.


T
His 
Cublay Cane,
 or great 
Cane,
 hath wyth him two noble men, that be his brethren, the one called 
Baian,
 and the other 
Mytigan,
 and they be called 
Cini∣cil,
 whych is as muche to say, as mai∣sters or gouernours of the dogs or Ma∣sties of theyr Lordes, eyther of these two noble menne, hath tenne thou∣sande menne all apparelled in one liuerye of whyte and redde, and euerye one of these twentie thousande menne hath charge and gouernemente of two Mastyes, or at the le
st one, and when the great 
Cane
 wyll go on hun∣ting, these two noble men go wyth him with theyr twen∣tye thousande men, or with the moste parte of them, and


so beginne their hunting with those men and dogges, who be well vsed to it, and the great 
Cane
 goeth into the mid∣dest of the fields, hauing his two Lordes with their men and dogges on eche side of him, and diuideth them into companies, in such sorte, that there shal no game rise, that shall scape them, what kynde of beaste so euer it bée.






Of the manner of his hauking for wildefoule. CHAP. 57.


T
He first day of March, the great 
Cane
 de∣parteth from 
Cambalu
 and goeth with his Court and Barons,
 towards the South seas, named the 
Occean,
 that lyeth two dayes iourney from 
Cambalu,
 and he car∣rieth with him ten thousande Faulcons, fiue thousand Gerfaulcons, and other kinde of Haukes a great number, which are very singular and good, aboue all other, and are bred in his Seniories, and al those that they take in his countries are presented to the great 
Cane,
 for his own vse, Court, and Barrons, that alwayes kepe his companie, which are neuer lesse than 15000. and they bée called 
T
stores,
 which is as much to say, as the Lords gard, & all these do practise hauking, and euery one of them doth carry his reclayme or lewer, and haukes hood, that when he hath néede he may take vp his Hauke.
 They doe neuer léese one of these Faulcons, for euery one of them hath fast∣ned vnto hys Belles a Scutchion of gold, wherin is writ∣ten the name of hys Mayster, and when soeuer one of thē is loste, he that findeth him streyghte wayes doeth


present him vnto the great 
Cane,
 or to one of those barrōs his brethren, and he causeth hym to be deliuered agayne, to him that before had charge of him, for he is knowen by the Scutchion that the Hauke hath vpon his belles.






Of the manner that the great Cane hath in trauelling in his countrey, and how he abydeth in the fields in his tents and pauilions. CHAP. 58.


W
Hen the greate 
Cane
 maketh any iourney in his countrey, he goeth in a fayre lodge or edification, hauing a verye faire cham∣ber made vpon foure Elephants, which is couered with the skinnes of Lions, and in this chamber he hath twelue Gerfaulcons,
 and certain of the Barrons in his company to giue him pleasure and pa∣stime: and round about these Elephants there be on horse∣backe very many barrons, and as soone as they sée anye foule, or Crane fly, they declare it vnto their Lord, and he immediately, letteth these Gerfaulcons flye: 
nd after this sort he goeth through his countrey: and when the greate 
Cane
 commeth to any broade and faire fields, which they do call 
Caziam
n,
 which he doth finde ready set with tents and pauilions for him and his wiues, and for his children and barrons, and these tentes and pauilions, are at the least .10000. and the tentes of the great 
Cane
 are so large,
 that when they are set vp, there may be vnder and walke at theyr ease .2000. knights, and the entring into them o∣peneth towardes the South, and one of the tentes is for the Barrons and Knightes that are of the Lordes garde, and in a smaller tente that standeth by it, opening to∣wardes the Septentrion, edified wyth faire chambers,


wrought all with golde, ordayned for y
e
 great 
Cane
 where he kéepeth Courtes, and audience to all them that come: and in this tent there be two chambers with faire Halles, and the feelings is susteined vppon thrée pillers of a mar∣uellous worke, and are couered with Lions skinnes, and of other beasts, wroughte and painted of diuers coloures, so that neyther wind nor raine can enter or passe through, for they are made onely for that purpose: and these cham∣bers and halles, are furred with Ermines and Iebelines or Sables, whiche Sabels is so pretious, that one furre for a Knighte are or is worth .2000. Bysancios of gold.
 All the cordes of these tents are of silke, and these twoo tentes are of suche value, that a meane King thoughe he do sell all his lande, is not able to buy them▪ And rounde aboute these two tentes stande manye other tentes being verye faire, for the Barons, and for the other people, so wel set and ordayned, that it séemeth to be a greate Citie: & from euery place there commeth people to sée the mightinesse & pleasure of the greate 
Cane.
 There goeth with the greate 
Cane
 all his Courte that he kéepeth in 
Cambalu,
 and in the place he remayneth hunting and hawking vntil al the mo∣neth of Aprill, for there they finde greate plentie of wilde∣foule, for that there be great lakes and riuers. When the greate 
Cane
 goeth on hawking for wilde foule, there may no man hawk néere him, not within twentie dayes iorny, vppon a great penaltie. And from the beginning of March vntill October, there is no Baron nor subiecte vnto the great 
Cane,
 that dare take any wild beast or foule▪ though there be very greate plentie in that countrie, vppon great penaltie, and when the time of his hawking is ended, hée returneth vnto the Citie of 
Cambal
,
 hawking by the way, and néere vnto the Citie he doth kéepe solemne cheare .iij. dayes. Within the saide Citie they lodge no straungers,
 nor bury any dead corps. There commeth vnto this Ci∣tie merchandize from all parts of the world, cloth of gold


and of silke, pretious stones and pearles, and great plentie of other notable thinges to maintaine the magnificence of the greate 
Canes
 Courte that he hathe, and for the greate resorte of people that come thither: and this Citie is sci∣tuated in the middest of his prouinces and countries.






Of the money that is vsed in all that countrey. CHAP. 59.


T
He greate 
Cane
 causeth his money to be made in this manner, causing the rine of a Mulberry trée to be cut very thinne, whiche is between the vtter rine and the trée, and of this he maketh mony both small and great, whiche some of them is worth halfe an ounce, some an ounce,
 some ten groats, some twentie, some thirtie, and same worth a Bisanco of golde, and some of twoo Bisan∣coes, and so they rise vntil tenne Bisancios of gold. This money is stāped with the signe of the Lord, & it is currant in al his Country, and in al the prouinces which are sub∣iect vnto him, & no man may refuse this mony, for if he do he must léese his head,
 & he that doth counterfet hys coine shall be destroyed vnto the third generation There com∣meth sometimes vnto the Courte of 
Cambalu,
 Merchants that bring golde and pretious stones for to buy the cloth of golde and silke, and other Merchaundizes in quantitie of thrée thousand Bisancios of golde, and many times the greate 
Cane
 commaundeth, that all the golde, siluer, and pretious stones, that may be founde in the Merchauntes handes, and subiectes of his dominions, shoulde be deliue∣red to his treasurers, and so they doe, and they be paid for it in this saide money, which is made of the rine of a Mul∣bery


trée, that they may sée how al the gold, siluer, pearle & pretious stones is closed vp in his treasury being boughte for this vile money of no value, so that little golde, si
uer, pearles and pretious stones commeth out of his country: and after this sorte he maketh himselfe the richest Prince of the worlde.






Of the order and rules that he hath in his dominions. CHAP. 60.


T
He great 
Cane
 hathe sette tenne Barons or noble men of greate estimation to go∣uerne .64. prouinces and countries subiects vnto him,
 and they euer remaine in hys Citie imperial of 
Cambalu,
 and these tenne Barons doe appoynt Iudges, and Nota∣ries ouer the Countries that are vnder their guiding, of the which euery one of them doth exercise his office in the country that he hath charge of, and these Iudges remaine also in the Citie of 
Cambalu,
 vnder the obedience of those Barons. These tenne Barons do constitute gouernours and officers throughe all the Countries, and doe chaunge them when they liste, and when they haue putte them in the roome, they doe present them before the greate 
Cane,
 and hée doeth accepte them, and giueth them Tables of Golde, and by writing the order howe to vse themselues: and these gouernoures and officers doe gyue them knowledge by letters and messengers vnto the Iudges which are deputies ouer them, and those Iud∣ges doe notifie all things vnto those ten Barons, and they


do make declaration of it vnto the great 
Cane,
 so that af∣ter this manner, he knoweth what is done in hys Coun∣tries, and prouideth for all things necessarie.






Of the saide order. CHAP. 61.


T
Hese ten Barons are called 
Senich,
 which is to say, the principalles of the Court: and these doe prouide for the preseruation of the great 
Canes
 estate, and they do ordain his warres and hostes, and Knightes, and they doe treate and make peace betwéene the Lordes, and they doe make prouision in euery manner of thing that toucheth their Lordes estate, and to all his dominions, but they lette nothing passe, vntill suche time as their Lorde do vnderstande it.






Of the Citie Cambalu. CHAP. 62.


T
He Citie of 
Cambalu
 hathe manye outlettes and gates, that thoroughe them they maye goe vnto diuers prouinces and countries, & when they goe from thence, for to goe vnto 
Cataya,
 they finde a great mountaine, where there is blacke stones, & they burne like wood, when they be well kindled they will kéep a fire from one day to an o∣ther, which I suppose be of the nature of oure Sea-coles, and they do burne of them in that Country, thoughe the haue woodde, but the woodde is more dearer than are the stones or seacoales.








Of the meruailous things that be founde in that countrey. CHAP. 63.


T
He great 
Cane
 sent me 
Marcus Paulus

And when the good man spyeth the signe or token, he entreth into hys house. This vse they doe kéepe thorough all that Countrey, and take it for no shame, although the Strangers do vse their wiues. But rather they doe take it in greate honor and estimation, that they do so well enterteyne the Strangers. And theyr Idols tell them, for that they doe honoure the Strangers, their Gods do encrease their substance. The people of this Coūtrey do vse money made of gold,

This peruerse custome was among them before they be∣came

 they dare not doe anye such thing, and therefore become a greate deale better people, and of a better disposition.






Of the Prouince named Cingui, and of many things that be there, and of the Citie named Caucasu. CHAP. 82.

 All the men of this Prouince haue their téeth couered with golde. And the women do dresse their Horses.
 The men doe no other thing, but goe on Hunting, passing the time in the fields, and goe vnto the warre. The women doe buy and sell, and do all things necessarie belonging to the house, and gouerne all the goodes, and their men and women Ser∣uantes. Ouer and aboue this, the women of this Coun∣trey haue this custome, that as she is deliuered of childe, she riseth and wrappeth the childe,
 and dothe all things belonging to the house, and receyueth no more payne, than though she had not bin deliuered of childe, but in gi∣uing the childe sucke, and as soone as she is deliuered, the husband lyeth in the bedde, laying the childe by hym, as though he had borne it himselfe, for the space of fortye dayes, and the woman dothe serue him.

,
 in stead of money. These people haue no Idols, but euery house∣holde worshippeth theyr Superiour and Mayster. None of them can write nor reade, for that they dwell among the moyst Mountaynes, corrupted with euill ayres. In thys Prouince, and in the other two afore specifyed, there be no Phisitions, but when they doe fall sicke, they cause to come vnto their houses certayne Ministers, which vse inchantmentes by the power of the Diuell, and declare the sicknesse that the diseased hathe, and these Ministers sounde their instrumentes in honor of theyr Idols,
 in so muche that the Deuill entereth into one of those Mini∣sters, Inchanters, or Idols, and falleth downe as though hée were dead, and those Ministers, or Maysters of the Idols, demaunde of hym that lyeth inchanted, or in a trance, wherefore that man fell sicke, and hée aunswe∣reth, for that he hathe angered suche or suche an Idoll, and then those Maysters or Ministers of the Idols saye vnto him that is inchanted, we request thée to pray vnto that Idoll that is angrie wyth the sicke bodye, to pardon hym, and wyll make hym Sacrifice with hys owne bloud. And if hée that is in thys trance, doe be∣léeue that the disease is mortall, hée aunswereth, thys sicke man hathe so displeased the Idoll, that I knowe not whether he will pardon hym or not, for that hée hathe determined that hée shoulde dye, and if he thyn∣keth that hée shall escape hée sayeth, if hée wyll lyue, it behoueth hym to gyue vnto the Idoll so manye Shéepe that haue blacke neckes, and to dresse so many sortes of meates dressed with spices, sufficient to make the sacrifi∣ces vnto the Idoll that is angry with him, and for the mi∣nisters that serue him, and for the women that serue in


his temple, whiche is all fraude and guile of the inchan∣ters for to gette victuals, by this meanes all are damned vnto Hell. To this banket there is conuited the maisters and ministers of the Idols, the inchanters and women that serue in y
e
 temple of that Idoll. And before they sitte downe to the Table, they doe sprincle the broath aboute the house, singing and daunsing in the honor of that I∣doll. And they doe aske the Idoll, if he haue forgiuen the sicke man. And sometimes the Féende aunswereth, that there lacketh such or suche a thing, whiche immediately they do prouide: and when he answereth that he is par∣doned, then they do sitte downe to eate and to drinke that sacrifice which is drest with spices, and this done, they go vnto his house with great ioy. If the paciente heale, it is good for him, but if he dye, it is an euerlasting payne for him, and if he recouer, they do beléeue that the diuelishe Idol hath healed him, and if he die, they say that the cause of his deathe was for the greate offence that he had done vnto him, and so they be lost as brute beasts in all that Countrey.

Hovve this prouince vvas vvonne by the great Cane. CHAP. 93.


A
Fter that the great 
Cane
 had wonne the prouince of 
Mangi,
 conquested by industry and councell of 
Nicholao
 and 
Mathio
 and 
Marcus Paulus,
 as nowe you shall per∣ceiue in this present chapter: From the hoste of the greate 
Cane
 I write vnto the greate 
Cane,
 that that prouince by no manner of way coulde be wonne or taken, of the whiche newes the greate 
Cane
 was sore abashed, and we perceyuing his heauinesse, wée went vnto hym and sayde: 
Potentissimo
 and mightie Lord, receiue you no conceite nor heauinesse, for wée wil haue suche means, that this prouince shall come into youre hands: who bée∣ing comforted with oure promise, gaue vs full power and libertie to doe all those things that vnto vs should séeme beste, and that we shoulde be obeyed as to his owne pro∣per person. And then I 
Marcus Paulus
 tooke vppon mée this charge, and gathered togither certaine 
Venetians
 that I founde in those Countries, being discréete menne, and exercised in feates of armes, and I caused to be made thrée greate Trabuco or greate péeces of ordinaunce, whiche shotte a pellet of a thousande pounde waighte, and hadde them vnto the campe, and planted them where they should be shotte off, and this done, by the meanes of these péeces I shotte into the Citie greate pellettes, and when those of the Citie saw their houses fall about their eares, by suche meanes as they neuer saw nor hearde of before, they receyued great feare, and immediately they yéelded themselues vnto the great 
Cane.

 and this Citie is scituated vpon the greatest riuer of the world named 
Tuognrou
 which is .17. miles in breadth, and one hundred dayes iorney in length, and there is neuer a riuer in the worlde,
 where there sayleth so manye shippes with Mer∣chaundizes, as there. And I 
Marcus Paulus
 was in this Citie, and did tell standing vpon a bridge at one time fiue thousande shippes or barkes that sailed vppon this riuer, and vppon this riuer there standeth two hundred Cities. being greater than this that we haue spoken of. Thys ri∣uer passeth throughe sixetéene prouinces.

Cambalu,
 that the great 
Cane
 may haue greate plentie of victualles in his Courte. This Citie standeth to∣wardes the 
Siroco,
 and they doe carry this prouision vnto



Cambalu
 vpon this riuer, and not by sea. Therefore there commeth through this riuer greate profite vnto 
Cambalu,
 for it is better prouided with barkes than with cartes, or horses.

The people of this Countrey eate mans flesh, so that he dye not of naturall death. When the people of this Countrey go vnto the warres, they doe make certayne signes in their forheads, to be the better knowen: and they go all on foote, except their Lorde, who rideth on Horsebacke.

Of the Ilande named Ciampagu, and of things which be found there, and how the great Cane would conquer it. CHAP. 106.


I
 Will passe from hence vnto the Countreys of 
India,
 where I 
Marcus Paulus
 dwelte a 
ong time: and although the things which I will declare, séeme not to be beléeued of them that shall heare it, but haue it in a certayne∣tie and of a truth, for that I sawe it all with mine owne eyes.
 And now I will beginne of the Iland named 
Ciam∣pagu,
 whiche standeth in the high Sea towardes the Ori∣ent, and it is separated from the mayne land .1500. miles. The people of this Countrey are fayre, and of good ma∣ners, although they be all Idolaters. There is in thys Iland a King franke and frée, for he payeth no tribute at all to any Prince. The people of this Countrey speake the Persian tong.
 And there is found in this Iland great plenty of golde, and they neuer haue it forthe vnto anye place out of the Ilande, for that there commeth thy∣ther fewe Shyppes, and little Merchandise. The Kyng of thys Ilande hathe a maruellous fayre


and great Pallace,
 all couered with golde in pas
e, of the thicknesse of a péece of two Ryals of plate. And the win∣dowes and pillers of this Pallace bée all of golde. Also there is greate plenty of precious stones. And the great 
Cane
 knowing of the greate fame and riches of this I∣land, determined to conquere it, and caused to be made great prouision of munition and vittayles, and a greate number of Shippes, and in them he put many Horsemen and footemen, and sent them vnder the gouernance of two of his Captaynes, the one was named 
Abatan,
 and the other 
Vonsaucin,
 and these two went with this great ar∣mie from the Hauen of 
Iaython
 and of 
Glunsay,
 and they went vnto the Iland 
Ciampagu,
 where they went alande, and hauing done great hurt in Mountaynes and valleys, there entred suche enuie and hatred betwéene these two Captaynes, and so much discord, that loke what the one would haue done, the other did againe say it, and through this meanes they toke neyther Citie nor Towne, but on∣ly one, and they killed all them that they founde therein, for that they would not yéeld, sauing eyght men, whyche could not be killed with any iron,
 for that eache of them had a precio
s stone enchanted in his righte arme, be∣twéene the fleshe and the skynne, and these stones did de∣fend thē from death to be killed with yron, and knowing of it, these two Captaynes procured to kill these eyghte men with clubs of wodde, and toke those stones for them selues, and in that instant there arose suche a tempest of wind of Septentrion or North so terrible, and doubting that their Shippes would breake, they hoysed vp Sayle, and went vnto another Iland, tenne miles distant off frō this, and the wind was so terrible, that it opened many of their Ships, and manye were forced to make backe to∣wards their owne Countrey againe, and about .30000. of them fledde by land, of these they thought that they were all killed. And as soone as it was caulme on the Sea, the


King of this Iland which had bin so spoyled, wente with a great armie of Shippes vnto the other Ilande, where as they were gone to haue taken them that were fledde, and as soone as hée was on lande with his men, the 
Tar∣tares
 like wise and politike men, retired backe by the I∣lande, and went vnto the Shyppes of this King whiche they had lefte without strength, entred in, hoysed vp the Sayles, with the Auncientes and Flagges of that King, whiche they left behinde in the Ilande, and sayled vnto the first Iland, where they were receyued,
 and the gates opened, thinking it had bin their owne King. And in thys manner the 
Tartares
 tooke that Citie, wherein the King had his habitation, and ransacked it. And as soone as the King of this Ilande knewe of it, he caused many other Shippes to be prepared, and with the men that hée had, and many of her that hée tooke of new, enuironed his pro∣per Citie, hauyng it beséeged seauen moneths. And final∣lye the abouesayd 
Tartares
 hopyng for no succoure, dely∣uered vp the Citie vnto the right King, conditionally to let them go with their liues, bagge and baggage. Thys hapned in the yeare of our Lorde .1248. In this Ilande there bée Idols, that some haue heads like Wolues, some heads like Hogges, some like Shéepe, some like Dogs, some haue one head and foure faces, some thrée heads, hauing one only necke, and onely one right hande, some haue onely one lefte hande, some haue foure handes, and some tenne, and the Idoll that hath most handes, is taken to be the most beautifull: and to him that demaundeth of them, wherefore they haue so many Idols, they doe gyue no other reason, sauing that so did their predecessors. Whē the people of this Iland do take in battell any stranger, if he doe not caunsome himselfe for money, they kill him, drinke his bloud, and eate his flesh. This Ilande is enui∣roned round about with the Occean sea. The portes are frée for themselues. The Marriners which vse that Sea,


say,
 that there is in it .7448: Ilandes. There is no trée there, but he is of a swéete odoure, frutefull, and of greate profite. In this Iland groweth the white Pepper. From the Prouince of 
Mangi
 vnto the 
India
 and home, is a yeares sayling, the reason is, for that there raygneth two stedfast windes, the one in the winter, and the other in the Sommer, contrary the one vnto the other.

Cane

Sagato,
 with a greate armie, to conquere that Prouince, and hée coulde do nothing, but destroy muche of that Countrey, and for that he should do no more hurt, that King became tributarie vnto the greate 
Cane,
 and euery yeare he sente him his tribute. And I 
Marcus Paulus
 was in this coun∣trey in the yeare of our Lord .1275. and I found this King very olde. He had many wiues, and amongst sonnes and daughters he had .325.
 Among his sonnes he hadde .25. of them that were very valiante men of armes. In thys Countrey there be many Elephants and Lyons greate plenty, and great Mountaynes of blacke Ebbante,

Sondure,
 and the other 
Con∣dur.
 And beyond these two Ilands almost two hundreth miles, stan∣deth the Countrey name 
Iocathe,
 great and rich. They speake the Persian tong, and worship Idols. They pay no kinde of tribute to any man, for there is no man that can do them hurt. There is found greate plentye of gold, and a greate number of the small white shels of the Sea,

S
Ayling beyond 
Iocath

Penthera,
 full of Mountaynes. And in the middes of this Iland, about forty miles, there is but foure passes of water, there∣fore the great Shippes do take off their Rudders: and being paste these fiue miles towards the midday, you come vnto a Realme named 
Malenir.
 The Citie and the Iland is named

They haue scant of victuals. From this Ilande you can not sée the North Starre little nor muche. Beyonde it standeth the Realme of 
Ferlech.
 The people are Moores. They do honor 
Martin Piniolo,
 which is Mahomet. There dwell others in the Mountaynes that haue no kind of law. They doe liue as beastes, ho∣nouring the first thing that they do sée in the morning, as their God. They doe eate all kinde of dead fleshe, and the fl
sh of man, caring not howe, nor yet after what sorte it dyeth.








Of the realme named Bassina, and of the Vnicornes, and other wilde beastes. CHAP. 111.


G
Oing from 
Ferlech
 you come vnto y
e
 realme of 
Bassyna,
 wher the people are without law, liuing as beastes, being subiect at their will vnder the gret 
Cane,
 although they do giue him no tribute, sauing, that at sometimes when it pleaseth them they do sende vnto him some strāge thing. In this realme there be Apes of diuerse sorts, and Vnicornes, little lesse than Elephants, hauing a head like vnto a swyne, and alwayes hanging it downward to the grounde, and standeth with a good will in Cieno or miery puddel.

The Apes of this country are small, hauing a face like vnto a childe, and those in that countrey do flaye them, so that they looke like vnto a naked childe. They séeth it, and dresse it with swéete spices, so that they haue no euil ayre nor strong sent, and so sodden, they doe sende them aboute in the worlde to sell, saying they be sodden children. In this countrey there be haukes as blacke as Rauens, very strong and good to hauke with.








Of the realme named Samara, and of many straunge things that are founde in the sayd countrey. CHAP. 112.


G
Oing from the Realme of 
Baxina,
 you 
nter into the realme of 
Samara
 beyng 
n this same Iland, where I 
Marcus 
aulus
 was fiue moneths, by fortune of weather, and for feare of the euill peo∣p
e of that countrey, for the most parte 
here liueth vppon mans fleshe. From hence, you sée not the North starre, nor yet the other stars that rule the principal winde, the people there are rustical and worshippe Idols, there is singular good fish, they haue no wine, but they get it in this wise. They haue manye trees like vnto the paulme trée, they breake the braunches and from them commeth water, as it commeth from the vyne. This licour is white and redde like vnto Wine, bée∣ing very perfect to drinke, there is great plentie of it. An∣other realme there is in this Iland, which is named 
Dera∣goya,
 the people are rusticall, and worship Idols. They haue no king, and speake the 
Persian
 speach. In this Iland there groweth great plentie of the 
Indian
 nuts. They haue this custome in this Iland, that when any falleth sicke, his kinsfolke demaunde of them if the patient shall liue or dy. Then these maisters make Diuellish inchauntments, if they say that he shall escape, they let him lye, and if they say that he shall dye, they sende for the Butchers, whiche stoppe his breath till he dye, and when he is deade, they séeth the bodie▪ and the parents eate the flesh, and kepe his bones in a chest. Thys they do, saying, if the wormes had eaten the fleshe they should die for hunger, and the soule of


the deade bodie shoulde iuffer greate penurie in the other world. They do hide this chest with the bones, in a caue of the mountaines, so that it maye not be founde. All the straungers that they doe finde, they kil and eate them, if they be not ransomed for money as soone as they take them.






Of the Kingdome named Lambry, and of the straunge things there founde, and of the realme 
Samphur,
 and of the things founde there. CHAP. 113.


L
Ambry
 is another realme in this Ilande, where there is great plentie of spices. The people are Idolaters. In this realme there be men that haue feathers about their pri∣uities, great and bigge, and of the length of a goose quill. The fift realme of this Iland 
Iaua
 is named 
Samphur,
 where there is found the best 
Camphore
 that is in the world, and it is solde for the waight of gold: here they do vse the Wine of trées. In this prouince there is a kinde of great trée, and it hath a very thinne ryne, and vnder the ryne it is full of singular meale, and of thys meale they do make perfect meats, of the which I 
Marcus paulus
 did eat many times.








Of tvvo Ilandes, and of the euill li∣uing and beastlynesse of the people. CHAP. 114.


G
Oing from 
Lambry
 sayling 140. myles towardes the North, you come vnto two Ilands, the one is named 
Necumea,
 and the other 
Nangania.
 The people of 
Necumea,
 liue like beastes, the men and wo∣men go naked, couering no part of their secrets: they do vse carnallye like beasts or dogs in the stréets, or wheresoeuer they doe finde, without any shame at all, hauing no difference, nor regard, the father vnto the daughter, nor the sonne vnto y
e
 mother, more than vnto another woman, but euery one doth as he lusteth or may. Here there be mountaines of 
Sandolos
 or Saūders, and of nuts of 
India,
 and of 
Gardamo∣nia,
 and many other spyces. 
Nangama
 is the other Ilande, it is fayre and great. The people therof are Idolaters, they liue beastly, and eate mens flesh, they are very cruel, they` haue heades lyke great Mastie dogges, and the men and women haue téeth like dogs. In this Ilande there is great plentie of spices.








Of the Iland Saylan, and many noble things which be founde there. CHAP. 115.


A
Fter that you go from 
Nangana,
 you go towarde the Occident, and decly∣nyng against 
Arbyno
 about ten hun∣dred myles, you come vnto the Iland of 
Saylan,
 whiche is the beste and the greatest Iland in the world, being in compasse thirtie thousand myles. In this Iland there is a very rich king, the people are Idola∣tours, and they goe all naked in this Ilande, sauing that they do weare a linnen cloth before their secretes. There is great plentie of Rice and of cattel, and of the Wyne of trées. In this Iland are founde the best Rubies, that bée in the worlde, and they be founde in no other place than here. And here there be founde manye precious stones, as Topases, Amatistes, and of diuerse other kindes. Thys king hath the fairest Rubie in the world, the length of a spanne, and is as thicke as ones arme, as redde as fire, glistering without any blemmish. The men of this coun∣trey are wonderfull leacherous, and they are worth no∣thing for the warres.








Of the prouince named Moabar, vvher∣in there be fiue kingdomes, and of the noble things that be founde there. CHAP. 116.


P
Assing from thys sayde place, and trauel∣ling towardes the Occident fortie myles, you come vnto a greate prouince nam
d 
Moabar
 in the great 
India.
 This is the greatest and the best prouince that is in y
e
 world, standing in the firme land, being an excellent regi∣gion. There is in thys prouince, Margarites verye fayre and great. This prouince is diuided into fiue kingdomes, wherevpon raigneth fiue brethren legitimate. In the first beginning of this prouince standeth the firste kingdome gouerned by one of those fiue brethren, named 
Sendarba,
 and is entituled as king of 
Nor,
 here is fine great pearles, in great number. This king hath the tenth of all y
e
 pearls whych are founde in his kingdome. The fishermen do fish these pearles, from the beginning of April, vntill the mid∣dest of May, in a gulfe of the Sea, where there is greate plentie of them, they are founde in the Oysters. The men and women of this realme goe all naked, sauing that they do weare a certaine cloth to couer theyr priuities. Also the king goeth naked, and to be knowen, he weareth about his necke a lace full of precious stones, whyche are in number a hundereth & foure, in the remembrance of a hundreth & foure prayers, that he vseth to say in the ho∣nour of his gods morning and euening, and on his armes, legges, féete, and téeth, he weareth so manye precious Stones, that tenne riche Cities be not able to paye for them.


This king hath fiue hundreth wiues, and one of them he toke from his brother. In this realme there be verye faire women of themselues: also they do vse paynting, s
t∣ting more beautie vnto their faces and on their bodies. Thys king ha
h alwayes a greate companie with him, to serue him: when the king dyeth they burne his bodye, and with him of their owne voluntarie willes, all those that accompanied and serued him in his life time, leape into the fire, and burne themselues with him, saying, that they do go to beare their king companie in y
e
 other world, and liue as they did here in this worlde. Yerely this King buyeth tenne thousande horses of the countrey named 
Cormos,
 at the price of fiue ounces of gold euery horse, some more, some lesse, according vnto the goodnesse and beau∣tie of the horse. The merchaunts of 
Quinsay,
 of 
Suffer,
 and of 
Beden,
 sell those horses vnto the merchauntes of this realme. These horses lyue not in this prouince aboue one yeare: by this meanes that king consumeth a greate part of his treasure in horses. In this countrey they doe vse this custome, that is, when a man is condemned to dy, he is begged of the Prince that he maye kill himselfe, and when they haue obtayned the kings good will, he killeth himselfe, in the loue and honour of his Idols. After thys wise, hauing obtayned the kings grace and fauour, the wife of this malefactour and kinred, taketh him, tying a∣bout his necke twelue kniues, and in this manner he is carried by them vnto a place of iustice, where he crieth as lowde as he may, saying, I doe kill my selfe in the honour and for the loue of suche an Idoll, and with one of these kniues striketh himselfe, and then with another, vntyll such time as he falleth downe deade: this done, hys pa∣rents with great ioye and gladnesse burne the dead body, thinking that he is happy. In this countrey euerye man hath as many wiues as he is able to maintain: whē y
e
 hus∣bande


dyeth, according vnto their custome, his bodie is burnt, and 
is wiues of their owne frée willes burne themselues with him, and shée that leapeth firste into the fire, the beholders take hir to be the best. They are all I∣dolaturs, and for the more part of them, worship the Oxe, saying, he is a Sainct, for that he laboureth and tilleth the grounde, where the corne growth, and so by no manner of meanes they will eate anye kinde of Oxe fleshe, nor yet for all the golde in the world, will they kill an Oxe, and when any Oxe dyeth, with his tallow they do rubbe al the insides of their houses.


These people descende of those that killed 
Saint Tho∣mas
 the Apostle, and none of them can enter into 
Sainct Thomas
 Churche, whiche he edified in that countrey: be∣sides this, if one will presume to enter into the Temple, he falleth streight deade. It hath bene proued oftentimes, that some of them would enter perforce into the Church, and it hath not bin possible for them doe it. The king and those of this prouince eate alwayes vpon the ground, and if it be demaunded of them by question why they doe so, they doe aunsweare, for that they doe come of the earth, and to the earth they muste, and they cannot doe so much honour vnto the Earth as is worthy. In thys prouince there groweth nothing else but Rice: these peo∣ple go naked vnto the warres, hauing no other weapon but speare and shield, and they kill no wilde beastes at all for their eating, but they cause some other that is not of their lawe to kill them. All the men and women do wash themselues twice aday, morning, and euening, for other∣wise they dare neyther eate nor drinke, and he that should not kepe this vse among them, shoulde be reputed to bée and Hereticke: and they do washe themselues in thys man∣ner, as we haue rehearsed: they goe all naked, and so they go vnto the riuer, and 
ake of the water, and powre it vp∣on their heads, and then one doth helpe to washe another.


They are good men of warre, and verye fewe of them drinke wine, and those that doe drinke it, are not taken to be as a witnesse, nor yet those that go vnto the Sea, say∣ing, that the Marriners are dronkards. They are despe∣rate men, and estéeme lecherie to be no sinne. This coun∣trey is intollerable hote, and the boyes go altogither na∣ked. It neuer rayneth in that Countrey, sauing in Iune, Iuly, and August. In this Region there be many Philo∣sophers, and many that vse Negromancie, and verye ma∣nie of them that tell fortunes. There be Hawkes as blacke as Rauens, bigger than ours, and good to kill the game. Also, there be Owles as bigge as Hennes, that flye in the ayre all night. Many of those men doe offer their children vnto those Idols that they haue most re∣spect vnto, and when they worship and feast those Idols, they do cause to come before them, all the yong men and maydes, whiche are offered vnto them, and they doe sing and daunce before the Idols, and this done, they do cause their meate to be broughte thither, and they doe eate the flesh, saying, that the smell of the flesh filleth the Idols.






Of the Realme named Musuly, vvhere there be found Adamants, and many Serpents, and of the manners of those in that Countrey. CHAP. 117.


M
Vsuly
 is a Region that standeth beyonde 
Moabar,
 trauelling towards Septentrion which is the North .1000. miles. The peo∣ple of this Realme worship Idols. And in the Mountaynes of this Countrey, there be found fine Adamants. And after they haue had muche rayne, the men goe to séeke them in


the streames that runne from the Mountaynes, and so they do find the Adamants, whiche are brought from the Mountaynes in Sommer when the dayes are long. Also, there be strong Serpents and great, very venemous, sée∣ming that they were serte there to kéepe the Adamantes that they might not be taken away, and in no parte of the world there is found fine Adamants but there. Th
re be in this Countrey the biggest Shéepe in the worlde. And in the Prouince of 
Moabar
 aforenamed, lyeth the body of the Apostle 
Sainct Thomas,
 buryed in a small Citie, whi∣ther there goeth but few Merchants, for that it standeth farre from the Sea. There dwell manye Christians and Moores, hauing great reuerence vnto the body of 
S
inct Thomas,
 for they doe beléeue and say, that he was a Moore, and a great Prophet, and they do call him 
Tho∣mas Dauana,
 which is to say, a holy man. The Christi∣ans that go on Pilgrimage to visit the body of 
Saincte Thomas,
 take of that earth where he was martired, and when any falleth sicke, they doe giue him of it to drinke, with wine and water. In the yeare of our Lorde .1297. it chanced there to be a miracle in this wise: A Knight ga∣thered so much Rice, that he had no place to put it in, but put it into a house of 
Sainct Thomas,
 and the Christian men desired him not to pester the holy Apostles house with his Rice, where the Pilgrims did lodge, yet the Knighte would not heare them, and the same night, the spirite of 
Sainct Thomas
 appeared with a Gallowes of iron in his hande, putting it aboute the Knightes necke, and sayde, If thou cause not thy Rice to be taken out of the house of 
Sainct Thomas,
 I will hang thée. This mi∣racle the Knight told with his owne mouth, vnto all the people of that Countrey, and forthwith the Christians rendred hartie thankes to the holy Apostle, who dothe many miracles on the Christians that committe them∣selues deuoutely vnto him: All the people of this Coun∣trey


be blacke, not bycause they be so borne, but for that they woulde be blacke, they annoynt themselues with a kind of oyle, called oyle of 
Ai
niolly,
 for the blackest are estéemed most fayre. Also, the people of this Countrey cause their Idols to be paynted blacke, and the Diuels to be painted white, saying, that God and his Sainctes are blacke, and the Diuels white. When they of this Coun∣trey go on warfare, they weare hattes vpon their heads, made of the hides of wild Oxen, and vpon their shieldes. And to the féete of their Horses, they fasten the heares of an Oxe, saying, that Oxen heares be holy, and haue thys vertue, that whosoeuer carieth of them aboute him, can receyue no hurt nor danger.

G
Oing from that Towne of 
Sainct Thomas
 towardes the Occidente, you come vnto a Prouince named 
Lahe,
 and there dwell the men named 
Bragmanos,
 which are the truest men in the world. They will not lye for all the worlde, nor yet consent vnto any falsehoode for all the world. They are very chast people, being contented only with one woman or wife. They neuer drinke wine, and by no manner of meanes they will take another mans goodes, nor will eate fleshe, nor kill any kinde of beast for all the world. They do honour the Idols, and haue much vnderstanding in the arte of Fortunes. Before they doe conclude anye greate bargayne, and before they doe anye thing of importance, firste they doe consider theyr shadowe agaynste the Sunne, whereby they iudge the thyng that they muste doe by certayne


rules which they haue deputed for it. They doe eate and drinke temperately. They are neuer let bloud, therefore they be very wise. In this Countrey there be many reli∣gious men, which are named 
Cingnos,
 and liue a hundred and fiftie yeares, for their greate abstinence and good li∣uing. In this Countrey there be also certayne religious men Idolaters, who goe altogither naked, couering no part of their body, saying, that of themselues they be pure and cleane from all sinne. These doe worship the Oxe. These religious men weare eache of them vppon his for∣head an Oxe made in mettall. They do oynt all their bo∣die with an oyntment, which they make with great reue∣rence of the marou of an Oxe. They do neyther eate in dishes, nor vppon trenchers, but vppon the leaues of the Apple trée of Paradise, and other drye leaues, and not gréene by no manner of meanes, for they saye, that the gréene leafe hath life and soule. They do sléepe naked vp∣pon the ground.

Indyaco,

as the Sunne hathe his strength, it woulde séeth it as though it were put in séething or scalding water. There is greate trade of merchandise in this Countrey,
 by rea∣son of the greate gaynes. There is very muche Pepper, and very good cheape. In thys Countrey there be manye and strange Beastes to beholde. There groweth no o∣ther kynde of grayne for sustenance, but Rice. There bée many Phisitions and Astrologers. The men and women are blacke, and go naked, sauing that they do couer theyr priuities.

And when any Shippe commeth thither by force of weather, or otherwise, those of the Countrey robbe hym, saying, that those Shyps come not thither, but to robbe them, and therefore they do earnestly beléeue that it is no sinne to robbe them. Héere be Lyons, and other wylde beastes a great number.

In this Countrey there is plentye of Pepper,

Masculine,
 and the other where there is all women, is named 
Feminine.
 The people of those Ilands are as one. The men go not vnto the wo∣men, nor the women vnto the men, but thrée monethes in the yeare, as to witte, August, September, and Octo∣ber, and these thrée moneths, the men and women are to∣gither, and at the third moneths end, they returne vnto their owne houses, doing the rest of their businesse by thēselues. The children Males tarrie with their mo∣thers vntill they be seauen yeares of age, and then they goe vnto their fathers. In this Ilande there is greate plentye of Amber, by reason of the greate number of Whales that they do take. In thys Iland they are good


fishers, and take greate plentie of fishe, and dr

Here is the stall of Rouers and Pirates, and the Christians buy with a good wil the goods whiche they bring, & haue robbed, for that these Pyrates do not robbe but only the Moores and Paynims, and meddle not with the Christians. When a ship sayleth vnder sayle with a prosperous winde, a whole day, the day following the Pyrates, with inchauntmentes of the Diuel, cause the shippe to haue a contrarie winde, and so take it.

Sandalos
 or Saunders trées, also there is founde greate plentie of Amber. Here is good hunting of wilde beasts, and hauking of foules, and hither come many shippes with Merchaundise. Also there is ve∣ry great plentie of wilde Boares. There was sente from hence vnto the greate 
Cane
 the Iawe of a wilde Boare which wayghed twentie fiue poundes. In some times of the yeare, there is founde in this Ilande a certaine foule named 
Nichas,
 which is so big, that the quill of his wings is of twelue paces long, and he is of suche bignesse and strength, that he with his talents taketh an Elephante, and carrieth him vp into the ayre, and so killeth him, and the Elephant so being dead, he letteth him fal, and leapeth vpon him, and so féedeth at his pleasure.








Of the Iland named Tanguybar, vvhere there be men like Gyants. CHAP. 129.


T
Anguybar
 is an Ilande of great nobility, being tenne thousand myles in compasse, and the people of this countrey are Ido∣latours, and so bigge and grosse, that they séeme like Giants One of them wil bear a burthen as waightie as sixe of our men may beare. They are all black, and go naked without any couer. These men are fearefull to beholde, hauing greate mouthes, and a great redde nose, great eares, and bygge eyes, horrible in sight. The women are filthy and euil fa∣uoured. There is great trade of Merchandise. These peo∣ple are bigge of their bodies, strong, and great fighters, and estéeme not their liues. The wilde beastes of thys I∣land differ much from other wilde beastes of other Ilāds and countries.






Of the things rehearsed. CHAP. 130.


Y
Ou shall vnderstande that all whyche I haue declared of 
India,
 is only of the noble and great prouinces bordering vppon the sea coastes, and I doe beléeue that there was neuer man, Christian, nor Iew, nor Paynim, that hath séene so much of the le∣uaunt parties as I 
Marcus paulus
 haue séene, for I haue séene 
India
 bothe the greate and the lesse, & 
Tartaria,
 wyth other prouinces & Ilands, which are so many, y
t
 the age of one man, yea peraduenture of ij. men, would not suffice to




them all. And now I will declare vnto you of 
India
 the great.






Of Abashya. CHAP. 131.


I
N 
India
 the greate, there is a greate prouince named 
Abashia,
 whych is to say the middle 
India,
 for it standeth be∣twéene 
India
 the greate, and 
India
 the lesse. The king of the prouince is a Christian, and the Christians that be vnder hym carrye two tokens made with a burning yron, from the forheade vnto the pointe of their nose. The great King dwelleth in the middest of the prouince, the Moores dwel towardes the prouince of 
Cadamy.


The holye Apostle 
Saint Thomas
 did conuerte muche people vnto the Christian faith in this prouince, and af∣terwards went from thence vnto the prouince of 
Moaber,
 where he was martyred. In this prouince there be many valiant knights, and mē of armes, and they do euer make war against the 
Souldan
 of 
Aden.
 The people of thys countrey liue vpon fleshe, milke, and Rice, and of no other thing. There they vse muche vsurie, and in this prouince there be many Cities and townes.








Of the prouince of Adem or Ades, and of the things found there. CHAP. 132.


T
He prouince of 
Adem
 hathe a King, and he is named the 
Sowdan
 of 
Ad
m.
 There be in this prouince many Cities and Townes, and the people are Moores, and haue greate strife with the Christians. There be in this prouince Ports and Hauens, whither many shippes come with merchaundize, and the moste of this prouince liue vppon Rice, for that they haue little fleshe, and lesse milke. This country is very dry and without fruite, and there groweth no grasse, and therefore the beastes of this prouince liue vppon drie fishe, salte and rawe, which they doe eate in steade of strawe and barley.






Of a mightie King of the Orient parties. CHAP. 133.


N
Owe I haue tolde you of 
India
 the greate, 
India
 the lesse, and of middle 
India,
 and nowe I haue remayning to tell you of the Coun∣tries whiche are towards Septentrion or the North, where there raygneth a King of the imperiall house of the greate 
Cane.
 These people do wor∣shippe the same Idoll that the 
Tartarians
 doe worshippe, whiche they name 
Nazigay.
 This prouince hathe plaines


and mountaines. There groweth no kinde of sustenaunce nei
her corne nor Rice, and the people liue onelye vppon fleshe and milke of Mares, and no man maketh warre a∣gainste them, nor they againste no manne. Here bée manye Camelles and other beastes, but they are deade. Vppon the Seigniorie of this Kyng there is a Coun∣trey so strong, that no manne maye enter into it, nor yet beaste being bigge, by reason of the straites, lakes, and fountaynes whyche bée there, and for that alwayes there is suche feruent colde, that it is alwayes frozen, and vnto them there can come no shipping. This Countrey is in compasse twelue dayes iorney.






Hovve Armines are boughte, and of other beastes. CHAP. 134.


I
 Will declare vnto you howe in these twelue dayes iourney they doe buy the wilde beasts for to haue theyr skinnes. In euerye place of these twelue dayes iourney there is plentie of habitati∣ons, and there be masties or dogges little lesse than Asses. These masties doe drawe after them a certaine thing made of Woodde, whiche is called 
Slioiala,
 whiche is a sleade, as the Oxen or Horses doe drawe a Carte, sauing it hathe no whéeles as oure Cartes haue, and these Slyoialas or sleddes, are as bigge as twoo menne maye be in it, that is to saye, the Mayster of the maysties or carte, and the Merchaunt that goeth to buy the skinnes. And these masties cease not dra∣wing, excepte it be in some myry place, they sette foure


or sixe masties to drawe, as among vs wée doe sette Oxen or Horses, & when they do come to their iourneys end, the Merchaunt hyreth an other carter with his slead and ma∣sties, for that the firste coulde not endure so muche labor, and so he maketh his twelue dayes iourney, till he come to the mountains where the Armins and skinnes are sold, where they buy them, and afterwa
des they retourne as they came. At the ende of this Countrey there standeth a Kingdome whiche is named the 
Barkland,
 for it is there e∣uer darke, as wee call the Twylight,
 for the Sunne shy∣neth not there, and is not séene. The people of this Coun∣trey haue no King, but liue as beastes without lawe. In this Countrie the men and women are well made of their bodies, although they be somewhat yellowe of coloure. The 
Tartarians
 that border vppon them, doe spoyle them very muche, and when the 
Tartarians
 doe goe to robbe in that darke valley, they ride vppon mares that haue horse or mare coltes following them, for they doubte to come oute that wayes that they were in, by reason of the dark∣nesse and wooddes, and when they come neare vnto the place where they meane to robbe, they doe tye their horse or mare coltes vnto the trées, and ride vppon the mare, and doe their feate, and as they haue done it, they lette their mares goe whither they liste, and the mares goe straighte vnto their horse or mare coltes, where they lefte them tyed vnto the trées. Those in that Countrie, wyth certaine deuises doe take many Armines, and diuers o∣ther wilde beasts, and take the skinnes and dresse them, & make merchaundize. This obscure and darke Coun
rey, ioyneth one parte with 
Ronselande.








Of Rouseland, and of other thinges whiche be founde there. CHAP. 135.


R
Ouselande
 is a greate Prouince to∣wardes 
Trasmontana
 whiche is the North. The people of 
Russia
 are Christians, according to the vse of the Gréekes. Touching the things 
f the holy Church, they are verye simple, 
Rouseland
 is a strong Coun∣trey, and hathe very strong passa∣ges. There be very fayre menne and women, and vnto no man they giue tribute, sauing vnto the King of 
Tartarie
 of the Occident. There is made greate merchaundize of no∣ble furres for apparell. In 
Rouseland
 there be founde ma∣ny mines of siluer, also there is such feruent colde, that the people can scarce liue. This prouince reacheth vnto the Occean Seas towardes the Septentrion, in which Seas there be many Ilandes wherein bréedeth many Gerfaul∣cons, and singular Hawkes.


FINIS.














The Introduction.


F
Or that this treatise which I found in the secōd Booke towards the end, that Maister 
Pogio Flo∣rētine,
 Secretary vnto Pope 
Eugenius
 the fourth wryteth of the varietie or chaunge of fortune, it maketh muche vnto the confirmation and proofe of the things that Maister 
Marcus Paulus
 writeth in h
s Booke, for that by the mouth of two or three (as our Redeemer sayth) there is proued the truth I thoughte good to tran∣slate it out of Eloquent Latine, whiche hee did write it in, and to communicate it into my rude Castilian and natu∣rall tongue, for that ioyntly suche twoo witnesses in thys present worke may make a full, or almoste a sure proofe of some things, for that it hath not bin seene in our 
Europa,
 or that in any auntient writing appeareth, it may be thou∣ghte harde or difficile credence. And the saide 
Pogio
 follo∣weth in this manner, in the ende of his seconde Booke.




I
T séemeth not vnto me a thing straunge from reason, if I decline from the stile that hither∣to I haue vsed in this Booke, declaring of the harde fortune making an ende, counting the diuersities of thinges, wherein the heartes of the Readers finde more taste, and amiable gladnesse, than in those that already I haue written. Notwithstanding that also in the cause I will declare, appeareth plainelye the force of Fortune, in retourning a man vnto 
Italy
 oute of the extreame partes of the worlde of the Orient, after that he had suffered and passed fiue and twentie yeres such greate fortunes, aswell by sea as by lande. The olde Au∣thors do write many things of the 
Indians
 with the com∣mon


fame, of the whiche the certaine knowlege that since we haue hadde, sheweth them to be rather fables than of truth, as it appeareth by the referring of one 
Nicholas
 a 
Venetian,
 that after he had trauailed the intrailes of the 
Indias,
 he came vnto 
Eugenius
 the fourth Pope of that name, who then was in 
Florence,
 to reconcile himselfe, and to haue pardon, for that comming oute of 
India,
 and ne
re vnto 
Egipt
 towards the redde Sea, hée was constrayned to renounce and forsake the faith, for feare of death, more of his wife and children, than of hymselfe. And for that I hearde by manye, that he declared of manye singular things, I desired muche to heare hym, and not onelye to demaunde of him concerning the things whiche hée hadde séene, in the presence of wise Barons, and of greate au∣thoritie, but also to enforme my selfe wyth hym in myne owne house, and to take a note of his relation, for that there mighte remaine a remembraunce of it vnto those that hereafter shoulde come after mée. And of a trueth hée tolde so certaynelye, so wisely, and so attentiuely all hys trauaile made amongest people of so farre Coun∣tries, the vse, manners, and custome of the 
Indians,
 the diuersitie of wilde beastes, trées, the lynages of Spices, and in what place it groweth, that it appeared well, hée dydde not declare a fained tale, but the trueth of that whiche hée hadde séene. And as it séemeth, this man went so farre, as none of the olde tyme hadde béene, for he passed the riuer 
Gangy,
 and wente beyonde the Ilande 
Taprobana,
 where we reade there came none, excepte one Captaine of 
Alexanders
 fléete named 
Onesycrito,
 and a Citizen of 
Rome,
 that by fortune of tēpest arriued in those parties in the time of 
Tiberius Cesar.
 This 
Nicholas Ve∣netian
 being yong, was as a Merchaunt in the Citie of 
Damasco
 in 
Syria,
 and hauing learned the 
Arabian
 tongue, he departed from the sayde Citie in the company of .600. Merchantes, the whiche company they do call 
Carouana,



or 
Carauana,
 & trauailing with his merchaundize through the deserts of 
Arabia,
 otherwise named 
Petrea,
 and from thence thoroughe 
Chaldie,
 he came vnto the greate riuer 
Euphrates.


Hée saide, that at the going out of the Deserte, hée sawe a meruailous thing, that aboute midnighte, being all at reste, he heard a great noise and sound, that they thoughte it hadde bin companies of 
Alarabes
 wild naked menne, or robbers, and that they were comming to doe them some hurte, and all the whole company arose and were al ready with the feare, and they sawe manye battels of horsemen whiche passed harde by their tents much like an hoste, doo∣ing vnto them no hurte at all, and those that hadde vsed that way, said it was certaine companies of fiends which did ouer run in that sorte the Deserts.


There standeth aboue 
Euphrates
 a noble Citie that the walles of it be of fouretéene thousande paces. And this Citie was a parte of the olde 
Babilon,
 and those of that Countrie, name it by a newe name 
Baldachia,
 and 
Euphrates
 runneth in the middes of it, and they doe passe ouer a bridge that hath fourtéene arches of ech side, where appeareth many remembraunces of the olde 
Babilon,
 and manye edifications throwne downe. It hath a strong and a greate Pallaice royall standing vpon a mountaine. The King of this prouince is of a mightie power. From hence vp the riuer twentie dayes sayling, he sawe manye noble and populous, and earable groundes of Ilandes, and so he trauailed eight dayes iourney by lande vnto the Cittie 
Balsera,
 and from thence in foure dayes he came vnto the Sea of 
Persia,
 whiche ebbeth and floweth as ours doeth, and so there saylyng fyue dayes, he arryued at a Hauen called 
Chalcou,
 and from thence hée wente vnto an Iland named 
Omersia,
 whych is a small Iland, & distant from the firme lād about .12000 paces, & frō thēce he passed toward



India
 a hundred myles, and came vnto a Citie named 
Ca∣labatia,
 which is a noble Citie of the 
Persians,
 where mer∣chaunts vse to traffique, and here he was a certaine time, and learned the Persian tongue, and made him apparell as the 
Persians
 had, and so he passed from thence forward al his time and trauell. And here he tooke shipping in a shippe with company of the 
Persians,
 and of the 
Moores,
 & among them they kéepe muche their promise, lawes, and othes made in company, and so sayling a moneth, he came vnto a noble Citie named 
Cambayta,
 situated at the second entraunce that the riuer of 
India
 maketh in the lande. In this Countrie there is founde the pretious stones whiche are called 
Sardins
 or 
Sardonicas
: and here when the hus∣band dieth, they do burne his wife or wiues that he hath, with his body, and she that he most loued, layeth hir neck vppon hir husbandes arme, and in this wise being in hir husbandes armes, they burne them: and the other wiues they burne in an other fire whiche is made for that pur∣pose, and of this vse it shall be rehearsed hereafter. And passing on twentie dayes iourney, he founde two Cities, the one named 
Pacamunria,
 and the other 
Hely.
 In this Countrey there groweth Ginger whiche is called in that countrie 
Bellyedy, Gebelly,
 and 
Belly,
 and it is the roote of trées of two cubites in height, the leaues are great, and after the fashion of a kettle, y
e
 bark is hard like y
e
 barke of Canes, & it couereth his fruit: out of it procéedeth the gin∣ger, which mingled with ashes, & layd against the Sun, it drieth in thrée dayes. From hence he went trauailing frō the sea coaste thrée hundreth myles, and he came vnto the greate Citie named 
Berengalia
 whych, is in compasse thrée score myles, being enuironed on the one side with harde and highe rockes, and on the other side towards the valleys and playne grounde with strong adarnes and boughes. They saye héere is .900000. menne that may weare armoure. The men of that country take


as manye wiues as they lifte, and are burnte with them when they dye. In this their King hath ouer them greate vantage, for he taketh twelue thousād wiues, and of these there goeth on foote after him wheresoeuer he goeth foure thousande, whych do only prepare and dresse his victuals: and there rideth foure thousand on horsebacke, well appa∣relled, and of more estimation than the firste. The other foure thousand ryde in carts and wagons, and of these at the leaste there be two thousand or thrée thousand of them that he taketh with condition, that when the king is dead, they of their owne frée willes muste be burnte wyth him: vnto these they do great seruice and obedience. This king hath another very noble Citie, which hath ten thousande paces in compasse, being eight dayes iourney from 
Beren∣galia,
 from whence in twentie dayes iourney by lande, hée came vnto a Citie vppon the sea coste, with a good hauen called 
Pedifetaman,
 and in these twentie dayes iourney hée went through two Cities, the one named 
Odes Chyria,
 and the other 
Conteri Chyrian,
 where there groweth the redde 
Sandolos
 or Saunders. From hence he passed vnto a Citie named 
Malpurya,
 whiche standeth beyonde the seconde en∣tring, that the riuer 
India
 maketh in y
e
 end, wher the body of 
Saint Thomas
 the Apostle lyeth honourably in a fayre and famous Church, where he is greatlye honoured and worshipped by the Heretickes Nestorians: and there liue almost a thousande men of them in this Citie. These doe liue throughout all 
India
 scattered as the Iewes doe a∣mong vs. All this prouince is named 
Mahabaria,
 beyonde there standeth a Citie named 
Cayla,
 where there be plenty of peares, and many trées that beare no fruite, of sixe Cu∣bits high, and as muche in compasse: the leaues of these trées are so thinne, that being playted or foulded vp, you may put one of them in the palme of your hand. They doe vse these leaues in steade of Paper to write vpon, and for to couer their heades with when it rayneth, for one leafe


will couer thrée or foure men, when they doe trauell. In the middest of this sea there standeth a noble Ilande na∣med 
Zaylan,
 whyche is thrée thousande myles in compasse, where there be many precious stones, as Rubies, Saphi∣res, Granates, and those that are named Cattes eyes, whyche are muche estéemed there. Also there is plentye of Synamon, whiche is a trée muche like vnto oures of the greatest Hawtho
es, sauing that the braunches runne not vpwarde, but open and streight slopewise: the leaues be muche like vnto our Bay leaues, sauing that those of y
e
 Synamon are bigger: the rine or barke of the braunches is best and thinnest, and the rine of the bodye and roote is thickest, and of lesse taste: the fruite is like vnto the Baye berries, out of whych there commeth a very swéete Oyle, and the people vse to make oyntment of it, wherewith the 
Indians
 do annoint themselues: they burne the wood of the trée, when the rine is taken away. There is in this coun∣trey a lake, and in the middest of it standeth a royall Ci∣tie of thrée myles compasse. The Lords of this Iland are of the lynage of the 
Bragmanos,
 and are taken to be of more witte than the others. The 
Bragmanos
 Studie Phylosophy all their life, and also Astrologie, and liue ho∣nestly. From hence he passed vnto the famous Ilande na∣med 
Taprobana,
 which the 
Indians,
 call 
Scyamucera,
 where is a noble Citie, and there he was a twelue month: it is sixe myles in compasse, and is a famous Citie, hauing greate trade of Merchaundise there, and in al that Iland. From hence be sayled with a prosperous winde, leauing on the right hand the Iland 
Adamania,
 which is as much to say, as the Ilande of Colde, whyche is 800. myles compasse, wherein the 
Euitrofagitas
 doe liue, and no straungers goe thyther, except it be for necessity of weather, and immedi∣ately those barbarous people hewe them in péeces, and eate them. He sayde that 
Taprobana
 is 1600000. paces in compasse, the men are verye cruell, and of stubberne con∣ditions,


and the men and women haue very bigge eares, laden with Hoopes of golde, and with precious stones. They do weare linnen and cloth of silke or cruell downe vnto their knées: they take many wiues: their houses are lowe, by reason of the greate heate that the sunne hath there. They are Idolatours, and haue muche Pepper named the greatest, and of the long Pepper, and greate plentie of Camphore and golde. The trée that maketh the pepper is like the 
Yedra,
 or Iuie trée, the berries are gréen lyke vnto the Iuniper berries, and redde, and being min∣gled wyth ashes, they harden with the sunne: there is a gréene fruite named Durians, of the bignesse of Cucum∣bers. And there be some of them lyke Orengies or Lemans, of diuerse sauours and taste, as like butter, lyke milke, and like curdes. In that part of this lande, whiche is named 
Bateth,
 y
e
 
Antropophagos
 dwel, and haue continu∣all warre with their neyghbours, and eate the fleshe of their enimies that they doe take, and kéepe their heades for treasure, and vse them in steade of money, when they do buy anye thing, in giuing moste heades for the thing that is most worth, and he that hath moste heades of the deade men in his kéeping, is estéemed to be most rich.


Hauing the Iland 
Taprobana,
 and sayling fiftéene days, he arriued by tempest of weather, vnto the entring of a riuer called 
Tenaserim,
 and in this region there be manye Elephants, and there groweth much Brasill. And goyng from thence trauelling many dayes iourney by land, and by sea, he entred at the mouth of the Ryuer 
Gangey,
 and say∣led fiftéene dayes vp the riuer, and came vnto a Citie na∣med 
Cernomen,
 very noble and plentiful.


Thys Riuer 
Gangey
 is of suche breadth, that Say∣lyng in the middest, you shall sée no lande on neyther side, and hée affyrmeth that it is in some places fif∣téene myles in breadth. In the armes and braunches of this ryuer there be Canes of suche a maruellous lēgth,


and so bigge, that scarce a manne maye compasse one of them wyth both his armes: and of the hollownesse or pith of them, they do make things to fishe with, and of y
e
 wood which is more than a spanne thick, they do make boates to trauell with vpon the riuer, and from knot to knotte of these Canes it hath of hollownesse the length of a man. There be in this riuer certaine beasts, hauing four féete, named 
Crocodiles,
 which liue in the day time vpon the lād, and in the night in water: and there be many kindes of fishe whiche are not founde among vs, and vppon the braunches of this riuer be manye fayre Gardens, habita∣tions, and delectable grounde. On eche side there groweth a kinde of fruite muche like vnto a figge, whych is named 
Musa,
 and it is verye pleasaunte, and more swéete than honnye. Also there is another fruite, whyche we call Nuttes of 
India,
 and manye other diuerse fruites. Go∣ing from hence vppe the ryuer thrée moneths, leauing be∣hinde him foure famous Cities, he came to a goodlye fa∣mous Citie named 
Maarazia,
 where there is great plen∣ty of the trées called Alloes, and plentie of golde, and sil∣uer, Pearles, and precious stones. And going from hence he directed hys waye vnto the mountaines of the Ori∣ent, for to haue Carbuncles, and trauelling thirtéene dayes, he returned firste to 
Cermon
 and afterwardes vnto 
Buffetanya.


And after that, sayling a whole moneth by sea, he came vnto the entring of the riuer 
Nican,
 and sayling vppon it sixe dayes, he came vnto the Citie also named 
Nican,
 and he went from thence seauentéene dayes iourney throughe deserte mountaynes, and plaine countrey, the fiftéene days of plaine countrey, vntil he came to a riuer greater than the riuer 
Gange,
 which the people of that countrey cal 
Cla∣ua,
 and sayling vp this riuer a month, he came vnto a fa∣mous great Citie called 
Aua,
 being 15. miles in compa
e. This prouince is named of the inhabitauntes 
Marcin
.



They haue greate plenty of Elephantes, for their Kyng dothe kéepe tenne thousande of them for the warres▪ and setteth vpon euery Elephantes backe a Castell, whyche maye carrie eyghte or tenne men with Speares and Shields, or Bowes, or Crossebowes. He rehearsed that they toke the Elephantes in this manner, 
Plinie
 agreeth vnto the like. They let the tame Elephants females goe vnto the mountaynes, vntill suche time as the wilde bee acquainted with them, for the male commonly doth con∣tent himselfe with one female, and when they haue once acquaintance, the female bringeth the wild, by little and little, grasing, vnto a small yard strongly walled, hauyng two dores, one to come in at, and another to goe out at. The female when she is in at the first gate, she goeth out at the seconde, and the male following hir, the two dores be locked againste him, and then hauing him within, by certayne loupe holes made for the purpose, there com∣meth in to the number of a thousand men, euery one with his snare in his hande, and one of those men presenteth himselfe before the Elephant, which runneth, thinking to kill the man, and then all those men runne vnto the Ele∣phant, fastning those snares on his féete, and whē they be fastned, with great diligence, they do tye the snares vnto a great post, which is set there for that purpose, and they let him alone so thrée or four dayes, till he be more feeble, and after the space of fiftéene dayes, they giue him a little grasse, in the whiche time he wareth tame, and then they do tye him among other tame Elephants, and carrie him aboute the Citie, and in tenne dayes he becommeth as gentle as one of the others. Also he sayde, they did tame them in this other wise, that they had and dra
e them vnto a valley compassed round about, where they did put vnto them the females that were tame, and being some∣what féeble with hunger, they draue them into strayter places made for the nonce, where they be made tame,


and these the Kings do buy for their owne vse. Some are fedde with Rice, and Butter, and some with grasse. The wilde Elephantes féede vpon grasse, and vpon the trées of the fields. He that hathe charge of them, rul
th them with a rodde of yron, or a ring whiche he putteth round about his head. The Elephants haue so much pro∣uidence, that manye with their féete, pull away the Speares from their enimies, for that they shoulde not hurt those that be vpon their backes. The King rideth vpon a white Elephant, which hath a chayne of golde a∣bout his necke, being long vnto his féete, set full of many precious stones. The men of this Countrey haue but one wife a péece. Both men and women of this Countrey pricke themselues, making diuers markes, and of diuers couloures, on theyr bodyes. They be all Idolaters, and assoone as they do rise in the morning, they looke into the Orient, holding their hāds togither, and worship. There is in that Countrey a certayne kinde of fruite, like vnto the Orenge, whiche they doe call 
Cyeno,
 full of iuice and swéetenesse. Also, there is a trée whiche they doe call 
Tall,
 whereon they do write, for in all 
India,
 except it bée in the Citie of 
Combahita,
 they doe vse no paper, and it beareth a fruite like vnto the Turnep, but they are greate and ten∣der like vnto Gelly. It is pleasant in eating, but the ryne is more pleasant. There be in that Countrey daunge∣rous Serpents, of sixe cubites in length, and as thicke as a man, hauing no féete. The people of that Country haue great delight in eating of those Serpēts rosted. Also they do eate a certayne redde Ante as bigge as a crabbe, estée∣ming it much drest with Pepper. Also, there is a certaine Beast, hauing a head like vnto a Hogge, the tayle lyke vnto an Oxe, and a horne in his forehead, like vnto a V∣nicorne, but smaller by a cubite. He is couloure and bignesse like vnto the Elephante. He is an enimie to the Elephant. The vtter part of his hornes is good for medi∣cines


against poyson, and for this cause he is had in great price and estimation. At the end of this Region towards 
Catay,
 there be Oren both blacke and white, had in great estimation. They haue a mane and a tayle lyke vnto a Horse, but more hearie, and reacheth vnto their féete. The heares of their tailes be very fine, and like vnto feathers, and they be sold by weight, and therof they do make Mos∣caderos or Table clothes, for the Altares of their Gods, or for to couer the Table of their King, or for to trimme them with gold and siluer, to couer y
e
 buttocks or breasts of their Horses, for beautyfulnesse, & they estéeme thē for principall ornaments. Also, the Knightes hang of these heares fast by the yron of their Speares, in token among them of singular nobilite.


Beyond the sayde 
Marcino,
 there is another Prouince more principall than the others, which is named 
Cataya,
 and he is Lord of it that is named the great 
Cane,
 whych is as muche to saye in their tong, as Emperoure,
 and the City royall, which is .28. miles in compasse, four square, is named 
Cymbalechya.
 There standeth in the middest thereof, a very faire and strong Pallace, that serueth for the King. At euery corner standeth a round fortresse of .4. miles compasse, whiche serue for houses of all manner of armoure, and necessarie engines for the warre, and com∣bat against any Citie. And from the Pallace royall there runneth a wall with arches vnto euery one of these for∣tresses, whereon the King may go vnto any of them, if in case they would rise against him in the Citie. From thys Citie fiftéene dayes iourney, there standeth another Ci∣tie newly edifyed by the great 
Cane,
 and is named 
Nen∣tay.
 It is in compasse thirtie miles, and is most populous of all the rest. And this 
Nicholas
 affirmeth, that the hou∣ses and Pallaces, and all other policies of these two Ci∣ties, séemed much like vnto those of 
Italy,
 the men béeing modest and curteous, and of more riches thā the other be.


Going from 
Aua
 vpon a small riuer seauentene dayes iourney, he came vnto a Hauen Citie, being very greate, named 
Zeitano,
 and from thence he entred into another Riuer: and in tenne dayes, he came vnto another greate and populous Citie, whiche is in comapasse .12000. paces, whiche is called 
Paconya,
 where he remayned foure mo∣nethes. In this Citie he founde Vines though they were few, for all 
India
 lacketh Vines and Wine, nor they make no wine of the Grapes. This Grape groweth a∣mong the trées, and after the Grape is cut, the first thing of all, if they do not sacrifice with it vnto their Gods, it is by and by auoyded out of their sight. Also, there be in this Countrey Pines, Aberrycocks, Chestnuttes, and Mel∣lons, although they be small and gréene. Héere is whyte Sandales or Saunders, and Camphora, or Camphire.


There is in 
India
 farre within, almost at the furthest end of the world, two Ilandes, and both of them are na∣med 
Laua,
 the one is of two miles in length, and the other of thrée, towards the Orient, and they are knowen in the name, for the one is called the greate, and the other the lesse. And turning vnto the Sea, he went vnto them, bée∣ing distant from the mayne land a monethes sayling, and the one is a hundred miles distāt from the other. He was in these with his wife and children nine moneths, for in all his pilgrimage he had them euer with him. The dwellers in these Ilands are the most cruell and vncha∣ritable people in the world. They eate Rattes, Cattes, Dogges, and other viler beastes. They estéeme it no∣thing to kill a man, and he that doth any crime, hathe no penaltie, and the debters be giuen to be as slaues vnto the creditors, and some debters will rather dye than serue, and take a Sword, and kill those that are weaker than they, till they find one that is of more strength than themselfe, who killeth them, & then they carrie the credi∣tor of that murtherer before the Iudge, and cause him to


pay the debtes of the debler. If any of them do buy a new Sword or knife, he proueth it vpon the body of the firste that he méeteth, and there is no penaltie for it. Those that come by looke vpon the wound, and prayse the hardi∣nesse of him that did it, if it be a great wound. They take as many wiues as they list. They do vse much the game of Cockfighting, and they that bring them as well as the lokers on, lay wagers whiche Cocke shall ouercome, and winne the game. In 
Laua
 the great, there is a Fowle like vnto a Doue, which hath no féete, his feathers light, and a long tayle: he resteth alwayes on the trées, hys flesh is not eaten, the skinne and tayle are estéemed, for they do vse to weare them on their heads.


Sayling fiftéene dayes beyond these two Ilandes to∣wards the Orient, you come vnto two other Ilands, the one is named 
Sanday,
 where there is Nutmegges and 
Al¦maxiga
 or Masticke. The other is called 
Bandan,
 where Cloues grow, and from thence it is caryed vnto the I∣lands named 
Clauas.
 In 
Bandan
 there be thrée kinds of Po∣piniayes or Parrets, with redde feathers, and yellowe billes, and others of diuers couloures, whiche are called 
Noros,
 that is to say, cleare. They are as bigge as doues. There be other white ones as bigge as Hennes, named 
Cachos,
 that is to say, better, for they excéede the others, and they speake like men, in so muche, that they doe aun∣swere vnto the things that they are asked of. The people of these two Ilandes are blacke, by reason of the greate heate. Beyond these Ilands there is a mayne Sea, but the contrary winds will not suffer men to trauell on it.


Leauing these sayde Ilands, and hauing done his Merchandise, he toke his waye towards the Occidente or Weste, and came vnto a Citie named 
Cyampa,
 hauing abundaunce of Aloes and of 
Camphora,
 or Camphire, and of golde, and in so muche time as he came hither, whiche was a moneth, he came vnto a Citie named



Coloen,
 whiche is a noble Citie of thrée miles compasse, where there is Ginger named 
Conbobo,
 and Pepper, and Vergino, and Sinamon, which is named 
Gruessa.
 Thys Prouince is named 
Melibarya.
 Also, there be Serpents of sixe cubites in length, and fearefull to behold, but they do no hurt, except they receyue hurt. They do delight muche to sée children, and for to sée them, they come where men be. Their heads when they be layde, séeme like to Celes heads, and when he lifteth vp his head, it séemeth bigger. It hath at the hinder partes a face like to a man and as though it were paynted of diuers couloures. They doe take them by inchantments, which the people vse muche there, and carrie them to be séene, and doe no hurt to anye body. Also, there is in this Prouince, and in the nexte ad∣ioyning named 
Susynaria,
 another kind of Serpēts, which hath foure féete, and a long tayle lyke mastyes. They doe take them hunting, and eate them, for they doe no hurte, and are to eate as amongst vs the Hinde or wilde Goate. The people say they are good meate. Their Skinnes be of diuers couloures, and those people vse them for diuers couerings, for it is very fayre to behold. Also, there be o∣ther Serpentes of a maruellous figure in that Countrey, of y
e
 length of one cubite, with wings like vnto Battes. They haue seauen heads, ordinarily sette of the length of his bodye. They dwell among the trées, and are of a swifte flighte. The yare more venomous than the other, that onely with their breath they kill a man. Also, there be Cattes of the Mountayne, that flye, for they haue a small skinne from the backe vnto the bellie, ouer all theyr body and féete, whyche is gathered vp when they are still: and when they will flye, they spredde it, and moue it lyke wings, leaping from one trée vnto another. The Hunters do follow them, till they be wéerie with flying, that they fall downe, and so are taken. Also, there is in this Countrey a trée named 
Cachy,
 that of the troncheon


there groweth a fruite lyke vnto a Pyne, but it is so great, that a man can scarce beare it. The hull is gréene and harde, but it is of suche a sorte, that if you thrust it with your finger, it gyueth place. It hath within it two hundred and fiftie, or thrée hundred Apples, like vn∣to Figges. They are of a pleasante tast, and are separa∣ted with a very thinne rine. The hull within is like vnto the Chestnut in hardnesse and sauoure, and in like maner they are rosted. They are windie, so that if they be putte into the fire, except they be cut, they will start out. They do giue the vtter rine vnto the Oxen to eate. Sometimes they fynde this fruite vnder grounde in the rootes of the trées, and those be of a pleasanter tast, therefore they doe vse to presente them vnto the Kings and Nobles. The fruite within hath no rine. This trée is muche like vnto a great Figge trée: the leaues are like vnto the leaues of 
Platanos,
 or ragged. The wodde is like vnto Bore, there∣fore it is hadde in estimation, and is vsed aboute manye things. Also, there is another fruite named 
Amba,
 verye gréene, like vnto a Walnut, but bigger than a Peache. The rine is bitter, and within, it hath the sauour of hony. They lay them in water before they ripe, and dresse them as we doe the gréene Olyues for to eate.


From 
Coloen
 he wente thrée dayes iourney vnto a Ci∣tie named 
Cochin,
 it is fiue myles in compasse, scituated at the entring of a Riuer, of the whiche it hath the name, and sayling a certayne time vpon the Riuer: he saw ma∣nye fiers and nettes fast by the Riuer, and thought there had bin fishermen, and he demaunded what those fisher∣men did with those fires euery nighte, and those of that Coūtrey gaue him answere 
yeepe, yeepe,
 that is to say, they were fishes or monsters, hauing humane forme, that on the daye time liued in the water, and in the night they doe come out of the water, and gather wodde togi∣ther, and make a fyre, striking one stone agaynste


another, whiche Monsters did take and eate fishe, for there woulde come manye vnto the lighte of the fire, and sometimes there is taken some of them, and there is found no difference in them from other men and women. In this Region, the frutes are like vnto those of 
Col
en.
 Beyond this, there standeth another Citie named 
Calon∣guria,
 standing at the entring of another Riuer into the Sea, and beyond, there standeth 
Paluria,
 and 
Malyancora,
 and this name among them signifyeth a great Citie, it is nine miles in compasse. He wente through all those, and came vnto 
Colychachia,
 a City standing vpon the Sea coaste, it is eyght miles in compasse, it is the most noble in trade of Merchandise, that is in all 
India.


There is héere very much Pepper, Laccar, Ginger, grosse Sinamon, and other spices Aromatike, and of a swéete sauoure. Only in this region, the woman taketh as many husbands as she listeth, and the husbands agrée among themselues what eache shall giue towardes the mayntenance of the wife. Euery husband is in his owne house, and when he goeth vnto his wife, he setteth a signe at the dore, and when another of them commeth, and séeth the signe, he goeth another way. The children are the husbands that the wife listeth to giue them vnto. The sonne dothe not inherit his fathers lande, but hys sonnes sonne.


From hence he trauelled 
iftéene dayes, tyll hée came to a Citie called 
Cambayta,
 standing néere the Sea. It is twelue miles in compasse towardes the Occidente. There is plentye of Espico, Nardo, or Lacca Indico, or Gome Laka, Myrabolanos, & Crewill.


There is héere a certayne kind of Priestes, whiche are named 
Bachales,
 hauing but one wife a péece, and she (by their law) is burnt with hir husband. This kind of peo∣ple eateth no flesh, but onely fruites of the grounde, and Rice, milke and hearbes.


Here be many wilde Oxen, they haue manes like vnto Horses, but longer, and his hornes are so long, that when he turneth his heade they reache vnto his tayle, and for that they be so bigge, they doe vse them in steade of bot∣tels to drinke in by the waye. Returning to 
Colicuchia,
 hée passed vnto an Iland named 
Secutera,
 whiche standeth to∣wards the Occident, distant from the mayne lande a hun∣dreth myles. It is sixe hundreth myles in compasse, and it is replenished for the most parte with Christians Nesto∣rians Heretickes. Right against this Iland no more thā fiue myles, there standeth two Ilands, a thousande myles distant the one from the other, the one is of men, the other of women, sometimes the men passe vnto the women, and sometimes the women go ouer vnto the men, and they re∣turne backe vnto their Ilande before sixe moneths, for if they shoulde tarrie any longer, they thinke shoulde dye.


From hence he passed by sea, vnto a Citie named 
Ade∣na
 in fiue days, which hath many edifications, and from thence in seauen dayes he wente vnto 
Ethiopia,
 vnto a ha∣uen named 
Barbara,
 and from thence in a monthes sayling he came vnto the redde sea, vnto a hauen called 
Byonda,
 and from thence he sayled two monthes with great difficultie, and landed in a countrey neare vnto mounte 
Sinay,
 & from thence trauelling through the deserts, he came vnto 
Car∣ras,
 a Citie in 
Egipt
 with his wife, foure sonnes, and as many seruaunts. In this Citie his wife, two sonnes, and his seruauntes died of the plague, and finallye after long perilous and daungerous pilgrimages, he came vnto 
Ve∣nice,
 his own countrey.




Pogio.


I
 Demaunding him of the life and cu∣stomes of the 
Indians,
 he gaue me aun∣sweare that all 
India
 was diuided into thrée parts, the one from 
Persia
 vnto the riuer 
Indo,
 another from the riuer 
Indo,
 vnto the riuer 
Gange,
 and the other stā∣deth beyond these, and excéedeth the o∣thers in riches, humanitie, and pollicie, and are equal vnto vs in customes, life, and pollicie, for they haue sumptuous and neate houses▪ and all their vessels and housholde stuffe very cleane: they estéeme to liue as noble people, auoyded of all villanie and crueltie, being courteous people & riche Merchauntes, in so muche that there is one merchaunte hauing fortie shippes for his owne trade, and euery one of them is estéemed in 50000. Duckets. These only vse as we do, tables couered with table clothes, and haue theyr Cupboardes of plate, for the other 
Indians
 eate vppon a thing layde vppon the grounde. The 
Indians
 haue neyther vines nor Wine, they doe make their drinke of grounde Rice mingled with water, putting vnto it a certaine redde coloure all tempered with the iuyce of a certayne trée.


Also they make their pottage like vnto their Wine. In the Ilande named 
Taprobana
 they doe cutte the braun∣ches of a certaine trée, whiche is named 
Tall,
 and leaue them hanging, and out of them there runneth a swéete li∣cour whiche they vse to drinke. Also there is a lake betwéene the riuers 
Indo
 and 
Gange,
 of a maruellous saue∣rie and pleasaunt water to drinke, and al those that dwell there about drink of it, and also farre off, for they haue set


horse from place to place, 
or the purpose, so that they haue it brought fresh euery daye: they haue all want of breade: they liue vppon Farre or Rice, fleshe, milke, and chéese. They haue gret plentie of Hennes, Capons, Partridges, Feysauntes, and manye other wildefoules. They doe vse much fowling and hunting. They shaue their beardes, and nourishe a Heare tayle: and some tye their haire wyth a silken lace, behinde their shoulders, like a tayle, and so they weare them vnto the warres. They haue Barbars as we haue, they are tall of bodye as we be, and also in their time of life, they doe lye in sumptuous beddes, and couered with quilles of Cotten. Their apparell is diuerse according vnto the diuersitie of the countrey. They haue all scante of woollen cloth, they do vse cloth of lyne and of cruell, and make apparell of it. As well the men as the women couer their secréetes vnto their hammes, with a péece of linnen, & vpon it they put a vesture of linnen, or of silke, for the greate heate will not suffer them to weare more apparell, and therefore they doe goe so single tyed with Crimson lace, and of gold tyed as we do sée the pain∣ters make on the auntient pictures. The women vse cer∣taine thinne shoes of leather, trimmed wyth Golde and cruell.


Also they doe weare for gallauntnesse Hoopes of golde on their armes, and about their neckes, about their breastes, and on their legges, the waight of thrée pounde set with precious stones: the common women kepe theyr houses as baudes: there be manye and easie to finde, for they are almost in euery stréet, the which with perfumes and soft oyntmentes, with their tender age and beautie prouoke muche the menne, for in that countrey they are muche inclyned vnto those women, and for thys cause the 
Indians
 knowe not what thyng is that abhominable sinne. Of manye wayes they doe dresse theyr heades, but commonlye moste of them vse to couer their


heades with fine lawnes wrea
hed, and their haire laced with a silken lace: in some other p
aces they binde theyr haire vp to their heades, in manner like vnto a peare, and on the knot aboue on their haire they set a pinn
 of golde, whereby they do hang certaine cordes of golde, being of diuerse colours, hanging betwéene the haires. Some wo∣men vse commonly blacke haire, and among them it is most estéemed. Some women couer theyr heades wyth certaine painted leaues of trées, and they doe not paynte their faces, but those inhabiting the prouince named 
Ca∣taya
 doe.


In the 
India
 within, they do not consent to a man to haue but one wife. In the others they haue as manye as their carnall lust wil, sauing the Christian Hereticke N
∣storians, which dwel scattered throughout all the 
Indias,
 for they take but one woman. The maner of their tombes is not as one in all the 
Indias,
 for the moste 
India
 excéedeth other, in diligence and sumptuousnesse, for they doe make caues vnder grounde, in trimming it with a fine wal, and laye in the deade body in a precious bedde, trimmed wyth Ornaments of Golde, setting certaine baskettes round a∣bout wyth his moste precious apparell, and put on rings, as though the deade bodye shoulde enioye those things in Hell. They close the mouth of the caue very strongly, that none may enter, and vpon it they do make a sumptuous and rich tombe strong to abide rayne, and to be the more durable: but in the middle 
India
 they doe burne the deade bodies, and most commonly they do burne their wiues a∣lyue with the deade body, one or manye, according as hée had.


They doe by law burn the first wife with him, although it be but one. Also they doe take other wiues on this con∣dition, for to honoure him in death, burning hir selfe with him: and this among them is no little honour. They do laye the deade bodie in a bedde trimmed with the beste


apparell that he hath. They do make a fyre rounde about with swéete wood, and when it burneth, his wife is trunly drest with hir beste aray, and comming with Trumpets and Shawmes and songs merily, as thoughe she did sing, she goeth rounde about the fire. At this there is presente the Prieste, whiche they name 
Bachale
 in a Pulpit, prea∣ching vnto hir howe she muste not estéeme the life nor death, saying, that she shall haue in the other worlde with hir husband muche pleasure, and shall possesse greate ri∣ches, honour and apparell: she inflamed with those words that he telleth hir, after that she hath gone a certaine time rounde about the fire, shée standeth nigher the Priestes Chayre or Pulpit, and putteth off all hir apparell, & put∣teth on a white linnen shéete, and leapeth into the fyre. If some of them be fearefull (for they haue séene the lyke of some) that lamenteth and striueth with death, after that she hath leapte in, then the standers by doe throwe hir in wheather shée will or no. After they be burnte, they ga∣ther the ashes, and putte them into pottes, and some into the graue.


¶ They doe wéepe for the deade after diuers manners. The inner 
Indians
 couer theyr heades with a sacke, and some putte boughes of trées in the highe wayes, and doe hang from the toppe to the grounde painted verses, play∣ing thrée daies vpon certain instrumēts of Copper. They do giue vnto the poore for Gods sake. Other do wéep thrée dayes for the deade, and all the kinsfolkes and neighbors goe vnto the deade bodies house, and they doe carry victu∣alles, but it is not dreste in the dead mans house. In these thrée dayes, those that haue buried their father or mother, do carry a bitter leafe in their mouth, and in a whole yere after they doe not chaunge their apparell, nor eate not but once a day, nor yet cutte theyr nailes, nor haire of their heade or bearde. The women which wéepe for the dead, are many, they stande neare vnto the deade bodies bedde,


being naked vnto the nauell, and strike theyr breastes wyth a loude voyce, saying, alacke, alacke: and one of them beginneth to praise vertues of the deade bodye, and all the reste aunswered vnto hir wordes, striking theyr breasts: some put in certaine vessels of gold, and of si
uer. The ashes of their Prince they cause to be cast into a lake that they haue, saying, it is hallowed by their Goddes, and that that waye they goe downe vnto their Gods. The Priestes whyche they doe call 
Bachales,
 eate of no kinde of beastes, especially not of the Oxe, for they will neither eate, nor kill him, saying, he is verye profita∣ble vnto menne aboue al beastes. They doe eate Rice, hearbes, fruites, and such like, and haue but one wife, whiche is borne with hir husbande when he dyeth, laying hir armes aboute his necke, receyuing hir death with so so good a wil, that she sheweth no signe of paine. Through out al 
India
 there is founde a lynage of Philosophers na∣med 
Bramanos,
 whiche studye Astrologie, and progno∣sticate things to come. They are apparelled more ho∣nestly, and liue more holily than the others. 
Nicholas
 saide,
 that he hadde séene amongest these men, some of .300 yeares, and among them it was hadde for a miracle, for wheresoeuer that man wente, the boyes woulde followe hym, as a thing of noueltie: and among them is muche v∣sed the superstition whyche they doe call 
Geomancia,
 by the whiche they tell thinges to come, as thoughe they were present. Also they are gyuen vnto inchaunte∣mentes, so that dyuers tymes they doe moue and cause t
mpestes to cease, and for this cause manye do eate in se∣cret, for that they should be enchaunted by those that looke vppon them.


¶ The saide 
Nicholas
 dydde tell for a trueth, that hée béeyng patrone and owner of a Shyppe, hée hadde a calme seauen dayes, and hys marriners fearyng, they wente all vnto the mayne maste, and sette vppe a Table, and


after they had made their sacrifices vppon it, they leapte and daunced rounde aboute, calling manye times the name of their Gods, whyche they name 
Mutia
: and a∣mong these there entred a Féend in a Alarabe or Moore, whyche was amongest them, he beganne to sing maruel∣louslye, running aboute the Shippe lyke a madde man, and afterwardes he came vnto the Table, and dydde eate vppe all the meate vnto the bones and fire. Also hée didde demaunde a Cocke, and killed it, and drunke vp the bloude, and immediatelye hée demaunded of those of the Shippe, what they woulde haue that hée shoulde doe, and they demaunded that he shoulde gyue them wind, he promised to giue it them within thrée dayes, and suche, that they shoulde come vnto harborowe: and he shewed, setting his handes behinde, from whence the wind should come, and willed them to prepare for the strength that the winde woulde bring: and when he hadde thus saide, the manne fell downe as halfe deade, without anye knowlege or remembraunce of anye thing that he hadde saide, and in fewe dayes after they were sette in harborowe. Com∣monly the 
Indians
 sayle by the guiding of the Starres of the Pole Antartique, for seldome times they doe sée oure North Starre. They vse not the Loademans stone as wée doe: they doe measure their waye, and distaunce of places, according as their Poale riseth and falleth, and so they doe knowe by this meanes, what place they are in.
 They doe make bigger Shippes than wée doe, that is to saye, of twoo thousande Tunnes, wyth fyue sayles, and so manye mastes: they builde their Shippes wyth thrée plancke
 one vppon another vnder water, that they maye the better resiste the tempestes, for there chaunceth many. These Shippes are made with Chambers, after suche a sorte, that if one of them shoulde breake, the o∣thers maye goe and finish the voyage. Throughout al 
India
 they doe worshippe Idolles, and haue Churches


muche like vnto oures, painted within with diuers pi∣ctures, whiche they doe decke with floures at their feasts. They haue within Idolles of stone, and gold, of siluer, and of Iuorie, some of .60. foote in height. They haue among themselues diuers manners in worshipping, and sacrifi∣zing. When they enter into the Church, they wash them∣selues in cleane water, and so they go in the morning, and in the afternoone, they go in lying along vpon the ground, lifting vppe their féete and handes, and so praye a whyle, then they doe kisse the grounde, and sense their Idolles with the smoake of swéete woodde. On this side of 
Gange
 the 
Indians
 vse no belles, but in steade of them, they doe strike vppon a vessell of Copper, and with an other vessel they doe offer victualles vnto their Gods as the Gentiles did, and afterwarde doe imparte it to the poore, that they maye eate it.


¶ In the Cittie whiche they name 
Cambayta
 the Prie∣stes preache vnto the people in presence of the Idoll their God, declaring howe they shoulde worshippe him, & howe much it pleaseth their Gods, when they do kill themselues for their loue: and there stande in presence many that de∣termine to kill themselues for them. They haue a hoope of Iron aboute their neckes, the vtter parte of the hoope is rounde, and within, it is sharpe like vnto a Rasar: also they doe hang vnto the fore parte of the hoope down theyr breaste a chaine, and being sette downe, they fasten theyr féete vnto it, and béeyng thus, as the Prieste sayeth cer∣taine wordes, they stretch forth their legges; and lifte vp their heades, and thus with the sharpenesse of the hoope, cutte off their heades in sacrifice of their Idoll, yéelding vppe their liues. And they that kill themselues in this or∣der, are estéemed as Saints. In the Citie of 
Bizenegalia
 in certaine time of the yeare, they doe carry about the Cittie in procession their Idoll betwéene two cartes, in the com∣pany


of muche people, and the Damoysellesride in cartes in trimme aray, singing in the praise of hym with muche solempnitie, and manye induced by the strength of theyr faith, do lay themselues vpon the ground, that the whéeles of the cartes may goe ouer them, to bruse their bones, and so to dye, saying, that that death is acceptable vnto theyr God. Others there be, that for the better adorning of the carts, make holes throgh the sides of their bodies, putting a rope throughe it, and tye themselues vnto the carte, and so hanging dead in the procession, accompany theyr Idoll, thinking that they cannot doe greater worshippe nor sa∣crifice vnto their Gods. And they make their solempnity thrée times in a yeare. In one time there gather togither all the menne and women, and people of all ages, washing themselues in the sea, or in a riuer, hauing all newe appa∣rell, doyng nothing else in thrée dayes but feaste, daunce, and sing. Another feaste they celebrate in burning manye lampes within and withoute their Churches, burning with oyle of 
Ioni
lly,
 and the light goeth not oute daye nor nighte. In the thirde, they doe sette vppe poales like small mastes through all the stréetes, and from the toppe vnto the grounde, they doe hang very faire clothes, wroughte with golde, belonging vnto their Gods and painted, and on the topped of these poales, al the whole nine dayes that it endureth, they do sette a religious man that hathe a be∣nigne and méeke face, who suffereth all that paine for to receiue the grace of his God, and the people throwe vnto him Orrenges, Lemmons, and other like fruites, and he suffereth it all with patience There bée other thrée so∣lempne dayes, that they doe caste Saffron water vppon those that passe throughe the stréetes, and manye laughe at it. They doe celebrate their weddings wyth banquets, songs, trumpets, and instrumentes muche like vnto ours, sauing Organs whiche they haue not: they doe make ve∣ry sumptuous feasts day and nighte, with instrumentes,


daunces, and songs. They daunce rounde aboute as wée doe, following one after an other in order, and twoo of them carrying twoo painted wandes in their handes, and as they doe méete, they doe chaunge stickes or wandes. And 
Nicholas
 rehearseth, that this was a fayre sighte to beholde. They doe vse no Bathes, sauing the 
Indians
 beyonde 
Gange.
 The others doe washe themselues manye times of the daye with colde water: they haue scant of oile, and other fruites of ours, as Peaches, Peares, Cher∣ries, Damsons, Apples, and of Grapes they haue but fewe, and (as aboue is rehearsed) onely in one place. And in 
Puditfetamas,
 a prouince, there groweth a certaine trée withoute fruite, it groweth thrée cubites aboue grounde, and they call it shamefulnesse, for when a man commeth vnto it, it incloseth the braunches, and when he goeth a∣way, it spreadeth abroade his braunches.


¶ 
Birengalia
 is a Mountaine whiche standeth beyonde towards the Septentrion fiftéene dayes iorney. It is en∣uironed with many lakes, named 
Birenegalias,
 whiche are full of venomous beastes, and the mountaine standeth daungerous to bée entred, by reason of Serpentes. And thereon growe the Adamantes: and for that menne dare not goe vnto it, the pollicie of manne founde a way to en∣ter, and to take the Adamantes, for there standeth adioy∣ning vnto it an other mountaine, being a little higher, and in certaine times of the yeare menne goe vppe vnto the toppe of it, where they doe kill certaine Oxen that they carrye with them, and the péeces of fleshe being hotte and bloudy, with certaine Crossebowes for the purpose, doe shoote them vppon the toppe of that other mountaine, and with the fall, it cleaueth faste vnto the Adamantes, and then the Bitturs and Eagles that flye in the ayre, snatche vppe that fleshe with their clawes or tallants, and flye vnto other places, where they maye féede vppon it without feare of those Serpentes, and so the men finde


the stones that fall from the fleshe: they doe fynde wyth more ease the pretious stones, for they doe digge in sundrye places, where they vse to finde suche stone, so déepe, til they fynde water mingled wyth grauell, and then they doe take a syne for that purpose, and putte in of the grauell, and the water runneth out, and kéepe the stones that remaine behind, and after this sorte in al these parties they doe vse to finde them: and the Maisters that sette to séeke them, haue greate care that their seruauntes doe not steale of those stones, for they haue those that search all their apparell, yea, and so neare, that they leaue not vnsearched their priuie partes, to knowe if they haue hidden any. They diuide 
he yeare into twelue mo∣neths as we doe, and counte the moneths according to the twelue signes of the Elements. They accompte the yeare in diuers manners, and the moste parte doe recken it from August, for that in the time of 
Augustus Octauius Caesar
 there was an vniuersall peace throughoute all the world, and they recken from that time .1490. yeares. In some regions they haue no money, but vse in steade of money a certayne small stone whiche they name Cattes eye, and in some other places they do vse péeces of Iron like néedles, somewhat bigger. In other places they do vse the Kings name written in paper in steade of money. In some pro∣uinces of 
India
 more within the lande, they doe vse 
Venice
 duckets of golde, and also other mony of two duchettes in one. Also they do vse money of siluer, and of copper, and in other places they doe make certaine péeces of golde, and vse them in steade of money. The firste 
Indians
 in the warres vse dartes, & swords, a defence for their armes like Almaine riuets, rounde Targes, and bowes. The o∣ther 
Indians
 vse skulles, backes, and breaste plates. The 
Indians
 which are beyond, vse Crossebowes and gunnes, & al other ingenious artillerie vsed against Cities. These


those of the Weaste frée, and saye, that all other people are blinde, sauing they, whiche haue twoo eyes, and saye that we haue but one, signifying, that in prudence they do excéede all the worlde. And onelye the 
Cambay
as
 write in paper, and all the reste write vppon leaues of trées, and of them make Bookes of a good liking: nor yet they write not as we doe, nor as the Iewes from one side vnto an o∣ther, but begin aboue, and so write downewardes. There be among the 
Indians
 diuers languages. They haue gret abundaunce of slaues. The debtor that can not paye, they cause him to serue the creditor, & he that is accused of any crime, there being no certaine witnesse againste him, is quitte by his oth: they vse thrée manner of othes. There commeth the partie before hys Idoll, and sweareth by that Idoll, that he is not faultie, and they haue readye a hotte burnyng Iron like vnto a fishe hooke, and cause hym that swore, to touch it with his tongue, and to licke it, and if it doe him no hurte, he is quitte. And others bring the partie before hys Idoll, and cause hym to take that same burning yron in his hande, and so to carry it certaine pa∣ces, and if it hurt him not, he is quitte, but if it doe, he is guiltie. The thirde manner of swearing, whiche is moste vsed. is suche: They doe sette before his Idoll, a potte full of hote melted butter, and he that sweareth not to be guil∣tie, dippeth in two of his fingers into the butter, and so wrappeth them with a clowte, and sealeth it, that it shall not vnloose, and at thrée dayes ende they vndoe it, and if there be founde any signe of burning, hée is guiltie, if not, he is quytte. There is no pestilence in the 
Indias,
 nor yet other of the diseases that vse to trouble oure regions, and for this cause there is more Townes and people than is to be beléeued. There be manye that make hostes of a million of menne, whych is .1000000. 
Nicholas
 declared,


that of one to
e, there went out against another tow
 great hosts, and had battayle, and when the one had ouer∣come the other, for a great triumph, they did bring twelue Cart loades of gold laces, and of silke, with the whych the men that remayned deade, had tyed theyr locke hayres, that hanged downe vpon their backes. He sayd more, that sometimes he had gone to their wars, only for to sée both parties, and they dyd not hurt hym, for that they knew hé
 was a straunger.


In an Iland named 
Laua
 the great, is founde in a fewe places a trée, that hath in the middest of the harte a rodd
 of yron, very small, but so long as the hart goeth, and hée that hath of this yron next vnto his flesh, shall not perishe by no kinde of yron, and for this cause there be many that cut their skinnes and put a péece of it betwéene the skinne and the flesh, it is much estéemed.


The things that of the byrde 
Phoenix
 be declared and written in verses by 
Latancio,
 séeme not to be fables, for the sayde 
Nicholas
 doeth say, that at the end of 
India,
 there is only one byrde named 
Seuienda,
 whose bil is like vnto Al∣boge, or togither with many hoales, and when the time of his death commeth, he gathereth togither dry woodde into his neste, and sitting vpon it, he singeth so swéetely wyth his bill, that he delighteth and pleaseth muche those that heare him, and then flittering with his wings vppon the wood, there cōmeth fire, and he letteth hymselfe burne, & then there commeth a worme out of his neste, and of hys ashes, and of it bréedeth the birde, vnto the likenesse of that byrdes byl. Those of that country made the Alnogue with the which they play very swéetly. And 
Nicholas
 mar∣uelling much of it, they tolde him of what the making of it procéeded. Also there is in the first 
India,
 in an Iland cal∣led 
Saylana,
 a riuer named 
Arotanie,
 so full of fishe, that easily they maye take them vp with their handes, but as soone as a manne holdeth one of these fishes in his hande,


there commeth vnto him a Feuar, and letting the fish go, the Feuar is gone from hym, the cause of it appeareth to be the nature of the fish, as among vs there is a fish which we call 
Torpedo,
 whych fish if a man do hold in his hand, it will be num, and grieue him: although the 
Indians
 saye, that it commeth by meanes of their Goddes, by a certaine tale that they do tell of it.


AFter, for an information to the reader, kéeping y
e
 truth of the Historie, I did write those things rehearsed, as the sayd 
Nicholas
 gaue report, and then there came ano∣ther out of the high 
India,
 which standeth towardes Sep∣tentrion, or the North, and he came, sente vnto the Pope for to sée the things and manners of these parties, for in those parties they had fame, that in the Occident or west there was another worlde, being Christians. And this mā declared that neare vnto 
Cataya
 there was a kingdome, which indured twentie dayes iourney, the which king and people were Christians, but of the sect of the Nestorians. He declared that the Patriach of the Nestorians had sent him for to bring him tydings certaine from these parties. He rehearsed that they had bigger, & more richer Chur∣ches than ours, being al vaulted, and that their Patriarch was very rich in golde and in siluer, that euery father of family did giue yearelye vnto him an ounce of siluer. I communed with this man, by an interpretet whych could the Turkish tong, and the Latin, and I demaunded of him by meanes of this, the wayes, & townes, houses, customs, manners, and of other things that a man delighteth to heare, there was great difficultie to learne it, for lacke of the interpreter, and also of the 
Indian,
 but he affirmed the power of the great 
Cane,
 or Emperoure of al men, to be greate and mighty, for he had vnder him nyne mighty kings.


Also he declared that he hadde trauelled many months through the high 
Scithia,
 is nowe 
Tartaria,
 and throughe 
Persia,
 and that finallye he came vnto the riuer 
Euphrates,
 from whence he entered into the sea, and sayled vnto 
Tri∣p
le,
 and from thence to 
Venice,
 and from thence to 
Flo∣rence.
 He reported to haue séene manye Cities more fai
e than ours, both in publike edifications, and of Citizens, for he declared to haue séene many cities ten myles, and of twentie myles in compasse. And after that this man had spokē with 
Eugenius
 the fourth Pope of that name, he wēt from 
Florence
 for to sée 
Rome
 in deuotion: he demaunded neyther siluer nor gold, séeming, that he came not for gain, but only to fulfil the message of hym that sent him.


IN the same time there came vnto the Pope certaine men from 
Ethiopia,
 in deuotion of the faith, with whō I had communication, by an interpreter, to knowe if they knew any thing of y
e
 riuer of 
Nilus,
 and of his springing. Two of them gaue answere, that they were of a countrey being very neare vnt
 two welsprings, from whence the riuer 
Nilus
 procéedeth: when I hearde this, I coueted to knowe the things that of this matter the olde auntiente Phylosophers, namely 
Ptolomes,
 did write: firste of the fountaines of 
Nilus.
 It appeareth not that they knewe it, but only by coniecture, to appeare that they drew out some things of the Originall increase of the sayde riuer. And as these witnesses of sighte, did tell me of these and of others worthy to remayne in memorie, it séemed vnto me verye good to write them.


They declared that the Riuer 
Nilus
 hadde his heade and Welspryng neare vnto the Region Equinoctiall at the foote of verye hyghe mountaynes, whyche are alwayes couered on the toppe with Mistes, from thrée welsprings, two of them standing 40. paces the one from


the other, and in 500. paces they méete, and make the riuer so great, that no man may passe ouer but with boate. The thirde which is the biggest, standeth a thousand paces frō the other two, and he commeth into the riuer of the o∣thers, ten myles off. Also they sayde that more than 1000. riuers did enter into 
Nilus,
 and it increaseth so muche in those countryes, with the raine of March, April, and May, that it maketh 
Nilus
 to swell ouer so muche, that it made wonderfull great floudes. Also they declared that the wa∣ter of 
Nilus
 was verye swéete and sauerie, before he ente∣reth among the other Riuers, and it hath vertue to heale those that haue the leaprie and scabs, if they washe them∣selues in it. And beyonde the headsprings of 
Nilus
 fiftéene dayes iourney, there be verye fruitefull countries, ful of people, and well tilled, hauing very notable Cities, and also sayde that beyonde that countrey there was the sea, but they had not séene it, and that neare vnto the spring of 
Nilus
 there was a Citie, wherein they were borne, and it was fiue and twentie myles in compasse, full of people, and in the night had 1000. watches for to defende the Ci∣tie from daunger and alterations that might rise. This region is temperate, and delectable, and plentifull of alll thyngs, in so much as 3. times in the yere there springeth new grasse, and twice in the yeare it beareth corne. It hath abundaunce of broade and wine, although the most parte of 
Ethiopia
 vse (in steade of wine) barley sodden in water. They haue figges, Peaches, Orenges, and Cucumbers like vnto our Lemmons, Sytrons, and sauing Almonds. They haue al our kinde of fruites▪ Also they named diuers trées that they had, whiche we neuer sawe nor hearde of in our parties, and they are difficult to write, 
or that the interpreter could not altogither vnderstande the 
Arabian
 tongue. But of one of those trées, I muste néedes re∣hearse, whiche is as thicke as a man maye compasse, and as highe as a man. It hath many rynes one


within another, and betwéene those rines hath his fruite like vnto the Chestnut, and being ground, it becommeth meale, and of it they do make pleasant white bread, which they do vse in their bākets. The leafe of this trée is more than a cubit in breadth, and more than two cubits in length. They sayd also, that towardes the Ilande 
Meroe,
 the 
Nilus
 coulde not be sayled, by reason of the number of Rockes that were there, and that from 
Meroe
 vnto 
Egipt,
 it was naui
able, but they tarrie sixe moneths in the Na∣uigation, for that the riuer giueth manye turnes. Those that dwell in that Countrey, haue the face of the Sunne towardes the North, as we haue it towardes the South, and in March they haue it right ouer their heads. All 
E∣thiopia
 hath one manner of letters, although they haue di∣uers languages, according vnto the greatnesse of the pro∣uinces. Some of them that dwell in the regions towards the Sea coast, and in the hart of the 
India,
 there was very much Ginger, Cloues, Nutmegs, and Suger. Betwéene 
Ethiopia
 and 
Egipt
 there be desertes of .50. dayes iourney, and they trauell so farre, hauing with them prouision of meate and drinke vpon Cammels. It hath dangerous passages in many places, by reason of the wilde men that go naked in those deserts, like wild beastes riding vppon Cammels, whose flesh and milke they do eate. They doe robbe the Cammels and prouision that the trauellers ca∣rie, so that many dye for hunger, and for this cause there passe fewe that way vnto vs. The 
Ethiopians
 most com∣monly are of longer life than we, for many liue vntil .120. yeares, and .150. yeares, and in some places they liue tyll 200. yeares. It is a Countrey much inhabited, and neuer hath the plage, nor other infirmities, so with this, & with their long liues, their multitude is much encreased. They haue diuers customes, according to the diuersitie of the Countrey. They haue no wooll, but weare linnen and silk both men and women. And in some places, the women


weare long traines, and a girdle of a spanne breade, trim∣med with gold and precious stones. Some of them weare vpon their heads a Lawne, weaued with gold: and some weare their heare loose: and some wound vp in a lace han∣ging downe at their backes. They haue more plentye of gold and precious stones than we. The men vse to weare rings, and the women braselets wrought of gold and pre∣cious stones. From Christmas vnto Lent they feast eue∣rie day, eating and daunsing. They do vse little Tables, so that two or thrée may sitte at one of them, and do couer them with table clothes as we do. They haue but one King, whiche is entituled King of Kings, after or vnder God, and they saye, he hath many Kings vnder him, and that they haue diuers kinds of beastes. The Oxen are crooke backed, like vnto Camels, with hornes of thrée cubites in length bending vpon their backes, so that vp∣pon one of their hornes they do carrie a Rundlet of wine. Their dogges are of the bignesse of our Asses, and there is some of them that may do more than a Lion, and hunt with them. They haue very great Elephants, and bring vp some of them for their pleasure & for hostilitie, & some for the warres. They bring them vp of yong ones, & tame them, and then kill the old. Their téeth are of sixe cubites in length. Also, they do tame and bring vp Lions, and to shew them for a magnificēce and ostentation. Also, there is a kind of beastes of diuers couloures like vnto the Ele∣phant, but they haue not suche a tronke and snoute, they do call him Belus. They haue féete like vnto a Camell, and two very sharp hornes, each of a cubit in length, the one standeth in his forehead, and the other vpon his nose. Also, there is another beast somewhat lōger thā a Hare, but in all proportions like, whiche they name 
Zebet,
 and hath such a strong smell, that if at any time he rubbe himselfe againste any small trée, he leaueth behinde hym such a swéete sauour, that those that trauell and smell it, 
utt
 off that part of the trée where the sent is, and carrie


it with them, and in small 
 sell it déerer th
 
 Also they reported, that there is another kinde of Beast, of nine cubits in length, and sixe foote in height, hauyng clouen féete like vnto an Oxe. Their body is a cubit in compasse, and much like in haire vnto the Libard, headed like vnto a Camell, and hathe a necke of four cubites in length. His tayle is very thicke, and muche estéemed, for the women do worke with it, emb
odering it with preci∣ous stones, hanging them at their armes. They haue a∣nother wild beast, which they do take hunting, and he is to be eaten. He is as bigge as an Asse, striped with cou∣loures redde and gréene, and hathe wreathed hornes vp∣ward, of thrée cubites in length. Also, there is another much like vnto a Hare, with little hornes, and of coulour redde, whiche giueth a greate leape. There is another muche like vnto a Goate, with his hornes vpon his but∣tockes more than two cubites pending, and for that the smoke of them healeth Feauers, they are solde for more than fortie Duckets a péece. There is another much like vnto this Beast, sauing that he hathe no hornes. His hayre is redde, hauing a necke of two cubites in length. There is another bodyed lyke vnto a Camell, and of the couloure of a Lybarde, hauing a necke of fire cubites in length. They sayd he had a head like vnto a Déere. Also they sayd they had a bird of the heigth from the ground of sixe cubites, small legges, féete like a Goose, the necke and visage like vnto a Henne. This bird flyeth little, but runneth faster than a Horse.


Many other things they told me, whiche I leaue vn∣written, for that I finde my selfe wéerie. And they sayd, that there were Serpents in the Desertes without féete, of fiftie cubits in length, hauing a Scorpions tayle, and swallow a whole Cau
fe at once. And in these things al∣most they did all agrée, and it séemed vnto me that they made no lie, séeing they had no cause why for to lye, and I thought good to write it, for y
e
 profit of those y
e
 lis
 to re
