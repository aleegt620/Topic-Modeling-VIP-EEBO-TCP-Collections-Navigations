To the right honourable Sir 
Iohn
Puckering,
 Knight Lorde Keeper of the great
Seale of England, Thomas Tymme, wisheth
increase of honour here, to Gods glo∣rie;
and perpetuall felicitie in the
worlde to come.


F
Orsomuch as (right
honorable) 
Jerusa∣lem,

the citty of our
God, euen vppon
his holy mountaine
the ioy of the whole
earth, and the Cit∣tie
of the greate
King, that faire and
most auncient Cit∣tie,
by a speciall prerogatiue is by God him
selfe bewtified aboue all other Citties: and
was therefore the cheefe, most noble and fa∣mous
Cittie of the worlde: Many trauellers
and Pilgrimes, haue at sundry times both in
Mappes and histories, described the same.
By the aduantage of whose laboures therein,
now of late one 
Christien Adrichom,
 hath per∣formed


a most liuely description, and in the
Latine tongue enriched with diuers antiquy∣ties.
The profit that might come hereby to
my countrimen of the vulgar sorte, both for
the better vnderstanding of the story of the
Bible, where 
Jerusalem
 and the partes there∣of
are often times mentioned, and also for the
ready conceauing of 
Josephus his history,
 mo∣ued
me to translate it into the english tongue:
And the book thus translated, with the charts
expressed in naturall coloures, I haue presu∣med
to dedicate vnto your honour. And bi∣cause
the maister workeman in this new plat
of ould decayed 
Jerusalem,
 hath left behind
him sum rubbish and reliques of the Romish
superstition, I haue in some measure purged
and swept the stretes and corners of the same,
with the broome of truth, and carying them
out by the Scouregate haue layed them on
the Leystall of obliuion. My paines herein ta∣ken,
though not so great, as the laying of 
Ieru¦salems

foūdation, or the raising of a chief cor∣ner
stone or the squaring & finishing any part
of this exquisite plat: yet such it is, as euen in
the meanest degree of a poore labourer, that
doth but sweepe the streetes, I most humbly
beseech your honor to accept as a small mite


of my good will: The which I gladly offer, to
the ende, that amidst the greate burdens of
your most weighty affaires, your honour be∣houlding
this most braue cittie, adorned with
so glorious a temple, and contemplating the
passion of our sauiour Christ therein, may be
delighted and recreated: And further, that
viewing this terrestriall cittie, whose glory is
now vanished, may thinke still as the Apostle
did say, 
Non habemus hîc manentem ciuitatem,

and so aspire to that heauenly 
Jerusalem,
 gar∣nished
and full stored with all manner of de∣lights
which abideth for euer: wherein 
I
 doo
moste humbly and hartely wish your good
Lordship a most happie residence, after you
haue performed your most honorable course
in this life, in the seruice of your
country, the pleasure of your
prince, the generall benefit
and comfort of your
own soule.


Your Honors most dutifull
to command,
Tho: Tymme.










The Preface.


F
Orsomuch, the truth of historie, is
the foundation of faith, and of spi∣rituall
vnderstanding, (Christian
Reader,) and the history of things
donne, blinde and imperfect, with∣out
the knowledge of places, the
which knowledge giueth muche
light, both to the truth of history, and also to the spiritu∣all
interpretation thereof: therefore I haue thought good
to obserue two things with great diligence in this worke.
First that I might portray and set forth the true and liue∣ly
Image of 
Ierusalem,
 of all other citties the most glori∣us
and famous throughout the whole world, whereof men∣tion
is made in sacred and in prophane histories, as it flori∣shed
in Christ his time; and also the forme of the temple,
(the fame whereof hath beene extolled aboue the heauens,
and was worthy of eternall memory) by the sacred Scrip∣tures,
by approued writers, and by auncient tradition of
faithfull and trusty men, in a liuely plot, or map, most e∣quisitly
drawn, together with the names, originalls, situ∣ations,
and formes of euery place, and the most worthy hi∣stories
concerning the same, with all breuity. Secondly,
that I might rightly dispose the places of Christ his passi∣on,
and represent euery thing which he suffered in euery
place, euen as if they were now donne before our eies: and
so represented that I might, explaine it with plainenesse
and breuity. For hereby, all those thinges which he suf∣fered
for our sakes, wilbe both more plainely vnderstood,
and also more profitably remembred. But per aduenture
there wilbe some which will mislike this our endeuour,
and the rather bicause we haue many thinges by tradition
of elders: to whom I answere out of Saint 
Hierom
 where


he saith, 
That ecclesiasticall traditions, which are no
hinderance to faith, are so to be kept, as they were de∣liuered
by the auncients.
 In the meane time I will not
say, that they are too rash & too too wicked, which wil de∣ny
that thing,
 which hath beene godly receiued at al times
and of all men.
 So many of vs therefore as washed with
the bloud of Christ, do beare his name and are called Chri∣stians,
if our faith be aunswering to our name, and our life
not disagreeing from the truth, hoping to be saued by the
merits & grace of Christ our sauiour, let vs beleeue that,
which incorrupt and reuerend antiquity hath left, let vs
in no wise depart from those thinges which our auncestors
haue celebrated without superstition, and which by the
consent of the whole worlde, are come euen from them to
our hands, and with thankful godlines, and godly thankful∣nesse,
let vs call to minde those places oftentimes, which
may put vs in rememberance of the passion of Christe: to
which places this mappe will leade vs, as it were by the
hande: and with the eies of faith and of our minde let vs
looke vpon the same sonne of God, and inwardly behoulde
him, who being vrged with the great loue of our saluati∣on,
hauing finished his laste supper in the parlour of Sion
and being come into the Garden of Oliuet, prayed and
swet bloud, through the anguish and greuous considerati∣on
of the Imminent afflictions. Immediately hee was be∣trayed
by the most wicked Iudas; he was taken, bounde,
and thrust forward by the Iewes, euen as a lambe by the
woolues, most cruelly amidst the noise of clamors and wea∣pons,
and then was ledde to the house of 
Anna
 the high
priest: There hee was stricken: From thence hee was
drawne to the pallace of 
Caiphas:
 in the same, hee was
falsely accused, condemned, spyt vpon, blindfolded, buffe∣ted
with fistes, and sundry waies all the night scorned and
afflicted. In the morning he was violently caried through
the midst of the cittie to the house of 
Pilate.
 From thence


he was led to the pallace of 
Herod
 and accufed againe, de∣spised
of him, mocked, & apparrelled like a foole in a white
garment, & brought back again by another way of the city
to 
Pilate.
 There again he was accused of many faultes, strip¦ped,
and greuously whipped, cloathed with purple, crowned
with thornes, dyuersly derided, spitted vppon, buffetted
with fistes and stricken with a reede▪ and being thus mis∣used,
was made a gazeing stocke to the people and adiud∣ged
to death. Then he was loden with a heauie crosse, and
in the sight of all the people, with greeuous and bloudy steps
hee was drawen, punched: and vrged by the furiouse vi∣olence
of the soldiers, through a great parte of the cittie,
and by the gate of Iudgement out of the cittie, by a harde
and stoany way, euen vnto mount, 
Caluarie.
 And being
come thither he was stripped againe, and being both faint
and weary, was refreshed with gaule in stede of drink: and
about high noone he was fastened to the crosse, & so lifted
vpon high. And hanging on the crosse by the space of three
howers, was derided with taunts & reproachfull woordes:
being thirstie, they gaue him vineger to drinke. Finally
he which could saue the world with one drop of his bloude
would needes bestowe vppon vs by the fiue Riuers of his
woundes, his life, with all his bloude. A figure hereof
was that brasen serpent,
 which moses caused to be exalted
in the wildernes. To this spectacle also our heauenly fa∣ther
calleth euery faithfull soule, 
Come forth
 (saith he)

ye daughters of Sion, and see king Salomon,
 Naye one
farre greater then 
Salomon.
 In like manner Christ han∣ging
on the crosse crieth out 
O all ye which passe by the
way, behould and see, if there be any sorrow & greefe
like myne.


And not onely to the consideration and meditation of
these things, but also to the Imitation, God in the holy
Scripture exhorteth vs in these woordes (spiritually in∣terpreted)
saying, 
Looke, & make all thinges according


to the example or fashion which was shewed thee in
the mount.
 For all the precepts of life, which our sauiour
taught all the time of his preaching,
 as well by word as by
example, the same he expressed in himselfe in one day of
his passion: Wherefore if we would follow Christ, not onely
in woorde but also in woorke, we may, by his liuely crucifi∣ed
Image on mount Caluarie, as it were out of a goulden
booke intituled with the noble title of three most principal
languages, written with the quils of the speare, of the nails
of the thornes, and of the whippes, in the most pure parch∣ment
of the Immaculat lambe, and with the purple bloude
of the same, both learned and vnlearned, learne easely &
breifly, perfect theologie, the most wholesome remedies of
Phisicke, the full knowledge of Lawe and of Iustice, the
science of liberall artes, of true humilitie, of obedience, of
pietie, of charitie, of patience, finally of all manner of ver∣tues,
and of thinges most perfect: and may also bee inflamed
and drawen to loue and to follow Christ. Thus the blessed
virgin, standing nere to the crosse of Christ, did not onely
with bodely eies, but also in hart, through faith (which wa∣uered
not in her) behould the woundes of her sonne and se∣riously
thinking thereon, was so comforted, that now, as

Ambrose
 saith she was prepared also to die for the good
of mankind.
 So saint Ihon both seing the side of Christ o∣pened
with a speare,
 bloude with water comming foorth of
the same, and also giuing testimonie thereunto, did by the
meditation thereof so greatly profite, that at the last he be∣came
a most perfect diuine, and a soaring Eagle to behoulde
the most holy Trinitie.
 So the Theefe, when he sawe and
hearde Christ Iesus crucified,
 in continently tourned vnto
Christ, and confessing him, he made the punishment of mur¦der
martiredome, and chaunged the crosse for Paradice.
So also the 
Centurion
 by this spectacle,
 receaued so great
strength of faith, that vnder the crosse he was made a fa∣mous


confessor of Christ, and further (as 
Chrysostome

saith) was afterwarde crowned with 
Martyredome.

Moreouer 
Thomas
 behoulding & touching the wounds
of Christ crucified, was so illumined with faith, that hee
plainly and openly professed Christ, to be both his Lord and
his God.


This beeing so, and loue procuring loue, euen as the
loadstone draweth Ironne: who is hee, I pray you, whome
so vehement loue of Christ, nay rather a heate and flame
will not affecte, kindell, and sette on fier? Who is he when
at the death of Christ all creatures do suffer with him, the
Sunne darkened, the vaile of the Temple rent in sonder,
the earth quaking, Rockes breaking, graues opening, and
the deade arising, who and what is hee (I say) that will
not woonder, and that will not be abasshed? Onely Adams
children, for whose cause he died are not moued with this
so great a benefite.


The Adamente, that most harde stoane, is mollified
with the bloude of a goate: Iron with the heate of fier is
made softe:
 but the hartes of Christians more harde then
Adamant or Iron, are not mollified with the bloude and
fier of Christ▪ but do crucifie a fresh vnto themselues the
sonne of God, and do tread vnder their feete the bloude of
the testament.


What I pray you can be more beseeming, more meete,
more Iuste, and more profitable for vs, then to loue againe
him that so loueth vs, and Imitate him whome wee loue?
For if any thing herein seme harde, if any thing greuous,
that thing, loue, the sweete yoke of the Lord, maketh light
and easie, for all labor is light, to him that loueth, accor∣ding
to that notable sentence of that auntiente father
saint 
Gregory, Nihil adeo graue est quod non aequani∣miter
toleretur, si Chrsti passio, ad memoriam reduca
tur.
 There is nothing so heauy & burthensome but the same


is willingly borne, if so be the passion of Christ be remem∣bered.


For we will indure all thinges with patience as light
and easie, if we call to mynde what hard wordes, harder
stripes, and most harde paines and afflictions, he suffered
for vs, whose heade was crowned with thornes, his eyes
blinde foulded, his eares filled with reproaches, his mouth
with gaule and vineger, his face polluted with spitting,
his cheekes brused with buffetting, his kneese shaking, his
shoulders laden with the crosse, his hart replenished with
sorrow his bodie torne with whippes, his members racked,
his handes and feete bored,
 to be breefe from the crowne of
the heade to the soales of the foot, he sustained an Innume∣rable
sort of woundes and sorrowes. Wherefore as the wa∣ters

Mara,
 being sometimes bitter, were made swete by

Moses,
 at what time he cast wood into them: euen so all
our tribulation, if we patiently indure the crosse of Christ,
will waxe sweete, and the gaule thereof will: tourne into
honny. For by the meditations of these afflictions of our sa∣uiour,
faith is illumined, hope strengthened, charitie infla∣med,
and all vertue increased. Wherefore saint Augustine
a light of the Church, no lesse truly then godly, prouoking
vs by very forceable woordes therevnto: saith thus, 
Be∣hould
the woundes of him that hangeth, the bloud of
him that dieth,
 
the price of the redemer, the scarres of
him that ryseth: His heade boweth to kisse thee, his
hart is opened to loue thee, his armes stretched abroad
to imbrace thee, his whole bodie set forth to redeeme
thee. Consider what and how greate 
hese thinges be,
waigh them in the ballance of your heartes, that hee
may be wholy fastened in your hartes, who for vs was
wholy fastened on the crosse.
 Thus far 
Augustine.
 So
that it is not enough to meditate of these thinges once: but
it is profitable to thinke vpon them often: yea the oftener,
the more they auaile and profite. In the wholesome con∣templation


of whose passion, although we profite much, yet
we shall neuer attaine to the perfite knowledge thereof,
but there will remaine still somewhat that we may seeke
for, the full knowledge wherof is reserued to our heauenly
countrey. In the meane tyme, let vs contemplate in these
thinges day and night, in these things let vs recreate and
busie our selues. In these let vs watch, in these let vs sleep,
yea to die in the meditation of these things, is most Christi∣an,
and auaileable to euerlasting saluation.

THat stately place, that princely bowre

Ennobled with such royall stiles,

And ouer worldlie citties all

Loe, heere presented is to Viewe


in such good currrant sort;


As no penne heretofore perform'd

In daungers great, through countreis staunge

That braue estate which earst it had,

King dauids house, and temple now

Yet sitting still with booke in hand


we here may plaine beholde


The state of ech thing as it was,


in times that were of old.


Where Christ did preach, where Christ did suppe,


where Christ did fast and pray,


Where Christ was caught, where christ was whipt,


where theeues did him betraye:


Where he a precious raunsome paid


for man who had offended;


Where he was buried; where he rose,


and eke where he ascended.



Where

❧ A BRIEFE
DESCRIPTION
OF IERVSALEM AND
THE SVBVRBES THERE∣OF
AS IT FLORISHED IN
THE TIME OF CHRIST.




1 
I
Erusalem

 
the elect Cittie of God,

holy and most glorious, built vpon
the holy mountaines, excelling all
the citties of the world, as well by
the loftinesse of the seate, as by the
moderation and temperature of
the heauens,
 and fruitfulnesse of
soile, was situated in the midest of the whole worlde,
and of 
Iudaea,
 as it were in the very center and heart
of the earth.
 And being as a Queene amongest
all other neighbour citties,
 had the preheminence
as the head ouer the body,
 and shined as the sunne a∣boue
others in sumptuousnes and glorious buildings:
hauing such surpassing excellency,
 she was by a cer∣taine
singular priuiledge in time past, the onely place
which God had chosen to himselfe: and was a figure
not only of euery faithfull mans soule, but also of the


elect Church of Christ militant vppon earth,
 and of
that blessed triumphant Church in heauen.
 A cittie
of perfect beautie:
 the virgin of the worlde, the para∣gon
of all the Easte, and the ioye and reioycing of the
whole earth.


This cittie was builded about the yeare from the
creation of the world,
 two thousand twenty and three,
in the time of 
Abraham,
 by 
Melchisedech
 the Kinge.
In hebrue it was called SALEM; and in Greeke SO∣LYMA:
and it seemeth that hee possessed the same
fiftie yeares.
 The which afterwards the 
Iebusites
 en∣ioyed,

who sprang from 
Iebusi,
 the sonne of 
Chanaan:

of whome it was called for a time 
Iebus,
 and 
Iebusaeum

at what time 
Iosua
 slue the King thereof.
 And the 
Ie∣busites

helde the same,
 eighte hundred and twentie
foure yeares,
 who trusted so much to the strength of
their cittie,
 that when king Dauid assailed the same;
in contempt of him and of his army they placed vp∣on
their walles, the blind, the halt, and the maimed,
saying that these were sufficient to beate backe the e∣nemy.


But when Dauid through Gods helpe enioyed the
cittie,
 the 
Iebusites
 being expulsed, hee reedified the
same rounde, fortified it with a castle, dwelt therein,
and made it the 
Metropolitan
 cittie of the whole pro∣uince
of 
Iudaea,
 and the heade of all the kingdome,
and from thence foorth called it 
Ierusalem,
 as it were

Iebussalem
 the letter b. (to make the better sounde)
tourned into r. Notwithstanding there are some
which write, that it is called 
Ierusalem,
 of the mag∣nificent
temple which Salomon builte therein, as it
were 
Hieron Salomonis.
 For the Greekes call a temple

.
 In continuance of time Salomon and other
kings of 
Iudaea
 greatly enlarged the same, and so for∣tified
it with most strong gates, towers, walles, and


trenches, and so adorned it with a temple, with pal∣laces,
and with most exquisite buildings, that among
other citties it was a miracle of the whole world, and
is therefore more honoured with silence, then with
all that can be said concerning the same.


In this glory and excellency,
 
Ierusalem
 florished
foure hundred seuenty and seuen yeares, as if it had
beene an earthly paradise,
 being in compasse round
about, sixe miles and two hundred and fifty paces.
And by the wall and circuit of the cittie, there was a
stony trench or vaulte threescore foote deepe, and in
bredth two hundred and fiftie, wherein was abiding,
about one hundreth and fiftie thousand men.
 But
when the wickednesse of the Princes and people not
only had profaned the temple with the abhominati∣ons
of Idols,
 but also had filled the cittie euen to the
full with innocent bloud most cruelly shed, the cittie
together with the temple, Princes, and people by the
iust vengeance of God,
 was by 
Nabuchodonoser
 kinge
of 
Babilon
 (but Gods whip) so vtterly ouerthrowne,

and desolated threescore and ten yeares, that 
Sion

was plowed vp like a field, and 
Ierusalem
 was become
as a heape of stones,
 and the mountaine of the tem∣ple,
as it were the height and top of woods, so as in
the meane time (as 
Hierom
 witnesseth) that neither so
much as a bird,
 nor a beast, could flie, or passe through
the same.


Afterwards the temple only being with much a do
and very hardly builded, wanting gates, towers, and
walles, was inhabited againe by the Iewes (retourning
out of the captiuity of 
Babilon
) threescore yeares.


Moreouer within the space of two and fitie dayes,

Nehemia
 inclosed it in compas three miles and seuen
hundred and fity paces,
 with gates, towers & a strong
wall:
 and afterward, the same being bewtified by the



Machabees,
 by 
Herod,
 and by others very stately, with
publique and priuate buildings,
 recouered the former
dignity,
 being very famous and populous by the space
of fiue hundred and foure and twentie yeares:
 hauing
in it many narrow streetes,
 by reason of the exceeding
nomber of houses therein.
 At what time there,
 as in
a Theater,
 Iesus Christ wrought our saluation: and
from thence as from a center, the apostles spred forth
the Euangelicall doctrine throughout the world.


But 
Titus
 Emperour of Rome, being brought by
the iust iudgement of God to take vengeance for the
Death of Christ, the thirtie and eight yeare after his
passion, besieged it round, casting a banke about it, &
shut vppe the Iewes in the Cittie as in a prison, which
came out of euerie Tribe to cellebrate the feast of pas∣ouer
there. Wherevpon that Cittie, the woonder of
the world, was made a denne of theeues, and a sepul∣cher
of dead men. For by reason of ciuill murders,
famine, pestilence, and sword, there perished in the
same, eleuen hundred thousand Iewes. And as for the
Citty it selfe, 
Titus
 did so vtterlie subuert it, that men
which came vnto it, would scarse beleeue that euer it
had beene inhabited. Neuerthelesse, hee left three
principall 
Herodian
 Towers, that is to say 
Hippic, Ma∣riam,

and 
Phasel,
 which were more notable than the
rest, aswell for greatnesse as for beawtie, and that part
of the Citties wall,
 which compassed them from the
West, vnshaken; to the ende, that both it might bee a
Castell for the Romane souldiers which should be left
there for a Garrison, and also to shewe vnto posteritie
what manner of Cittie,
 & how well fortified, the force
of the Romans had subdued.
 But after threescore and
fiue yeares, the Iewes rebelling againe, 
A Elius Adri∣anus

the Emperour slue many thousands of them, and
vtterly subuerted those Towers with the remainder of


the wall,
 and commaunded the Cittie to bee strewed
with salt: whereby it came to passe according to the
prophesie of Christ, that there was not left one stone
of the Cittie vpon a stone. And building the Cittie a∣gaine
in lesse compasse,
 hee excluded mount 
Sion,

with the pallace of 
Salomon,
 and that of the Queene,
and the house of the forrest of 
Libanus,
 also the gate
of the North corner,
 and the tents of the 
Assyrians,

and all the north parte, euen to the dounge gate and
to the gate of 
Ephraim:
 but the mount of 
Caluary,
 and
the sepulcher of the Lord, which were aforetime with¦out
the walles, hee inclosed with the North walles of
the cittie; and set the picture of a sow cut in Marble
vpon the forefrunt of that gate, by which men go to

Bethleem,
 thereby giuing to vnderstande, that the
Iewes subiect to that law of swines flesh, were vnder
the power of the Romaines: whom by an 
Edict
 he for∣bad
neuer more to enter into that cittie,
 or looke into
the same from the top of any higher place, and from
thenceforth commanded it to be called 
AEliam Ca∣pitoliam,

after his owne name.
 But after this, being
inhabited of the Christians, and dignified with a 
Pa∣triarchall

seate, receiuing againe in continuance of
time the name of 
Ierusalem,
 florished fiue hundred
yeares in Christian religion,


And in the yeare after the birth of Christ sixe hun∣dred
thirty and six,
 it was taken by the 
Saracens
 which
raigned in Egipt, and so possessed foure hundred three
score and three yeares.


After this in the yeare of Christ,
 1099 the cittie

Ierusalem
 was recouered by the Christians hauing for
their Captaine, 
Godfrey
 of 
Bullion,
 who was the firste
that entred vpon the wall of the cittie with great cou∣rage
and most fierce assalt, the 
Ides
 of 
Iuly,
 the very
same day and houre, wherein Christ died: And so


greate slaughter was made, throughout al the streetes,
lanes,
 and corners of the cittie, that no man coulde
passe but ouer the deade bodies of the slaine: and so
exceeding was the effusion of bloud, that men went
ouer their shooes in the bloud of the dead:
 insomuch
that the conquerers themselues were from the sole of
the foote to the crowne of the heade imbrued with
bloud. Who when they enioyed the cittie, putting
off their armour, and clensing themselues from their
bloud, visited the places of Christs passion, resurrecti∣on,
and ascension (which the faithful that dwelt in 
Ie∣rusalem

shewed vnto them) and beheld them with re∣uerence.
The eight day after with one conssent they
elected Duke Godfrey, and created him the king of 
Ie∣rusalem.

But the man being full of Godlinesse and hu∣mility,
would not be crowned with a crowne of gold
after the manner of Kinges, in the holy cittye, but
contented himselfe and reuerenced the like crowne
of thornes, with the which the emperour of mankind
was crowned in the same place, when he went to be
crucified for our saluation.


Ierusalem
 therefore being recouered by the Chri∣stians
was so held and enioyed by them fourescore
and eight yeares.
 Afterward namely in the yeare,
1187. the second day of october, the Christian prin∣ces
(wo and alas) disagreing amonge themselues, 
Ie∣rusalem

was deliuered vp to 
Saladine
 the 
Soldane
 of
Egypt,
 vppon this condition that it should be lawfull
for the Christians to departe with bag and baggage:
the which 
Saladine
 held it three hundred and thirtie
yeares.
 But in the yeare of our Lord, 1517. it was in∣uaded
by 
Selimo
 the emperour of turques, & is at this
day in the same compasse of walles possessed by the
Turkes:
 who name it 
Cusumobarech
 or 
Codsbarich,
 that
is to say, a holy cittie. So that from the first foundati∣on


thereof vnto this present yeare one thousand, fiue
hundred, ninety foure are passed three thousand, fiue
hundred, thirtie and one yeares.






THE FIRST PART OF THE CITTIE. THE PLACES VVITHIN THE CITTIE.




2 
M
OVNT SION,


which is called y
e
 mount
of the Lorde, and the 
Holy Mountaine,

is much more higher then other moun∣taines
and larger:
 after the fashion of a
Theater in the fourme of a halfe cir∣cle
compassing the cittie on the south parte.
 And
being set as a looking glas on a high place,
 founded by
God vppon a firme rocke,
 on euery side broken off,
had a plainenes thereon like to a towne, and being ve∣ry
pleasant and recreatiue, it represented the excel∣lencie
and delights of heauen.
 Whose top the 
Iebu∣sites

first of all fortified with a strong castle, and the
compasse thereof with firme and loftie walles, with
gates,
 and with towers. Whome when Dauid the
king had expulsed, he made the castle and the walles
round about,
 the gates and the towers, much more
defensible,
 and made the top and plainenesse of the
hill into streetes and lanes, and builded there for him∣selfe,
for his nobles and worthies, houses, and called it
the cittie of Dauid: which now also 
Iosephus
 calleth
the higher cittie, and the holy parte. The 
Machabees

reedifying the same mountaine in compasse,
 made it
most stronge with many walles,
 and lofty towers, in
such wise as notwithstanding any force, it was inuinci∣ble,
only by famine it might be surprised: where were
many straight and narrow passages, and many houses
of cittizens placed.











From this mountaine,
 according to the foretelling
of the prophets,
 a law, and an euangelicall light came
forth,
 and as it were from the head it selfe, it was spred
forth into the whole bodie of the world, for the sauing
health of all nations.
 The which when the Romanes
by the iudgement and will of God, against all hope of
man, and without bloudshed had taken (the seditious
within the Citty beeing stricken with a sudden feare,
and roaming heere and there from the wall, and hi∣ding
themselues in their sinkes) being dispersed in all
corners and streetes with their naked swordes, slue all
that they met withall,
 hauing no regard of persons or
sex,
 and set fire on the houses burning them and all
those that were fled into them,
 and destroying manie
houses whereinto they entred for pillage sake,
 where
finding whole families dead (whome the famine had
consumed) they so abhorred the sight thereof that
they returned backe againe emptie,
 running thorowe
with their swordes all that they met,
 and so filling the
streetes with dead bodies, that the whole Citty flow∣ed
with bloud in such aboundance, that (as 
Iosephus

witnesseth) many things burning, were quenched with
the plentifull bloud of the slaine. But night comming
on the slaughter began to cease, but the burning in∣creased.
The next day following, 
Titus
 being ente∣red
into the Citty woondered at the fortifications of
the Cittie, and at the rockes of the towers, which the
Tyrants through follie had willinglie forsaken. To be
briefe, when hee had seene their substantiall altitude
and inuincible force, we haue fought (saith he) by the
manifest helpe of God, and it was God which draue
out the Iewes from these holdes. For what hands of
men, or what engines of warre might haue preuailed
against these? Many such words spake he to his frends.
This mountaine though it were excluded out of the


cittie, yet afterward it was builded againe and inhabi∣ted.
But now being in the Suburbs most ruinous, it
lieth wast.








THE PLACES OF MOVNT SION.




3. THe Castell of 
Sion


being ancient and strong, was
set on the verie toppe of mount 
Sion,
 round like a
crown, and was a sure defence and beautie both of the
Cittie and Temple,
 and was as the capitall or chiefe
place of so great a cittie.
 Heerein the 
Iebusites

dwelte at the firste: whome Dauid casting out by
force,
 enioyed the castle, and receiuing from 
Hiram

king of 
Tyrus,
 stones, wood, and artificers, builded out
of the same a strong pallace for himselfe,
 and a house
of Cedar with a kingly throne. In the which castle
afterward, Dauid himselfe and other kings of Iuda in∣habited,
and vsed the same for the kinges seat. And
for this cause it was continually kept with a straight
garde of souldiors.
 And in processe of time it was cal∣led
the kings castle,
 and the house of Dauid, the seate
and throne of Dauid,
 also the Court and kings house.
In this castle the most cruell of all tyrantes 
Antiochus

king of 
Syria,
 which in Greeke was called 
,

that is to say 
Renoumed,
 (but more truly 
, that
is 
Mad,
 he deserued to be called) placed a garrison of
Gentiles: whereby in the time of the 
Machabes
 hee
afflicted the Iewes very much a long time. The which
when 
Simon Machabaeus
 had inforced to yeeld thrugh
famine, and had cleansed the castle from the pollusi∣on
of Idols, they entered therinto with palmes in their


hands with Cimbals, with psalterions, with hymnes
and songes: and he placed therein men of the Iewes
to defend the Cittie and countrey, yet nowe there is
nothing to be seene but the ruines thereof.






4. THE KINGS PRISON


with a lofty Tower,
 which
ouerlooked the kings house.
 Into this prison Iere∣mie
was cast, because hee prophesied that the Cittie
should be taken: and at the last was deliuered out of
the same by 
Nabuchadonezer,
 when the Cittie was
taken.






5. 
CAESARS
 and 
AGRIPPAS
 hall,


 was the kings
house, which 
Herod
 the 
Ascalonite
 builded for
himselfe in the vppermost cittie: for he builded in his
pallace two great and faire houses of polished marble
and fine gold, wherevnto the Temple it selfe was not
comparable, and calling them after the names of 
Cae∣sar
Augustus,
 and of 
Agrippa
 his sonne in law, his
friends, he named the one 
CAESARS,
 and the other

AGRIPPAS.






6. THE PARLOVR OF 
SION


was scituate about
the middest of mount 
Sion,
 being large, paued,
 and
verie faire:
 wherein Christ in his last supper did eate
the paschall Lambe with his disciples,
 washed their
feete, and instituted the sacrament of his most blessed
body and bloud.
 In the fame, on the day of his resur∣rection
(when he was entered,
 the dores being shut)
standing in the middest of his disciples, he shewed vn∣to
them the wounds of his side, of his hands and feete,


and did eate before them: after that, breathing vpon
them,
 he gaue them the holy ghost, and therewithall
power to remit, and reteine the sinnes of all manner
persons. The eight day after this, here he offered vn∣to

Thomas
 the Apostle the prints and scarres of the
speare and nailes to see and feele.
 Here, after the Lords
ascension,
 
Matthias
 was by lot chosen into the Apo∣stleship
of 
Iudas
 the traitour. Here on the day of Pen∣tecost,
the holy Ghost came downe in a great sounde,
and in the forme of fierie toonges, lighted vppon one
hundred and twenty beleeuers: and at the first sermon
of Peter, three thousand Iewes were conuerted and
baptized. In this place 
Iames
 the Lordes brother sir∣named

Iust,
 was by the Apostles created the first Bi∣shop
of Ierusalem: and 
Stephen
 with six more, were
ordained Deacons. Heere the Apostles entered into
the first consultation, or councell, and set downe the
twelue Articles of Christian faith.






7. THE CYPRES trees of Mount 
Sion,


 which were
very excellent, whereof the booke called 
Ecclesi∣asticus

maketh mention.






8. THE HOVSE OF 
Annas,


 the chiefe priest, the
father in law of 
Caiaphas,
 wherein Christ was ex∣amined
of 
Annas
 concerning his Disciples and his
doctrine, at what time he aunswered that he had
taught openly before all men, for the which
he receiued a blow on the cheek
by a seruant.








9. THE HOVSE OF THE WOORTHIES,


wherin
the strong men, and valiant peeres of king Dauid
dwelt:
 where also as in a wrestling place, the cheefe
wrestlers and champions, for exercise sake, vsed to try
maisteries.






10. THE HOVSE OF THE VIRGIN MARY,


 wher∣in
after the death of her sonne she dwelt with Iohn
the Apostle.






11. THE HOVSE OF VRIA,


 one of the most valiant
souldiors of Dauid, whose wife 
Bethsabe,
 bathing
her selfe in a fountaine of her Garden (which also is
to be seene in the map) by her beautie allured Dauid
to adultery, beholding her from a gallerie of y
e
 kinges
house.






12. THE VPPER MARKET,


 by reason whereof, the
vpper cittie also, was called sometimes the vpper
market.






13. THE STAIRES OF THE CASTLE,


 or prison,
whereon the Apostle Paule stood, when hee made
aunswer for himselfe.






14. THE STAIRES OF SION


,
 by which men went
vppe to the cittie of Dauid.








15 THE KINGES GARDEN,


 the which also was
called the garden of Oza,
 wherin 
Manasses
 and 
A∣mon

kinges of Iuda were buried.






16 MELLO,


a valley or dale, very deepe and wide,
which lay betwene mount 
Sion
 and the lower
citty,
 and extended it selfe from the water gate to the
fish gate.
 Dauid builded and compassed mount 
Sion

round about from this valley:
 the concauity and bot∣tome
whereof Salomon did make leuell and plaine,

that it mighte bee a conuenient streete:
 and from
thence forth it was called the streete of the water gate.

He also bewtified the same with buildings,
 which be∣ing
decaied, was repaired by Ezechias. In this place
it was that 
Ioas
 king of Iuda was slaine by his seruants
in the way downe to 
Sela.
 But in 
Iosephus
 time, this
valley was called 
Tyropoeon,
 and was very large and
full of dwelling houses.
 At this day this valley is so
filled vp with earth and stones, that there remaineth
only a small shew of the former concauity & depenes.






17 THE PALLACE OF CAIPHAS;


belonging
to euery high prieste, large and square: wherein
somtime dwelled 
Eliasib
 the cheef priest.
 In this pal∣lace
the princes of the people being gathered toge∣ther,

consulted among themselues what pollicy they
might vse to catch Iesus,
 and to kill him:
 to whome
he was there soulde by 
Iudas
 for thirty peeces of sil∣uer.

Afterwards also he was thrise denyed by 
Peter:

and was by false witnesses of the Iewes, accused before

Caiphas
 in the counsell of the priestes and elders, to


whom when hee answered nothing beeing straightly
charged by the high priest, to tell whether hee were
Christ the sonne of God, the which when he confes∣sed,
hee was conuinced as it were of blasphemy, the
cheefe priest calling for the sentence of the counsell,
threescore and six elders condemned him to be wor∣thy
of death, and aunswering said, 
He is worthy to die.

Wherevpon the seruants and souldiors, did presently
spit in his face, they blinde-folded him, buffeted him
with their fistes, commaunding him to prophesie,
scorned him all the night with sundry mockes, and
vexed him with many blasphemies, and that I may
speake much in few words, no mortall man in this life
is able to expresse, what and how much hee endured
this night. And in the morning following, the rulers
of the Iewes assembled together in this place againe,
to deliuer him vp to death: and leading him bounde,
they deliuered him to 
Pilate
 the deputie.






18. THE FOVNTAINE OF SION,


the which was
made with great labour and cost.






19. THE BRIDGE OF SION,


 by which men went
through the valley out of the vpper cittie vnto the
Temple.






20. THE GATES OF SION,


 which the Lord loueth
more than all the Tabernacles of Iacob.






21. THE VPPER GATE,


 by which 
Ioas
 when he was
crowned king of Iuda in the Temple, and guarded


with the princes of the Iewes, was led into the pallace
of the kings of 
Iuda.






22. THE SEPVLCHER OF DAVID,


 together with
the field wherin the kings were buried,
 the which
verie stately was placed aloft in the citty of Dauid:

wherein Dauid himselfe,
 
Salomon,
 and other kings of
Iuda, also 
Ioyada
 the chiefe priest were buried. Into
this monument of Dauids sepulture,
 
Salomon
 brought
great treasure at his burial. The which 
Hircanus
 y
e
 high
priest & captain opening, brought from thence 3000.
talents of siluer.
 Not long after this, 
Herod
 the 
Ascalo∣nit

king of Iewes,
 went about also to bring much trea∣sure
out from thence,
 but a flame of fire breaking forth
and consuming two of his souldiors, he left off his en∣terprise,

and to make satisfaction for himselfe, hee a∣dorned
the same monument with faire shining Mar∣ble,

which continued there a long time after. Where y
e


Saracens
 afterwarde builded a church for themselues
which standeth as yet; which place they greatly reue∣rence,
and suffer not any christiā to enter into y
e
 same.






23. THE SEPVLCHER OF STEPHEN,


 the first
Martyr; of 
Nichodemus,
 and of 
Gamaliel,
 Paules
schoolemaister.






24. THE TABERNACLE OF SION,


 couered
with skinnes which king Dauid made,
 and placed
the same in the little hil of Mount Sion which is called

Gabaon,
 and with great reuerence he put the Arke of
God therein,
 and appointed priests and Leuites con∣tinuallie
to Minister from day to day by turne, which


remained there twenty and foure yeares,
 vntill it was
carried by 
Salomon
 into the temple. In the same, Da∣uid
sorrowing for his adultery with 
Bethsabe,
 and mur∣der
of 
Vrias,
 made certeine psalmes of repentance.






25. THE KINGS PRESSES,


 wherein the kings wine
was pressed.








THE SECOND PART OF
THE CITTIE.


26. 
T
HE DAVGHTER OF SION,


 so
called,
 because it seemed to growe
from mount 
Sion,
 the which was
also called the lower citty, beeyng
another part of the cittie, whereof
there is often mention made in the
holy scriptures and in 
Iosephus.






THE PLACES OF THE DAVGH∣TER
OF SION.




27. THE MOVNTAINE OF ACRA,


 was some∣time
in the lower cittie verie loftie and steepe, the
heighth whereof afterward 
Simon Machabaeus
 abated
and made plaine by the continuall labour of the peo∣ple,
which he imployed heerein by the space of three
yeares day and night, that the Temple alone might be
higher then all other places of the cittie.








28. THE AMPHITHEATER,


 that is a place inuiro∣ned
with scaffoldes and stages, capable of foure∣score
thousand men, where the people were woont
to behold their games, which 
Herod
 the elder first of
all other builded in the field at Ierusalem with great la∣bour
and cost. Wherein, to recreate the beholders,
wrastlers and sword players, shewed many feates of
actiuitie: and sometimes, Lyons, Leopardes, Bulles,
Beares, Bores, Wolues, and other exceeding wilde
and fierce beasts, fought one with another, and some∣time
condemned men were cast vnto these to bee de∣uoured,
and captiues taken in warre. At which time
of their games, the place beneath was strowed with
sand, to the end that neither the sword players should
faile in their footing, nor the fighters might bee defi∣led
with the bloud of the slain, nor yet that the sprink∣ling
of the bloud shoulde bring horror to the lookers
on.






29. THE CASTLE ANTONIA,


 strong and wel for∣tified,

lying neere to the North side of the Temple,
which was builded in time past on a high rocke fiftie
cubits high,
 and very steepe round about, and the to∣wer
was called 
Baris.
 In this the chiefe priests which
came of the 
Machabees
 euen till 
Herods
 time inhabi∣ted:
where in a Cell made for that purpose, the sacred
stole of the chiefe priest was kept, the gouernour of
the Tower lighting a candle there euery day. 
Herod

the greater hauing gotten the kingdome, and seeing
that this castle was conueniently scituat to command
the Cittisens; that they might not seeke innouation


through sedition, repaired the same to his greate cost,
and fortified it within with a roiall pallace, euen like a
cittie, and with fower loftie towers at each corner,
whereof three were fiftye cubits hie, and the fourth
threescore and ten, from whence the whole temple
might be seene: and for the fauour which hee bare to

Marcus Antonius
 his frend, he called it ANTONIA
In this castle the Romaine soldiors, kepte alwaies
watch with their soldiors, hauing an eie and princi∣pall
care least the people should worke any innoua∣tion
in the Temple on the feast daies. And so the
Temple belonged to the cittie, and the castle 
Antonia

to the temple.






30. THE COVRTE OF RECORDES,


which wee
commonly call the courte of 
Chauncery,
 or of the

Roules:
 that is to say, a house wherein the act of the cit∣tie,
and of the cittizens, and also their publike records,
and the accoumpt of creditors were kepte:
 the which
the seditious burned, the keepers thereof flying from
thence to the end they might destroy all the euidence
of the creditors, and ioyne vnto them all the det∣ters.






31. THE CASTLE OF ANTIOCHVS EPIPHA∣NIS,



both high and strong, the which, after the
slaughter of many cittizens,
 the spoile of the cittye
and temple,
 and the burning of most faire houses, he
builded vppon the mountaine 
Acra,
 and fortified it
with stronge walles and towers, and placed a Garri∣son
of 
Macidonian
 soldiers there mingling with them
certaine of the most raschall fugitiue Iewes, by whom
the continual sacrifice was taken away by the space of


three yeares and the citty it selfe vexed more then six
and twentie yeares. But after this 
Simon Machabaeus

wan and destroied this castle.






32. THE COMMON PRISON OF THE CITTIE,



wherein the Apostles being shut vppe,
 by the rulers
of the Iewes, were in the night time brought forth by
the angell. 
Iosephus
 seemeth to cal this prison 
Betiso.






33 THE CORNER PARLOVR,


 belonging to the
corner house, where the publike suppers were kept.






34. THE VAVLTED CAVE,


leading from the castle

Antonia
 into the Temple,
 which 
Herod
 the elder
made, setting a tower thereon,
 that by the same hee
might passe priuilie into the temple,
 if so bee the peo∣ple
intended to make any insurrection against the K.
the which remaineth as yet very wonderfull & large,
insomuch that six hundred horses may verie conueni∣ently
be placed therein.






35 THE COVRT,


 In Hebrew called 
Gasith.
 Which
in the inner cittie was ioyned to an olde wal there∣of.

Wherein were three score and tenne Senatours
and ordinary Iudges,
 which were called of the Iewes

Sanhedrim,
 in Greeke 
Synedrium,
 that is to saye in
English,
 The counsell of the Elders, and 
Seniors
 of
the people.
 These dealt in the affaires of the com∣mon
wealth, gaue Lawes, and determined the doubt∣full
and weightie causes, yea euen of other Citties


also, they ended strifes and controuersies, and gaue
the sentence of death,
 generally they dealt in all capi∣tall
causes, except onely in the difficulties and miste∣ries
of Gods Lawe and of the Iewes Religion, the
which the priestes onely determined. In this consi∣storie
the Apostles were examined,
 whipped, and
forbidden to preach, and yet went reioysing from the
Councell, because they were counted worthy to suf∣fer
shame for the name of Iesus.
 Heere it was that
Saint 
Stephen
 standing before the Councell, and his
countenance shining like an Aungell, lifting vppe
his eies, sawe the Heauens open, and the glorie of
God, and Iesus standing at the right hande of GOD,
from thence hee being cast with violence out of the
Citty, was stoned.






36 THE HOVSE OF ANANIAS THE HIGH PRIEST,


 which the seditious at y
e
 length fiered.






37. THE HOVSE OF SAINT ANNE,


 the Gran∣dame
of Christ,
 wherein she with 
Ioacim
 her hus∣band
abode when the feast was at Ierusalem, where
they both died.
 Heere the blessed virgine Mary was
conceiued (as some coniecture) and aboad there du∣ring
the passion of Christ.






38 THE HOVSE OF THE RICH GLVTTON,



which burneth in hel according to the Euangeli∣call
storie.
 In the which house that he dwelt,
 it is re∣ported
by some antiquities,
 a high wall whereof is
shewed at this day to Christian trauellers.








39. THE HOVSE OF MISSA,


 whereof mencion
is made in the fourth booke of Kings.






40 THE HOVSE OF THE NATHINAEANS,



which carried wood and water into the Temple.






41. THE HOVSE OF THE PRINCE OF THE PHARISEIES,


 in the which Christ touched the
man sicke of the dropsie and healed him.






42. THE HOVSE OF THE FORREST OF LY∣BANVS,



in length one hundred cubits,
 in breadth
fiftie,
 and in heigth thirtie cubits: the which Salomon
builded most braue and glorious of polished marble,

of Cedar trees, garnished with siluer and gold, hauing
a flat roofe with walkes and galleries: (according to
the fashion of 
Palestine
) and within liuely counter∣feits
of sundry trees and plants most artificially made,

that the leaues thereof seemed in some sort to shake.
And neere vnto the same hee planted a groue and a
greene arbor,
 made of all manner of trees, and wate∣red
with fountaines: also hee made parkes and fishe
pooles, wherein it is like were all manner of wilde
beastes, birds, and fishes. This house was a storehouse
of meate, an armorie for weapons of warre, a house
wherein ointments, paintings, and sweete perfumes
were laied vppe and preserued. Beside these, two hun∣dred
shields of golde for horssemen, and three hun∣dred
large targets of golde for footemen which Sa∣lomon


made, were in this house by him laide vppe.
Al other vessels also of this house, were of gold. To this
house the king and his peeres came when the weigh∣tie
affaires of the Common wealth were ended, and
recreated their mindes, with banquets, with plaies,
and with pleasant walkes.






43 THE HOVSE OF SIMON THE PHARISIE



which is at this day to bee seene:
 wherein Christ
sitting at the Table, forgaue vnto 
Mary Magdalen

the sinfull woman (bewailing her sinnes, and washing
his feet with her teares, wiping them with her haire,
kissing them, annointing him, and much louing him)
many sinnes.






44 THE HOVSE OF THE COMMON PEOPTE



wherein they exercised themselues with dartinges
& other exercises of the arme,
 and with feastes, with
plaies and walkes refreshed their mindes.






45 THE GREAT MARKET,


 which was in the midst
of the cittie, and neere adioyning to the Castle
Antonia,
 wherein Alexander the king of the Iewes,
and the chiefe priest, crucified eight hundred Iewes,
killing also the Wiues in the presence of their hus∣bands,
and the children in the sight of their mothers:
the which spectacle himselfe with his Concubines
beheld, at what time they were banqueting in the ca∣stle
Antonia. For the which crueltie he was sirnamed

Crucida.
 In the same market place, 
Herod
 the greater,
fought a great battell with the 
Parthians,
 which went


about to bring againe 
Antigonus
 into the kingdom.

Furthermore when the famine through the Romane
siege was exceeding great in Ierusalem, in such wife
that it consumed whole families, and replenished the
toppes of houses with fainting women and children,
and the waies with the dead carcases of olde men (in
which extremitie they did eate leather, their girdles,
their shooes, hay, and mothers, their owne children)
then a man might haue seene lusty yoong men which
afore time were most flourishing, passe through this
market place, like shadowes of dead men. And when
those which remained aliue, were not able to burie
the dead, by reason of theyr exceeding multitude, and
could not endure the stinke of the bodies vnburied,
they cast them ouer the wall into the vallies of the cit∣tie.
The which when 
Titus
 sawe as hee went about
the wals, full of dead bodies much putrified, he fetcht
a great sigh, and houlding vppe his handes to GOD,
protested that it was not his deed, for the obstinate
Iewes refused peace, to them often times offered.






46. THE MARKET OF WARES,


the which was in
the vpper part of the lower cittie,
 in the which,
 fish
and sundry other things were folde. In this market S.

Iames
 the greater,
 the brother of 
Iohn,
 suffered his
martyrdome by the tyranny of 
Herod Agrippa.






47. THE VPHOLSTERS MARKET,


 wherein all ma∣ner
of olde garments that had beene worne afore∣time
of others, were to be sold.








48. THE SCHOLE OF GENTILLITIE,


 which Ie∣sus,
the false high priest of the Iewes (who after the
manner of the Gentiles would be called 
Iason
) and o∣ther
Iewes 
apostatas,
 by the permission of 
Antiochus
Epiphan,
 set vp euen vnder his castle oueragainst the
temple: wherein the people were taught the lawes
and fashions of the Gentils, & the youth instructed in
the studies and disputations of the Greeke philoso∣phers.
Where they being naked and annoynted with
oile, exercised themselues in feates of actiuity, in mar∣tiall
actions, and in enterludes. Furthermore in the
same place, the sayde 
Apostatas
 set vp EBHEBIAM,
that is to say a 
Stewes
 of faire young boyes, wherein
they committed most filthie thinges against nature,
By reason thereof many fell from the lawe of God, to
the manners and abhominations of the Gentiles, be∣ing
as it were sould to commit monstrous wickednes:
insomuch that some of the priests forsaking the tem∣ple
and worship of God, gaue themselues to the ex∣ercise
of feats of actiuity: here hence also there sprang
vp among the Iewes diuers sects, namely the 
Phari∣sies,

the 
Saduceis,
 the 
Esseies
 &c.






49 THE HOVSES OF THE PRIESTES,


 and of the
Leuites whose houses were shut vp by the out∣ward
parte of the wall: but from the former parte they
had a prospect toward the temple.






50 THE HABITATION OF THE TARGET BEARERS,


 was builded before the west gate of the


temple:
 where first the Iewes,
 then the Romaine sol∣diors,
vpon the solemne feast days had the stations for
the guarde of the temple.






51 THE LYSTES,


 OR TYLT, which was placed
oueragainst the South parte of the Temple, where∣in
horsses, by running, agillitie, and swiftnesse were
exercised. And the wrastlers and champions did con∣tend
before the people, who should rnnne swiftest on
foot, with chariots diuersly drawne, who shoulde
breake most speares, and in other masteries, and feares
of valiencie. Where 
Herod
 the kinge for the honour
of 
Augustus Caesar
 ordeined the game and prise, of
fiue yeares continuance; appointing vnto the victors
greate rewards. the same 
Herod
 when he should die,
called all the more noble sorte of the Iewes of al places
within his dominion, by an 
Edict
 threatning death to
such as should not obey, and caused them to be shut
vp in the 
Lystes,
 to the ende that after his death they
all being there slaine, euery house might haue cause to
waile euen in despight of all 
Iudaea.






52. THE MOVNTAINE MORIA,


the which in
another place is called the lande of vision,
 and the
mountaine of the temple,
 and the mountaine of the
daughter of 
Sion,
 lying neere vnto the easte wall of
the cittie,
 being very high, stoany, and very steepe
rounde about.
 In this mountaine 
Abraham
 being
ready to offer vp his sonne 
Isaac,
 in steede of him offe∣red
vp a Ramme which was taken, by the hornes in a
thicket. This was the very same mountaine which
Dauid bought of 
Streuna
 or 
Ornan
 the 
Iebusite
 for six
hundred sicles of goulde: and erecting an alter in his


threshing flower, he offered a burnt offering vnto the
Lorde,
 which the fire from heauen consumed. After∣ward
in the same mountaine Salomon builded vnto
the Lorde a moste excellent Temple both for large∣nesse
and bewtie; whereof mention shalbe made here∣after.






53. THE FIRST WALL,


 the which was called the
olde wall, both in regard of the valleis, and a hill
which was alofte aboue them, and also in regarde of
threescore towers whereinto it was deuided, the
which made it very defensible and strong.






54. OPHEL,


 which 
Iosephus
 calleth 
Ophlam,
 was a tow∣er
of an exceeding height, whose top seemed to
rech vnto the cloudes; it was fortified with a castle,
and compassed about with a firme wal, neere vnto the
Temple, notwithstanding it was without the wall,
which shut off the habitation of the priests. Here∣in
dwelte the 
Nathenims.
 Into this 
Manahemus
 the
tyrant flying, was taken and slaine. This same was at
the last burned by the soldiors of 
Titus.






55. THE PALLACE OF THE MACHABEES,



builded by them on a very loftie place on the weste
side of the Temple,
 from whence they which would
behoulde the cittye and those things which were don
therein,
 had a most pleasant and delectable prospect.
The which kinge 
Agrippa
 afterward excedingly
enlarged and made it a Courte for himselfe: from


whence out of his parlour hee might behold whatso∣euer
was donne in the temple. For the which cause the
rulers of the Iewes builded a very high gate betwene
that and the weste part of the inner Temple, to hinder
the kings prospect. This thing both kinge 
Agrippa,

and 
Festus
 also the Lieutenant of the country tooke
in very euill parte, who also commanded them to pull
downe the sayde gate. But the rulers intreated, that
they might haue leaue to send ambassadors to 
Nero

the emperour concerning this matter, saying that
they could not liue if any thinge were casted downe of
the buildings of the temple. The which liberty when
they had obtained; they sent 
Ismaell
 the cheefe priest,
and 
Helchia
 the treasurer, and with them ten of their
chiefe rulers. And 
Nero
 at the earnest sute of 
Poppea

his wife, a godly woman, which shee made for the
Iewes, pardoned the building of the saide gate, and
permitted the same so to stand.






56. THE PALLACE OF PILATE,


 and of the
Lieutenants of Rome, adioyning to the Gallerie,
which lieth on the North side of the castle 
Anto∣nia:

which pallace,
 was much more large, loftie,
and fayrer,
 then all the buildinges of the cittye, and
had an ascend or mounting,
 of twenty and eight steps
of Marble.


Here when Christe was falsely accused, and re∣quired
to bee crucified, by the princes and people
of the Iewes, for (that as they sayde) hee peruerted
the people, forbad tribute to be giuen to 
Caesar,
 sayde
that he was 
Christ
 a King, and therfore approued him
selfe a seditious person, 
Pilate
 condemned him to be
whipped vnder the forme of this sentence▪ which was


found in a most ancient chronicle,
 as followeth, 
Iesum
Nazarenum virum sediciosum, et Mosaicae legis con∣temptorem,
per pontifices et principes suae gentis accusa∣tum,
expoliate, ligate, et virgis caedite.
 That is to saye,

Take ye Iesus of Nazareth accused by the chiefe priestes
and rulers of his owne Nation to bee a man sedicious,
and a contemner of Moses Lawe, strip him, binde him,
and whyp him.
 Whereupon the soldiors of 
Pilate
 led
him into the Iudgement haule, stript him before the
whole band of soldiors and other people, tied him to
a piller, beate him most cruelly with roddes, and rent
and tare his most tender body. After this, they put
on him a purple robe, platted and in forcible manner,
broided on his head a crowne of sharpe thornes, de∣liuered
into his right hand a reede, and in scorne salu∣ted
him as a kinge bending the knee before him, ma∣ny
waies mocked him, they did spit on him, they did
buffet him, and strike him vpon the wounded heade
with a reede.






57 THE QVEENES PALLACE,


 which 
Salomon

most royally builded of precious and polished stones,

for the habitation of his wife which was 
Pharaos

daughter.






58 SALOMONS PALLACE,


 exceeding greate
and fayre, the which hee builded in thirtene yeares
magnificently and moste sumptuously on the south
parte of the mount 
Moria,
 of bright marble, and ce∣dar
trees, supported with many pillers, for his owne
habitation: this he wonderfully garnished with gold
and siluer round about, and made all the vessels there∣of
of gold. In the same place afterward, the Christian


kings of 
Ierusalem
 had their pallace, where first began
the order of the 
Templers.






59 THE CASTLE PISAN,


 compassed about with
deep trenches, & towers; the which was builded
on the west part of the cittie, by the Christian inhabi∣tants
of a towne in 
Italie
 belonging to the 
Pisans,
 at
what time they had the dominion of the holy lande.
Where first the 
Pisans,
 after them the 
Saracens,
 and
now the Turkes, do exact of the pilgrims of the holy
land sacrilegious tribute.






60 THE INNER FOVNTAINE,


 which king 
Eze∣chias

made in the midst of the cittie at the North
side of the temple.
 For he brought into the cittie the
waters of this fountaine,
 from the higher fountaine of

Gition,
 by conduct pipes which were vnder the earth,
and made them to issue forth in this fountaine. This
fountaine he compassed about with a wel to water the
whole cittie, that the people in time of siege might
not be distressed with the want of water.






61 THE POOLE PROBATICA,


 that is to say y
e
 sheep
poole, wherein the sheepe and other beastes were
washed that were appointed for sacrifice. In Hebrue
it is called 
Bethesda,
 (and corruptly 
Bethsaida
) that is
to say, the house of effusion because the raine waters
ran into the same. It was situate betwene the gate of
the valley and the temple.
 It was the largest and most
principall poole or water of the whole cittie, hauing
fiue porches, which king Salomon made for the ser∣uice


of the Temple. And this 
Iosephus
 calleth Salo∣mons
lake or Poole. For in this poole the 
Nathe∣nims

washed the oblations which they deliuered vnto
the priests to be offered in the Temple. The Water
heereof was moued at certeine times by the Aungell
of the Lord, and who so after the stirring therof went
first into the water, he was healed, whatsoeuer disease
he had. And therefore there lay a great multitude of
languishing people in the porches thereof, as blinde,
lame, withered, waiting for the mouing of the water.
Among which number Christ healed a man which
had languished thirty and eight yeares.






62 THE OLD FOVNTAINE,


 together with a Ri∣uer,

which issuing out of the same runneth through
the whole Cittie into the brooke 
Cedron.






63 THE BRIDGE,


 and portch with gates, by which
men went from the gallerie,
 and from the Castle

Antonia,
 ouer the valley of 
Cedron
 into the Temple,
the which at the first the fauorites of 
Aristobolus
 a∣gainst

Pompei,
 and afterward the seditious against 
Flo∣rus,

cut off, least by the meanes of the Castle 
Anto∣nia,

the Temple should be gotten.






64 THE WARDERS GATE,


 so called, because cer∣teine
of the kings guard warded there, at such time
as the king entered into the Temple.








65 THE HORSE GATE,


 so named, because men
might ride so farre as that place: but then leauing
their horses, they went on foote into the temple. At
the which place began the habitations of the priests.






66. THE GATE OF THE ESSENS,


 was scituate in
the olde wall of the Citty.






67. THE FIRST GATE,


 whereof the Prophet 
Zacha∣rie

maketh mention.






68. THE PORCH OF PILLERS,


 scituate before Sa∣lomons
pallace, the which was fiftie cubites long,
and thirty cubites broad, and supported with strong
pillers.






69. THE BEAST MARKET,


 called 
Probatica,
 where
sheepe, oxen, and other beastes for sacrifice were
sold in the open market.






70 THE PALLACE OF QVEENE BERNICE,


 si∣ster
of king 
Agrippa,
 who with her brother at 
Cae∣saria

heard Paules supplication before 
Festus.
 And af∣terwards
paying her vowes to God at Ierusalem, shee
came bare foot before 
Florus
 sitting in his iudgement
seat tyranizing against the cittisens, whom she besee∣ched
in vaine as concerning them.








71. THE PALLACE OF GRAPTA,


 the neece of

Izata
 kinge of the 
Adiabens,
 which she built for her
selfe. Wherein afterward, 
Ihon
 the Captaine of the
seditious abiding, lefte there his mony and spoiles of
tyranny.






72. THE PALLACE OF HELEN,


 which exalted
it selfe in the middest of the mountaine 
Acra.
 She
being the Queene of the 
Adiabens
 which dwelt be∣yond

Euphrates,
 was conuerted from Gentilisme, to
the religion of the Iewes,
 and came to 
Ierusalem,
 to
dwell. Where she being become a Christian, at what
time that greate famine, (whereof 
Agabus
 prophesi∣ed)
in the dayes of the emperour 
Claudius,
 pinched
the whole world, but specially the land of 
Iudaea,
 this
good Queene (I say) at her proper costs and charge
sent for great store of corne out of Egypt which shee
distributed among the poore and needy at 
Ierusalem.






73. THE PALLACE OF MONOBAZ,


 kinge of 
A∣diabens,

the sonne of 
Helen,
 which was situat in the
easte parte of the cittie.








74. THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD,


 otherwise
called, the Lordes house and the sanctuary. The
which Salomon the peaceable kinge builded of the
matter prepared by Dauid his father, and of electe,
hewen, and pollished stones, and of timber cut from
mount 
Libanus,
 by the labour of more then a hun∣dred


fitie three thousand men in the mont 
Moria,

without any sound of axe or hammer, in seuen yeares,
so sumptuous and magnificent both within and with∣out
with shining gould, that it was counted the mira∣cle
of the world. Concerning the wonderfull excel∣lencie
whereof nothing can bee sufficiently spoken.
When Salomon dedicated this Temple, the cloude
and glory of the Lord filled it, & the fire which came
from heauen consumed the sacrifices which were of∣fered
therein. As concerning the enterance of this
temple, the same was contrary to the fashion now v∣sed,
being East-ward, and the backe part tended west;
whereuppon the priests, and people praied turning
to the west, and worshipped God herein with greate
reuerence, vntill through the Impietie of the kinges
and people of the Iewes,
 it was prophaned with the
pollusions of Idols often times.
 Therefore foure hun∣dred
fortie and one yeares after the firste foundation
thereof, by the iust iudgement of God, 
Nabuchodo∣nozer

kinge of 
Babilon
 burnt the same, and so destroi∣ed
it,
 that it lay desolate threescore and tenne yeares.
But after that,
 
Zorobabell
 repaired the temple againe
in excellent sorte with squared stones,
 and the beste
timber in the same mountaine, within the space of
forty and six yeares.
 And this also was of so great esti∣mation
that it was honoured throughout the whole
world, and was from all partes enriched and bewtified
with the greatest gifts and honors of kings and prin∣ces.
The which after three hundred, fiftie, and fower
yeares, was spoiled by 
Antiochus Epiphan
 king of 
Sy∣ria,

and polluted with Idols. In the third yeare of the
contamination thereof, the most valiant Captaine of
the Iewes 
Iudas Machaboeus,
 purged it, and restored
to the same againe, the goulden vessels, and the wor∣ship
of God. And that it might neuer more be defiled,


he did waule it about in manner of a castle with deepe
trenches,
 with strong and high walles, and with gates
and towers both forceable and faire.


Wherein hee being beseeged a long time with one
hundred and twentie thousand Gentils, coulde not
be commaunded.


But aboute one hundred yeare after this when
that famous Captaine of the Romaines 
Pompei
 the
greate foughte against it,
 hee wanne it with maine
force,
 and in the entering thereof hee slue therein
twelue thousande Iewes; and 
Pompei
 himselfe with
his peeres entring into the moste holye place, and
behoulding the Table, the Candlesticke, and other
thinges there, of shining goulde, and finding also
two thousand talents of the holy treasure, this hea∣then
Prince mooued as it were with a certayne god∣linesse,
woulde not so muche as touch any of them
but the nexte daye after the siege commuanded the
keepers of the temple to clense the same, and to ce∣lebreate
their lawfull and solemne sacrifices. This
selfe and same temple being afterwardes decayed,

Herod
 the 
Ascalonit
 kinge of the Iewes, by the space
of nyne yeares and a halfe, repaired and bewtified it,
with sumptuous buildings.


And according to the prophesie of the prophet

Aggei
 (euen as the Church is preferred before a
Sinagogue,
 and the bloud of the gospell is more pre∣cious
then the golde of the lawe) greater was the glo∣ry
of this second temple,
 then was that of the firste:
because Christe,
 with his presence, doctrine and
miracles,
 glorified this. For in this, when hee
was a childe hee was offered. In this hee sate in the
middest of the doctors; In the pinacle of this Tem∣ple
hee was tempted of the Diuel, when he fasted for∣tie


dayes and forty nights. In this likewise he prea∣ched
often times, and was vexed by the Iewes. All
which thinges, as they make muche for the glory
of the temple, so they did nothing auayle, but that
the very same Temple, in the yeare from the foun∣dation
thereof vnder 
Zorobabell
 fiue hundred eigh∣tie
and sixe, by the armye of 
Titus Caesar,
 after a
doubtful and bloudie battaile,
 was wonne with great
force and violence, and so greate a slaughter of Iewes
made aboute the alter for burnt offerings, that the
bloude of the slayne ranne like a riuer by the stayres
of the Temple: and the Temple it selfe in the firste
brunte and furie of the battaile was sette on fiere, by
a certayne soldior, moued by diuine motion, not
attending to the commaund of any, euen without
the Emperours consent: And by this burning, a
worke of al that euer was seene or heard of, the most
wonderfull, and the ornament of the whole worlde,
the tenth daye of the moneth of August,
 was consu∣med
into ashes: to witte, euen the very same day and
moneth, whereon aforetime the temple was burnt
by the 
Babilonians.


Yet for all this after threescore and fiue yeares,
the Iewes rebelling agayne, and going aboute to
restore the Temple in the same place where it was
afore, 
AElius Adrian
 the Emperour, slue of
them in one daye fiue hundred and foure score thou∣sande,
and vtterly rased the reste of the buildinges
of 
Ierusalem,
 and leueled the mountaine 
Moria

whereon the Temple was builded, and made it
euen, casting the rubbish and earthe thereof into
the vale 
Iosaphat,
 and into the brooke 
Cedron,

lefte the citty trusting to the defence of the moun∣taine
and Temple, shoulde rise vppe and rebell any


more against the Romaines. He wasted also with fire
and sword nine hundred and foure score villages. But
the emperour 
Iulian
 the 
Apostata,
 after two hundred
and twenty seuen yeares, to make the oracle of Christ
false,
 which he had prophesied concerning the tem∣ple
that there should not bee lefte one stone vppon
another,
 gaue vnto the Iewes money out of the com∣mon
treasurie, and commanded them to build a new
the temple and to sacrifice there according to the law
of 
Moses.


The Iewes glad of this, came from all partes of the
world to 
Ierusalem,
 and threatning greuous things a∣gainst
the Christians,
 they prepared & got vnto them
skilfull workemen, stones, timber, morter, and all
other things necessary for the building: also they cau∣sed
to be made siluer mattockes, spades, and baskets:
and throughly purged the place where the Temple
stoode, with such speede and willingnesse, that their
women also bestowed all their ouches, taches, bru∣ches,
and other Iewells, for the building, and caried
out from that place all the rubbish in their laps. And
when the foundations were opened and clensed, the
day following they should haue begun their founda∣tion,
but the same night there came such an excee∣ding
and vehement tempest, that it caried away and
scattered abroade their stone, timber, and morter,
with other their necessaries. Ouer and besides this, a
greate earthquake, shooke all the stones of the olde
foundations of the temple and dispersed them, disor∣dered
the houses nexte adioyning to the temple by a
downefall, and killed many Iewes.


And when they which remained, in the morning
enterprised againe to build; a fier falling from heauen,
a flame also breaking foorth from the foundations of
the temple, destroyed more Iewes then before, which


either were busy about the worke, or which came thi∣ther
to see and looke on: and all that daye burnt and
consumed into ashes, their maules, hammers, axes,
spades, and all other working tooles, that nothing
was left. The Iewes being yet obstinately bent, the
next night following, a bright signe of the crosse ap∣peared
in heauen, and the garments of all the Iewes
were marked as it were from heauen with figures of
the crosse, and replenished therewith as the firma∣ment
with starres; which when the day appeared they
seeking to put out, could not by any manner of means
do it. And thus being astonished and confounded,
they lefte off both their vaine enterprise and also the
place. So that by their wicked endeuour, the diuine
oracle, was not only not made frustrate, but also more
fulfilled and confirmed.


The Iewes being in this sorte beaten from their en∣terprise,
the Christians neuerthelesse were not afeard
to build in the same place. For they erected a temple
there in a round forme, made of greate hewen, and
pollished stones, couered with a leaden roofe, very
large high and bewtifull to behold. The which in
processe of time, was honored with the Patriarchall
seate, and became famous by reason of the true and
pure worship of God which was therein maintayned.

At the length being inuaded by the 
Saracens,
 it was
contaminated foure hundred threescore and three
yeares, with the filthy worship of 
Mahomet.
 Finally
in the yeare of Christ,
 1099. the very same temple,

though it was fortified with a wall, with towers, and
with strong gates by the Christians, yet was it violent∣ly
wonne by 
Godfrey
 of 
Bullion,
 a valeant man; who kil∣led
within the circuit of the temple, ten thousand 
Sa∣racens,

in such wise that the vpper face of the earth
was couered with the bloud of the slayne. In the


which place the saide 
Godfrey
 erected a Colledge of
diuine seruice, giuing continuall maintenaunc to the
same, furnishing it with necessary habitations, which
so continued by the space of foure score and eighte
yeares. The which expired, the same was possessed
againe by the 
Saracens,
 through the pernicious dis∣corde
of Christian princes: who in the toppe there∣of,
(according to their manner) sette vp the figure of
the halfe moone: and in the courts thereof they plan∣ted
figges, and oliue trees. The same being nowe
possessed of the 
Turkes,
 is defiled with the detestable
worship of 
Mahomet.
 And all Christians are com∣manded
by an 
Edict,
 not to enter thereinto, vppon
paine of death. For if any Christian bee knowne to
haue entered therein, hee is by and by either com∣pelled
solemnely to deny the faith of Christe, or else
publiquely to lose his head.






THE FIRST PARTE OF
THE TEMPLE.




75. 
T
HE HOLY OF HOLYEST,


 the
which is so called bicause of the
singuler holinesse of the place.
 It
is also named the 
Oracle,
 and the

Inner house.
 For it was the se∣cretest
part of the temple,
 wherein∣to
fewe did come: being twentie
cubits longe, and as many in bredth; the heighte
whereof was one hundred and twenty cubits. Whose


floore was paued with marble,
 and layde ouer with
firre boardes,
 couered with plate of golde. The gates
were made of polished stones inwardely framed with
boordes of cedar, and couered with golden plates: the
which being fastened with nailes of golde shined most
gloriously, as if it had beene a diuine worke. Where∣on
were grauen Cherubims, pretious stones, palmes,
flowers, Imbosements, and pictures of diuerse sortes,
representing the celestiall bewty. The roofe also was
couered with golden plate, the very top whereof was
sette full of goulden prickets, or sharpe spittes to fraie
away birdes, leste by sitting thereon, it mighte bee
polluted. Into this sacred holy of holyest, the chiefe
Prieste, for the diuine maiesty thereof, entred but
once euery yeare alone,
 in the feast of purgation: on
which daye the Iewes did fast and afflict themselues.
And then that greate and chief priest of God, prefi∣guring
the person of Christe, offered the bloude of a
calfe burnte without the hoast, for his owne sinnes,
and for the sinnes of the people. Who if he weare but
somuch as in sleepe polluted, entred not in in his own
person, but by his substituted vicar.








THE PARTES OF THE
MOST HOLY PLACEs.




76. THE ARKE OF THE COVENANT,


 the which
by the commaundement of God was made of 
Se∣thim

wood,
 which corrupteth not,
 by 
Moses
 in the
deserte, couered within and without with plate of
pure goulde, being sette in the middest of the holy of


holiest,
 shining like the sun with the glittering bright∣nesse
of golde.
 Whose surpassing bewtie is rather to
be wondred at, then with words to be expressed. In
this Arke the two tables of stone, containing the ten
commaundements written with the finger of God,
were kept with a singular care and holinesse: also the
Pot wherein was 
Manna:
 and 
Aarons
 florishing rod,
and the booke of 
Deuteronomy.
 The Arke abode in
this place about foure hundred and thirty yeares.
 It is
written in the book of the 
Machabees,
 y
t
 in the time of
the captiuity of 
Babilon,
 the Prophet 
Ieremy
 by the
commandement of God, hid the same priuily together
with the Alter of Incense, and the perpetuall fier, in a
caue of the mount 
Nebo.


But the 
Hebrues
 coniecture,
 that it was caried by

Nabuchodonozer
 into 
Babilon:
 & that it was neuer re∣turned
againe,
 but another made by the Iewes in
steade thereof after the returne from the captiuitie.

Other some thinke that 
Nabuchodonozer
 carried away
the same with fiue thousand and foure hundred ves∣sels
of siluer and golde,
 which belonged to the temple
of 
Ierusalem,
 and put them into the temple of 
Bell
 his
god,
 but preserued by Gods prouidence (as it was
sometime in 
Philistaea
) after threescore and ten yeares
of the captiuitie, they thinke (I say) that it was resto∣red
againe to the Iewes, at their returne by 
Cyrus,

together with the said vessels. But after the beseeging
of 
Ierusalem Titus
 and 
Vespasian,
 cariyng out of the
temple to 
Rome,
 the Arke of the couenant, the two
tables of the Lawe, with both the rods of 
Moses
 and

Aaron:
 also the goulden table, and some of the shew
bread: the goulden Candlestick also, and the foure pil∣lers;
made these to be caried among other spoiles, by
the Iewes themselues round about the cittie in an o∣pen
triumph, wherein with greate pompe they trium∣phed


ouer that nation: 
Simon Giora
 Captaine of the
seditious, and seuen hundred Iewes captiues (which
were selected from among the rest for youth and com¦lynesse)
going before the triumpher halfe naked, with
their hands bound. This triumph being ended 
Vespa∣sian,

layed vp all the vessels of 
Ierusalem,
 in the Tem∣ple
of 
Peace
 at 
Rome,
 which hee in moste sumptuous
manner had builded: But the lawe of the Iewes, and
the purple vailes of the most secret places, he com∣manded
to be safely layde vp in his pallace.






77. THE TWO CHERVBIMS,


 of glory, the which,
as it appeareth by the Hebrue text of 
Paralippome∣non,

are like vnto young boyes,
 made of the wood of
the oliue tree,
 ten cubits high, and couered with plates
of gold, and shining with angelicall brightnesse, stood
at each ende of the Arke with wings spred, one cou∣ple
couering the propitiatorie, and with the other
couple touching the gate on both sides: Whose fa∣ces
were directed toward the vttermost house: and
looking one towardes the other, they behelde both
themselues, and also the propitiatorie.






78. THE PROPITIATORIE,


otherwise also called the
oracle, the which being aboue the Arke, betwene
the wings of the two 
Cherubims,
 and shining with
most pure golde in brightnesse aboue the sunne, re∣presenting
the diuine maiesty, was as it were the seate
of God speaking: from whence he gaue oracles and
answeres.










THE SECOND PARTE OF
THE TEMPLE.




79. 
T
HE HOLIE PLACE,


 so cal∣led
for the dignitie of the place.
 It
was also called the 
Sanctuary,
 the
outwarde house of the Lorde,
 and
the priests Courte.
 This is the o∣ther
parte of the Temple, fortye
cubits longe,
 and twenty broade, in
highte one hundred and twenty cubits.
 The doores
hereof were of golde.
 The floore made of firre boards
was couered with plate of goulde.
 The gates were
made of polished stones, and beeing within lined
with boardes of 
Caedar,
 were couered outwardely with
plates of goulde. Whereon was grauen 
Cherubims

pretious stones, palmes, flowers, and sundry carued
workes and pictures, which wonderfullie delighted
men to behold. Aboue it was couered with a fayre
roofe, shining as if it had beene fier.


From the enterance hereinto, such as were not
cleane, were forbidden by the Lawe. Only the priests,
which Kinge Dauid reckened to the number of thirty
eight thousand, and distinguished them by Lot into
foure and twenty orders, entered dayly thereinto.


All which beeing without vice, according to

Dauids
 ordinance, wekely by turne, from Saboth to
Saboth abstayning from their wiues, from wine and
from all other stronge drincke, their priuities coue∣red
with linnen breeches, outwardely cloathed and


girded with a linnen garment, wearing a silke myter
on their heade, in a wonderfull order, and with the
greatest reuerence that coulde bee, they worship∣ped
God, they offered sacrifices and made their prai∣ers.






80. THE ALTER OF INCENSE,


 of gould,
 which
by Gods commaundement was placed ouer a∣gainste
the vaile hanging before the most holy place,

called the holye of holyest: Whereon the Priestes,

euery daye morning and euening offered vnto God
for a sweete sauour, Frankenscence and sweete per∣fumes.
The angell Gabriell standing sometime at
the righte hande of this alter, toulde vnto 
Zachary,

as hee was offering Incense, the conception of 
Iohn
Baptist.






81. THE GOVLDEN CANDELSTICKE,


the
which hauing seuen branches,
 and so many Can∣dles,
was placed on the South side of the Temple:
the which being lamps of most pure oile,
 burned con∣tinually,
and gaue light as well by day as by night,
 to
all the holy place.






82. THE FOVNTAYN,


 of water which issued forth on
y
e
 right side of the temple the water wherof 
Salomō

deriued into the sea of bras,
 and into the copper 
Lauer:

the which being carried from thence by Conduit
pipes vnder the earth breking forth halfe a mile from


the east side of the citrie ranne into the brooke Ce∣dron.






83. THE GOVLDEN TABLE,


 the which stood on
the North side of the temple,
 whereon were sette
twelue loaues made of the most pure and fine flower
of wheate.
 The which being stale,
 remayned to the
vse of the priests,
 and then new were supplyed againe
euery Saboth day, vppon the which were layde two
golden cups full of Frankensence.






84. THE CHEFE PRIESTE


his Image,
 and holy ap∣parell,

euery parte whereof shewe forth vnto vs, a
diuine and heauenly magnificence. For when he went
to offer sacrifice, or to enter into the most holy place
he put on not only the vnder garments spoken of be∣fore
vnder the nūber seuenty nyne, but also aboue vp¦pon
them a 
Tunicle
 of 
Iacinct
 with sleues downe to
the ankells, at the lower hem wherof there did hang
threescore and two golden bells, and in another bor∣der
as many pomegranats. The 
Tunicle
 was girt with
a girdle foure fingers broad, wouen with silke, gould,
precious stones, and flowers of sundry colours. A∣loft
aboue this, he did wear an 
Ephod
 or 
Superhumeral,

that is to say, a most faire cloake, made of golde, of 
Ia∣cinct,

of purple, scarlet and of fine silke most curiously
wouen together, dazling of the eies by reason of y
e
 vari¦ety
& glittering brightnes of the colours and flowers.
Vpon each shoulder whereof there were seueral 
Onix
stones
 included in golde, which 
Iosephus
 calleth 
Sardo∣nichs:

in either of which stones six names of the chil∣dren
of 
Israell
 were grauen.


Beside these, he had the 
Reasonable
 of Iudgement,


which he caried vpon his brest, wherein was doctrine
and truth. The 
Reasonable
 was a square thing about
the bredth of a mans hand, wouen and made of golde,
lacinct, purple, scarlet, and fine silke, whereto were
fastened twelue precious stones of diuerse sortes, ha∣uing
ingrauen in them the names of the twelue sons
of 
Israell,
 according to the order of their natiuitie.
Moreouer on his head he ware a long rounde cap, in
forme of a Miter, made of Iacinct and fine silke; vpon
the front wherof was set a brooch of gold in forme of
a halfe gloabe, which figured the ineffectable name of
God, 
Tetragrammaton,
 with these foure Hebrue let∣ters

 theron ingrauē, setting forth by the won∣derfull
brightnesse thereof the excellencie of the di∣uine
maiestie: Also the golden Censer in his hand: by
which he offered vnto God the most fragrant odor of
Frankensence, is a parte of his ornaments.


Al which things as they are ful of misteries, so some
of them excelled the rest in diuine power. For that
stone which the high prieste did beare on his righte
shoulder, so often as he had pleased God with sacrifi∣ces,
did so wonderfully shine, that they which stoode
a greate way off might perceiue it. And (which is no
lesse wonderfull) the twelue stones which were on
the 
Reasonable,
 did foreshewe vnto them which went
to the warre, victorie.


For before the army should moue it selfe, there
came so great a brightnesse from them, that it gaue al
the people to vnderstand that God was present, and
that he would helpe all those that call vpon him. But
now God being angry with the wickednesse of his
kings, both the 
Reasonable
 and the 
Onix
 also haue cea∣sed
one hundred and fiue yeares before the natiuity of
Christ to giue their wonted shine and brightnesse.








85 THE VAILE,


 was wouen of Iacinct, purple, scarlet
and fine silcke in most bewtifull varietie; and was a∣dorned
with Cherubims and al manner of flowers im∣broydered
thereon,
 which hong at the gate before the
most holy place,
 and at the death of Christ was rente
from the top to the bottome euen in the midst,








THE THIRD PARTE OF
THE TEMPLE.


86 THE IEWES ILE


. The which also is called the 
En∣tery,

the 
Haule,
 the 
Holy Secular,
 & 
Salomons Porch,

being the thirde parte of the temple.
 Into the which
men wente vp by foure steppes.
 Whose pauement
checkered with marble of sundry sortes,
 was open to
the aier, and vncouered, and was compassed aboute
with a wall made with three degrees of stones of sūdry
colours. To the which were annexed greate porches,
broade, and aboue threescore and tenne cubits high,
born vp with marble pillers of single stones which wer
twenty fiue cubits high, the roofe couered with Ce∣dar.
The inset gates couered with golde, shined most
gloriously. And it had three high gates: whereof the
first tended toward the easte, the second towarde the
South, and the third toward the North: euery of the
which gates were shut with two siluer doores thirtie
cubits high, & fiftene broad: but the weste part had no
gate but was inclosed with a whole wall. And this was
called the Iewes 
Ile
 or 
Haule
 because only the Iewes


being cleane and chaste made their praiers there,
 and
heard the words of the law.
 In the which place,
 Christ
taught the people often times:
 and where the Iewes
would haue stoned him: and 
Peter
 when he had hea∣led
the lame man spake vnto the people: and conuer∣ted
fiue thousand men. Before this 
Haule
 inclosed
with alattice, there was a Table sette, containing this
lawe ingrauen with letters of Greeke and Latine, 
E∣uery
stranger that shall enter into the holy place shall dye.

And the 
Romaines
 had giuen authority to the Iewes
to put to death as wel 
Romaines
 as Iewes, which trans∣gressed
this law.






THE PARTES OF THE
IEWES ILE.




87 THE ALTER OF BVRNT OFFERINGE OF BRASSE,


 the which stoode in the midst of the Ile
open to the aier and vncouered.
 Wherein that perpe∣tuall
fier was dayely maintained by the putting to of
wood which fier in old time,
 the Lord sente downe
from heauen, when 
Aaron
 at the firste time offered sa∣crifice
in the desert. On the which altar, the priests eue¦ry
day morning and euening, burnte sundry sortes of
Male beastes which were cleane and without ble∣mish,
as Sheepe, Oxen, and Goates, turtels, Pigeons,
and such like, which were consumed with this holye
and perpetuall fier, for a burnte offering and Odor
of sweete fauour vnto the Lorde. But in the time
of the Captiuity of 
BABILON,
 this perpetuall
fier was hidden by the Priestes in a drye pitte or well


and being sought for by 
Neemia
 the priest,
 threescore
and ten yeares after the same, there could be no fier
found in that place, but a certaine thicke water which
by diuine power, at the praier of 
Neemia
 was sette on
fier.






88 BOOZ and IACHIN,


 two pillers of brasse of won∣derfull
beawty, thirtie two cubits high, whose cir∣cumference
or circuit comprehended twelue cubits,
which 
Salomon
 caused to be made artificially, and pla∣ced
them in the porch of the temple, one at the right
hand, which hee named 
Iachin,
 and the other at the
left hand which he called 
Booz.






89. THE LAVER OF BRASSE,


 a vessell of greate ca∣pascitie,
full of water, placed by 
Salomon
 on the
North side of the temple, whereon were carued the
pictures of cherubims, Lions, and Oxen. In this the
priests washed the beasts which should serue for burnt
offerings, which neuerthelesse were firste washed in
the sheepe poole called 
Probatica.






90 THE HOVSE OF COVNSEL,


 at the South side
of the temple, where was the assembly of the elders
of the people.






91 THE CLOSETS,


 or vesteries, were side houses, lōg,
broade, and high, like towers. In the which, the
Priests when they should enter into the holy place,
did put off their wollen garments, laying them vp till


the seruice was ended.
 Wherin also they did eate
the partes of the peace offerings.






92. THE SEA OF BRASSE,


 containing very greate
store of water,
 which 
Salomon
 made, and placed
on the South side of the temple,
 vpon twelue oxen of
brasse; wherein the priests entering into the temple to
serue at the alter, washed their hands and their feete.






93. THE NEW GATE,


 the which was in the Ile of
the temple toward the south where 
Ieremie
 fore∣shewing
that the citrie and temple should be destroi∣ed,
was taken. And where 
Baruch
 red before the peo∣ple
the prophesie of 
Ieremy.






94. THE HOLY GATE,


 otherwise called the brasen
gate, which being in the Inset parte of the temple,
opened toward the East: before the which 
Esdras
 red
the law of God before the people: and where the ru∣lers
of the Iewes, a long time after that, exhorted the
seditious vnto peace.






95. THE PORCH OF THE TEMPLE,


 builded by

Salomō
 before the 
Sanctuary,
 the which was twen∣ty
cubits long, and ten broade.






96. THE RINGES SEATE,


 the which was very loftie,
the which 
Salomon
 prepared for the kings.








97. THE LOFTES OF THE SINGERS,


where di∣uine
praises were songe with voice,
 and with di∣uers
instruments.






98. THE PLACE OF ZACHARIAS,


 where he was
stoned betweene the temple and the altar.






99. THE PLACE,


where the Iewes woulde haue sto∣ned
Christ.








THE FOVRTH PARTE OF
THE TEMPLE.


100 
T
HE ILE,


 which belonged to the
Gentiles,
 being also called the 
out
set Courte,
 which is the fourth part
of the temple, into the which men
ascended by many stares. Whose
inset space open to the aier paued
with al manner of bewtiful stones,
had foure excellent gates opening towards the foure
partes of the worlde, which were shut with dores of
brasse. This being a square porch much like a cloy∣ster,
vphoulden with pillers of Marble, & seeled ouer
with cedar, was thirtie cubits broade. The whole cir∣cuite


and compasse of which porch, was fiue hundred
paces. Into this Courte or porch all sortes of Iewes
and Gentiles might enter, both cleane and vncleane:
where vpon it was called the Courte of the Gentiles.
Here hence it was that Christ did caste out twise the
buiers and sellers: and suffered not any man to carry
somuche as a vessell through the same. Here hee
discharged the woman taken in adulterie. Here hee
taught often times. Here also the Iewes woulde haue
stoned him. Finally here it was that hee was glo∣rified
before the Gentiles with a voice from hea∣uen.






THE PARTES OF THE
COVRT OF THE GENTILES.




101 THE GOVLDEN EAGLE,


 was of great waigth,
sette vp by 
Herod
 the greater ouer the greatest gate
of the Temple,
 and was at the laste pulled downe by
the Iewes and cut in peeces, where vpon arose a great
tumult, and many were slaine.






102. THE TREASVRIE


;
 in Hebrue called 
Corban,
 a chest
wherein was offered and kepte suche money,
 as
serued for the necessaries of the sacrifices,
 for the su∣stentation
of the poore, and for the repairing of the
Temple. When 
Helidore,
 who was sente by the
kinge of the 
Syrians,
 soughte to take the spoyle of










this treasury,
 he was scourged by angels from heauen.
And when 
Pilate
 by the like temiretie would haue be∣stowed
this holy treasure for the bringing in of waters
he was let and hindred by a general vprore of the peo∣ple:

the which neuerthelesse the 
Romaines
 when they
had wonne the cittie tooke and caried way.
 Also we
reade that 
Lysimachus
 was slaine neer vnto this place:

Here it was that Christ taught himselfe to be the light
of the world,
 and sayd that he should be lifted vp vpon
the crosse by the Iewes.
 Christ sitting here,
 pronoun∣ced
that the poore widdow offering two mites,
 had
giuen more then all the rich.
 Ouer this treasurie, for
a monument of his aduerse fortune turned into pros∣peritie,
kinge 
Agrippa
 hanged vp that golden chayne,
which the Emperour 
Caius
 gaue vnto him: being e∣quall
in waight to that Iron chaine with the which his
hands were bound by the commandement of the em∣perour

Tiberius.






103. ACHAS DIALL,


 the king, which he made, wher∣in
the kinge 
Ezechias
 being sicke,
 for a signe of re∣couering
his health, the shadowe of the sunne by di∣uine
miracle, went backwards ten degrees.






104. THE NORTH GATE,


 whereof mencion is often
times made in the Scripture and in 
Iosephus.






105 THE SOVTH GATE,


 mentioned often times in
Scripture, and in 
Iosephus.








106 THE WEST GATE,


 the which also in the booke
of Cronicles,
 is called the gate of foundation.






107. THE EAST GATE,


the which also is called the
gate 
Sur,
 otherwise 
Seir:
 also the kinges gate, and
the 
Bewtifull
 gate:
 because of all the reste it was the
greatest,
 highest,
 and fairest: by which also there was
the principall enterance into the temple.
 This being
decayed was repaired by kinge 
Ioatham.
 And neere
vnto this gate the Apostle Peter, with his word, hea∣led
the man which was lame from his mothers womb
and sate there begging of almes.






108. THE TOWERS OF TROMPETORS,


 which
were erected alofte in the west corners of the tem∣ple.

In the tops whereof, the priests, wanting the vse
of belles, with two siluer trompets, called the people
vnto the temple. Frō thence also they tould the people
of Festiuall daies, of 
Sabboths,
 of fastes, and of solemne
feastes.






109


HERE Christe writing with his fingar on the groūd
made the accusers of the women taken in adultry
ashamed and set her free.






110 HERE


Christ making a whip of cordes, caste out the
buiers and sellers,
 together with their marchandis.




Thus far we haue spoken of the Temple, and of the partes
thereof: and now me will prosecute the other partes of
the daughter of Sion.






111. THE THEATER,


 the which was builded in forme
of a halfe circle by 
Herod
 the 
Ascalonite
 kinge of
the Iewes,
 neere vnto the pallace of the 
Machabees.

In the circuit whereof in Imagerie was sette foorth
the tittles,
 the victories, and spoiles, of 
Augustus
Caesar;
 shining with siluer and goulde: where the bet∣ter
and more worthy sorte sitting vppon stayres and
seates made round in compasse, and the rest standing
therein, behelde the players, and actors, and musi∣tians,
playing theire comedies and tragedies, and o∣ther
plaies.








THE PLACES OF THE
DAGHTER OF SION.




112 THE THROANE OF SALOMON


.
 It was a ve∣ry
great thron of 
Iuorie,
 couered ouer with shining
goulde,
 close and rounde in the toppe like a Iudge∣ment
seate, hauing sixe steppes or stayres, at eache
ende whereof were twelue Lyons set. In this throne
kinge 
Salomon
 sate, when hee heard the controuer∣sies
of the people, and pronounced Iudgement, and
capitall sentences, appointing lawes and statutes.


Herein also hee sate, when in royall manner hee
woulde shewe foorth his pompe,
 glory and Riches,
and when he intended to bestow vpon his faithful ser∣uants
rewardes.






113 THE PASSAGE


which Kinge 
Salomon
 made of
strong timber,
 to go from his pallace into the tem∣ple.






114. THE TRIBVNALL,


was a publique place, set be∣fore
the house of 
Pilate,
 and appointed for Iudge∣ment,

where the Lieutenants of 
Rome
 were wonte
to giue sentence,
 which in Greeke,
 was called LI∣THOSTROTOS,
that is, 
a place of pauement,
 and in
Hebrue, GABATHA: bicause it was highe and
loftie. 
Pilate
 sitting in this iudgement seate, and ha∣uing
good wil to free Iesus standing before him, tooke
water and washed his handes before the people, say∣ing,

I am innocent from the bloude of this iuste man.

But all the people crying out 
Crucifie him, Crucifie
him, his bloude bee on vs and on our children:
 and fur∣ther
laying treason to his charge in that hee made
himselfe a kinge, hee condemned Christ to the death
of the crosse, in this forme of wordes, euen as wee
founde them in certeine antiquities, from whence
we faithfully report them.


Iesum Nazarenum subuersorem Gentis, contempto∣rem
Caesaris, et falsum Messiam, vt maiorum suorum
testimonio probatum est, ducite ad communis supplicij
locum: et cum ludibrio Regiae maiestatis, in medio du∣orum
latronum cruci affigite. I lictor, expedi cruces.



That is to lay, carry ye to the place of common exe∣cution

Iesus
 of 
Nazareth,
 a subuerter of his nation, a
contemner of 
Caeser,
 and a false 
Messias,
 as is proued
by the testimony of the elders of his owne people, and
crucifie him betwene two theeues in reproch & scorn
of his kingly maiesty. Go hang-mā, & mak ready with
speede the crosses. The which sentence pronounced
he deliuered him to the soldiors to be crucified. Who
brought forth Iesus,
 depriued of all bewtie and comli∣nesse,
and more like to a leaper, then to himselfe, by
reason of the paines which they had laide on him, but
that he might bee knowne vnto the people, they put
on him againe his owne garmentes, and carieng his
crosse, with two theeues through the gate of Iudge∣ment,
to be crucified in mount 
Caluary.


Pilate
 sitting in this 
Tribunall
 seate in time of
an Insurrection for bestowing the holy treasures of
the temple,
 which were called 
Corban,
 gaue a se∣cret
signe to the soldiors which were priuilie armed
vnder their cloathes,
 that they should not vse swords
but clubs,
 to beate downe the tumultuous Iewes.
 By
which meanes many of them were slaine, many sore
wounded, and very many trodden vnder foote, euen
to death by their owne company in the tumult.


After this 
Florus
 the Lieutenant, sitting in the same
iudgement seate,
 caused many of the Noble men and
gentlemen of the Iewes, to be beaten and torne with
rods and whips, and to be fastened on crosses: who al∣so
caused many other massakers about the cittie, no∣thing
sparing neither women, children, nor sucking
babes. The which were certain beginnings of venge∣ance
taken by almighty God vpon the obstinat Iewes
for the shedding of the Innocent bloud of Christ.








115. THE TOWER OF STRATO,


 in Greeke called

Pyrgus Sratonis,
 situate betwene the castle 
Antonia

and the temple: it was a hollow & an obscure passage
where 
Antigonus
 was slaine by the soldiors of his
brother.






116 THE VALLY OF CEDRON,


 broad, deepe and
dark, which in manner of a ditch or trench compas¦sed
the temple round about. And because it was dis∣posed
after the fashion of a morter, it was called in He
brue 
Macthes,
 and in Latine 
Pila.
 This was so excee∣ding
deepe, that men could not looke down from the
roofe of the temple into the bottome therof but their
eies, would dazle and their heades seme to turne with
gidinesse.
 Herein Merchantes, and all sortes of
chapmen dwelled.
 Into this vally 
Iames
 the brother of
the Lorde, firste Bishop of 
Ierusalem,
 for professing
Iesus the sonne of God on the feaste of passeouer was
cast downe headlong from the battlementes of the
temple at the commandement of 
Anani
 a 
Saducei

chiefe prieste, and was immediately knockt on the
head with a fullers club, & was there buried nere vnto
the temple, his monument remaining there alonge
time after.






117 THE WAIE OF THE CROSSE,


by which
Christ hauing receiued his iudgement to be cruci∣fied,
went forward with painefull and bloudy steps to
mount 
Caluary.



For beginning at the Pallace of 
Pilate
 he made
sixe and twenty steppes (which make threescore and
fiue foote) vnto the place where the crosse was layde
vpon him.


From whence (all the cittye gazeing on him) ca∣rying
his crosse on his sore shoulders, hee came to∣wardes
the Weste, or rather North-weste, foure∣score
steppes, which make two hundred foote, to
the place, where men say, that hee fell downe vnder
his crosse.


From thence going forward, by threescore steppes
and three foote (which make a hundred fiftie and
three foote) hee came to the place where the blessed
virgin 
Marye
 with 
Iohn
 the Apostle mette with
him.
 And proceeding from hence by threescore
and eleuen steppes, and one foote and a halfe (which
make a hundred seuentie and nine foote) he came vn∣to
a certaine crosse way, where 
Simon
 of 
Ciren
 was
compelled to beare the hinder parte of the crosse with
Christ.


Taking his way hence by one hundred ninetie
and one steppes, and halfe a foote, (which commeth
to foure hundred and seuenty foote) hee came to the
place where a certayne woman mette with him. And
from thence going three hundred thirtie sixe steppes
and two foote, (which amounte to eighte hundred
fortie and two foote) hee came to the 
Iudiciarie
 gate
where once againe he fell with his crosse.


From thence hee ascending faintely a very heard
and stony way towardes the North, hee gained three
hundred forty and eighte steppes and two foote (the
summe eight hundred seuentye and two foote) which
broughte him vnto a two foulde way, where certaine
women weeping spake vnto him: And from hence


laboring forwarde threescore steppes and one and
halfe a foote, (which make foure hundred and foure
foote) hee fell downe the laste time, at the foote of
the mounte 
CALVARIE.
 From thence hee weari∣lie
and faintingly went forwarde eighteene steppes, or
fortie fiue foote to the place where the hange-men
drewe off his cloathes, where they gaue him to drinke
wine mixt with mirrh and gaule.


Then hee went on twelue steppes, or thirty foote
euen to the place where hee was nayled on the crosse
on mounte 
CALVARIE.
 So that from the Pallace
of 
Pilate,
 vnto the place where Iesus was crucified,
the distance is a thousande three hundered and seuen
steppes: or by another accoumpt, three thousand two
hundred sixtie and eight foot,


We haue made such exacte descripion and de∣monstration
of the way of the crosse (as also the way
of the Captiuity hereafter expressed vnder the num∣ber
of two hundred and seuen) to the ende that eue∣rie
Christian man, in all places, euen in the doores
of his house, or walking often times in his garden,
or being in a iourney, or in the Temple, either lying
in his bedde, may by the Imaginination of his minde
conceiue the like way, and with godly affection of the
hearte may meditate vpon the passion of Christ: the
which no doubt is both acceptable vnto God, and for
our owne soules health moste profitable as the holy
Scriptures, and the writinges of good men by their
often exhortations do testifie.








118. THE WAY OF ENTRANCE EOR THE HOR¦SES,



which was betwene the pallaces of 
Salomon,

and of the Queene.
 By which 
Athalia
 the Queene be∣ing
brought out of the horsse gate, was slaine in the
valley of the Brooke 
Cedron.






119 THE GALLERY,


made in forme of a stone bridge,
with many arches, extending it selfe with ample
largenesse ouer the common streete, adorned with o∣pen
walkes vppon the same. From the which there
was a passage from the pallace of 
Pilate,
 into the cast∣le
of 
Antonia,
 and so from thence into the Temple.
Frō this place, being very safe, y
e
 Lieutenants of Rome
were wont to speake vnto the people.
 Whereon 
Pi∣late

standing, exhibited 
Iesus
 to the Princes and peo∣ple
of the Iewes to bee looked on, being very soare
scourged, spit on, cloathed with a purple cloake, and
wearing a sharpe crowne of thornes vppon his head,

saying vnto them 
Behould the man;
 that he being thus
afflicted,
 they might haue compassion on him. But
they with confused voyces cried,
 
crucifie him, cruci∣fie
him.
 Whereas yet an arch of stone is to be seene,
and is shewed vnto straungers, with this Inscription:

Tolle, Tolle, crucifig
—the rest cannot be red, by reason
antiquitie hath worne it out. From this 
Gallery
 kinge

Agippa
 pronounced an eloquent oration to pacifie
the sedicious people, exhorting them to obay the 
Ro∣maines,
Iosephus
 maketh mention many times of this

Gallery.








120 THE CROSSE OF CHRIST,


which was layd on
his shoulder,
 was fiftene foote long, and eight foot
ouer, as we haue receiued by tradition of the elders.






121 HERE


it is sayd that Christ fell the first time vnder his
crosse.






122 HERE


also by tradition of some fathers,
 it is sayde,
that the blessed virgin Marye with 
Iohn
 and cer∣teine
godly women stoode,
 as Christe passed by with
his crosse.






123. CHRIST, being com to these two waies,


and being
wearied with the heauy burden of his cros,
 is said
to haue fallen.
 For the which cause,
 the soldiors and
Iewes,
 fearing that he would faint, before he could be
crucefied,
 tooke a certaine man comming out of the
country,
 named 
Simon
 of 
Cyren,
 and compelled him
to carry the crosse after Iesus.










THE THIRD PARTE OF THE CITTIE.


124 
T
HE SECOND CITTIE.


 This is
the thirde parte of the cittye,
 the
which also had many narrow waies
wherof mention is made somtime
in the Scripture wherein amonge
others many prophets and noble∣men
dwelt.
 This when the 
Romaines

had gotten,
 they were by the seditious againe driuen
out of the cittie.






THE PLACES OF THE SECOND
CITTIE.




125. THE LAKE AMYGDALON,


 neere vnto the

126. THE HOVSE OF MARIE,


the mother of 
Iohn,

and of 
Marke,
 one of the seuenty and two disciples
of Christ, wherin the faithful of the primitiue church,
were wont to assemble themselues, & to pray. Where
also after the martirdome of 
Iames
 the Apostle, 
Peter

being caste into prison by 
Herod Agrippa,
 they praied
without ceassing for his deliuerance. Who at the laste
being brought out of prison by the angell, and knock∣ing
at the dore of this house, was by a damsell brought


into the same. In the which place afterward a church
was builded which was the firste of the Christian
Greeks. And is an episcopall seate, which the 
Sirians

hould vnto this day.






127. THE HOVSE OF OLDA THE PROPHETES,



the wife of 
Sellum;

 she foretould him of the destru∣ction
of 
Ierusalem.






128. A CONDVIT,

 and by the like pipes deriued wa∣ter
into 
Herods
 pallace, and about the same, filling the
cesterns thereof.






129 THE WOOD MARKET


which 
Cestius
 set on fier.






130. THE HABITATION OF THE RECHABITES


:

who liuing religiously according to the comman∣dement
of their Father, possessed neither fieldes nor
vineyards, and like pilgrims of this world, dwelt not in
houses but in tents, and wholely abstained from wine.
Wherfore when through the necessitie of warre they
were cōpelled to come into the citty, 
Ieremy
 drinking
vnto them by the cōmandement of God, they would
drink no wine. By which example of their obedience,
the same prophet reprehended the disobedience of
the obstinat Iewes, neglecting the commandement of
God; and therefore he did set before the one a punish∣ment,
and before the other a rewarde.








131 A LAKE,


which was situate betwene two walles of
the citty,
 whereof mention is made in 
Isai
 the pro∣phet.

 and
deuided with fourteene towers▪ the which wall 
Eze∣chias

136 THE PALLACE OF HEROD,


 the which was
builded by HEROD the 
Ascalonite
 kinge of the

pollished marble stones nere vnto the west wall of the
cittie, from the old wall, euen to the middle wal: being


most singularly bewtified with siluer and gould most
strongelie fortefied with an iron gate,
 and three most
excellent towers,
 to wyt, 
Hippic, Mariam,
 and 
Phasel,

which in greatnes, strength and beautie, excelled all
the towers of the whole world. Within was the kings
haule, which being builded on high and verie loftie
with vnspeakable magnificence, was wholly cōpassed
about with moste beautifull towers,
 parlours, cham∣bers,
galleries, porches, & with pillers, with the which
there was an inclosed court open to the ayre.


In this haule, Christ was presented to 
Herod Anti∣pas
Tetrarch
 of 
Galilie,
 who killed 
Iohn
 the 
Baptist;

which 
Herod,
 asked Christ many questions, who was
there constantly accused by the Iewes. Whom, when
he answered nothing,
 the same 
Herod
 and his whole
rout despised and scorned:
 and so sent him to 
Pilat

clad in white, as if he had bene a foole, or a iester. But
nowe this pallace is a scoole for children of the In∣fidelles.






137. THE MIDDEL GATE,


 of the second wall, wher∣in
the vttermost walles being broken, the princes
of the king of 
Babilon
 did sit.






138. THE VTTERMOST COVRT,

Saint 
Peter
 was shut vp by king 
Herod Agrippa,
 who
had slane 
Iames
 the greater. Which 
Peter
 being
bound with two chaines, & most safely kept by fower
quaternions of soldiors all the daies of sweete bread:


But in the night before the day whereon hee should
haue bene put to death, he was by the Angell of the
Lord loosed from his chaines, and by him brought
foorth through an iron gate, by the first and second
watch, into the cittie.

 Here also 
Titus

The which being fower
square,
 was builded in the second wall, vpon a high
hill. It was fower score and fiue cubits high, and ha∣uing
two toppes was to be seene a far off. It was mar∣ueilouse
strong, builded by 
Herod
 the elder: who ha∣uing
in the warre lost his friendes the 
Hippics,
 called
this tower after their name 
Hippic.






141. THE TOWER MARIAMME,


 The which beeing
fiftie cubits high stood aloft in most bewtiful man∣ner,
vpon a high hill of the ould wall, the which 
Herod

builded for a memoriall of 
Mariamme
 his best belo∣ued
wife, whom he had slaine, and called it after her
name 
Mariamme.
 And because it caried the name of
a Queene, therefore it was more beautifull in shewe
then the other.






142. THE TOWER PHASELVS,


 which being fower-score
& ten cubits high, set vpon a high place of y
e

ould wall, and made alofte in forme of a ball was of


woonderful height and exceding strong.
 Which 
He∣rod

builded after the fashion of the tower 
Pharus
 in

Alexandria.
 And in the honor of his brother 
Phaselus

called it 
Phaselus,
 who being taken prisoner by the

Parthians,
 and hauing no libertie to vse neither wea∣pon
nor hands: ran his head against a stone and so kil∣led
himselfe. How this and the other two towers were
left standing after the destruction of 
Ierusalem,
 reade
vnder the nomber of (1.) going before.






143. HERODS PARKE,


which had in it an orchard & a
garden,
 watered with ponds, riuers, & fountaines:
replenished with sundry wild beastes, fishes and fouls:
hauing many large walkes, & round about the same,
many towers of tame doues.






144 THE HOSPITALL,

priest founded, with the mony which he got out of
the sepulcher of 
Dauid.
 wherin pilgrims, poore men,
and such as were Impotent were sustained and kept.






145. THE WRESTLING PLACE,

146. 
T
HE NEWE CITTIE,

Greeke 
Caenopolis,
 the fourth parte
of the cittie;
 the which was seuered
as the other parts of the cittie were
with walles, and many narrowe
waies, which went cros, extending
to the walles of the cittie. Where∣in
dwelt woolle sellers, Carpenters, Smithes, and other
workemen and artificers.






THE PLACES OF THE NEW
CITTIE.




147 BEZETHA,


a mountaine,
 the which hauing many
houses built theron was inhabited by the common
sorte of people.






148 THE CASTEL OF THE ASSIRIANS,


 nere vn∣to
the which 
Titus
 pitched his tentes, at such time
as he had gotten the wall of the citty. This castle stood
more then an arrow shoote from the second wall.








149. THE THIRD WALL,


the which also is called
the outset wall, which kinge 
Agrippa
 made vp∣on
the common charge of the cittizens,
 extending
it more broad and highe then it was before. This wall
was very firme and strong, fiue and twenty cubits
high. It had foure score and tenne square and loftie
towers which were of greate force, distant one from
the other two hundred cubits; whose building and
bewty in stone worke, was nothing inferior to that of
the temple.






150 THE BROADE STREETE:

being the firme foundation of mounte 
Sion.
 This


was a figure of Christ,
 who is the stronge and stable

so called be∣cause
it was situate in the north-easte corner of the
cittie,
 next vnto the brooke 
Cedron.
 The which also
was called the gate of 
Beniamin,
 bicause the way led
through the same vnto the tribe of 
Beniamin.
 By this
gate,
 wood was brought into the cittie out of the de∣sert.

In this gate also 
Ieremy
 the prophet was appre∣hended,

whose ruines are nowe to bee seene a greate
way out of the cittie.






155 THE GOVLDEN GATE,


situate betwene the
gate of the valley and the gate of the fountaine, so
called bicause it was gilden with goulde:
 It was also
called the Easte gate,
 bicause it was builded on the
easte side of the Temple.
 And bicause it led by a ve∣ry
shorte way, from the temple of mounte 
Oliuet,
 it
was rather a gate of the temple then of the cittie:
 and
therefore 
Neemias
 maketh no mention thereof. By
this gate Christe came riding vppon an asse into the
cittie of 
Ierusalem
 at what time men cutte downe
palmes and strowed them in his way, crying 
Hosanna

before him.






156 THE GATE OF EPHRAIM,


 which now of som is
called Saint 
Stephens
 gate,

Israell,
 beate downe the wall of 
Ierusalem

by the space of foure hundred cubits,
 and in trium∣phant
manner hee being caried into the cittie in his
chariot through that breach, became Lorde of the
cittye. The which wall together with the towers
thereof, 
Ozia
 kinge of 
Iuda
 afterwarde restored a∣gaine.






157. THE WATER GATE,


 the which was situate be∣twene
mount 
Sion,
 and the mount 
Moria,
 in the
valley called 
Mello,
 toward the east. It was called the
water gate, bicause it opened a passage, vnto the foun¦taine
of the water of 
Siloe:
 and bicause horses were ca∣ried
through the same to be watred in the brooke 
Ce∣dron.

And for this cause it was called the easte horse
gate and it tended toward the valley 
Gehennom.






158 THE GATE GENATH,


or the gate of kinge

Herods
 Garden,
 which was not farre from the se∣cond
wall of the cittye. By which, water was brought
vppe into the Tower

Ro∣maines.






159 THE GATE OF THE KINGES GARDEN,



which in mounte 
Sion

161 THE FISH GATE,


 the which was situate nexte to
the tower of

 and the lower cittie, towardes the weste:
and by the vault adioyning to the same,
 it gaue a con∣uenient
passage too and from the cittie to euery man.
And it was called the fish gate, because through the
same, fishes were brought into the cittye from 
Ioppe,

and from other townes of the sea cost. This also had
other names, as the gate of 
Dauid:
 and the marchants
gate. 
Dauids
 gate, bicause it was nexte to 
Dauids
 to∣wer:
& the merchants gate, bicause by the same much
marchandize were carried into the cittie from 
Bethe∣lem,
Hebron, Gaza,
 from 
AEgipt,
 and from 
AEthio∣pia.

By this gate strangers that came from the weste,
were wont to enter into the cittie.






162. THE DOVNG GATE,


 on the east side of the cit∣tie,
toward the corner gate, on the north-east, cari∣ed
all the doung and filth of the cittie which the raine
gathered together, into the brooke 
Cedron.
 Where
vpon it was rightly called the doung gate.






163. THE GATES OF WOMENS TOWERS


.
 On the
north end of the citty,
 by which the seditious brake
forth vppon the 
Romaines,
 when they beseeged the
cittie.








164. THE VALLEY GATE,


 so named,
 bicause it made
way into the valley of 
Iosephat,
 situate in the midst
betwene the doung gate,
 and the goulden gate, and
not far distant from the sheepe market,
 and the poole
called 
Probatica.
 The which also for this cause deser∣ued
to be called the droue gate,
 bicause the flockes of
cattell which were soulde in the sheepe market and
were to bee offered for sacrifice in the temple, were
brought in by this gate. But now it is called Saint 
Ste∣phens

gate of the first martyr 
Stephen,
 which was sto∣ned
to death not far from the same.






165. THE OLDE GATE,


which being on the west part
of the cittie,
 was called in time past by the 
Iebusites

the gate 
Iebus.
 It was also called the iudgement gate,
bicause in olde time,
 the Iudges did sit there in Iudge∣ment.

For then the Seniors did exercise iustice and
Iudgement in the gates of their citties.
 And such as
were condemned to die, went out at this gate.
 Where
vpon Christ was led out of the same to bee crucified.

Of this gate, there are at this day some oulde remain∣ders
and ruines to be seene.






166 THE ROCKE


: which was very high, going alonge
from the tower 
Psephina
 vnto mounte 
Sion,
 vpon
the which the whole west wall of the cittie stood.






167 THE TOWER ANANEEL,


 the which being not
far distant from the corner gate,

the which was builded by king 
Dauid
 in a corner
of two deepe valleys,
 on the toppe of a broken rocke,
with foure square stones moste firmely ioyned toge∣ther
with Iron and leade: whose singular fortitude,
and notable bewty, for the commendation of Christs
spouse (which is the Church) is spoken of by 
Salomon

when he saith. 
Thy neck is like the tower of Dauid, buil∣ded
with bulwarkes, where vppon there hang a thousand
shields;
 
yea all the weapons of the Giants.






170 THE HIGH TOWER,


 which was builded vppon
the gate of the valley.
 The which also kinge 
Ozias

repaired, and that it might be seene beyonde mounte

Oliuet,
 hee made it one hundred and fiftye cubites
high.






171 THE LANTERN TOWER,


situate on the North
end of the cittie, which men thinke was so called,
bicause fier was continually kepte there,
 to serue as a
marke both for land and seafaring men, to direct them
the right way.








172. THE GREAT TOWER,


 which standing neere the
wall of the temple was higher then the rest.






173. THE TOWER MEAH,


 otherwise 
Emat,
 that is
to say of one hundred cubits, which was not farre
from the temple.






174. THE TOWER PSEPHINA,


 which was eighte
square, of seuenty cubits highe, founded at the
North-weste corner of the cittie,
 vppon a very high
rocke: being like a stronge tower, which by reason of
the exceding hight thereof was feareful, from whence
on a cleere day, men might behould 
Arabia,
 the sea,
and the vttermoste borders of the 
Hebrues.
 The ruines
whereof are as yet to be seene.






175 THE TOWER OF SILOE,


 which falling in
Christs time slue eighteen men.






176 THE DEEP VALLEY,


 which compassing mount

Sion
 on the North and south parte, went all along
the weste side of the cittie, euen to the gate of 
Ephra∣im,

making a fitte and conuenient ditch for the Cit∣tie.










THE PLACES WITHOVT

178. BETHANIA,


the noble castle of 
Marry
 and of 
Mar∣tha

the sisters of 
Lazarus,
 hauing many houses, the
which was situat beyond mount 
Oliuet,
 distant from

Ierusalem
 fifteene furlongs,
 that is, two Italian miles.
From which place, though it were but a little way off,
yet by reason that mount 
Oliuet
 lay betwene, the cit∣tie

Ierusalem
 could not be seene: excepte from a little
hill from whence part of mount 
Sion
 might be seene.
Christe often times lodged in this house of 
Martha:

where he preached the worde of God to 
Mary
 sitting
at his feete. Here he raifed vp 
Lazarus
 to life, after he
had beene buried foure daies, and began to stincke.
Here, hee sitting in the house of

 priests
situate at the east foote at the mounte

 to fetch the Asse
and the Coulte. The which brought, and the disci∣ples
cloathes laide on the Coulte, hee roade on the
same into 
Ierusalem.
 But comming down from mount

Oliuet,
 and seeing the cittie, he wept on her, and pro∣phesied
hir vtter ruine bicause she knew not the day of
hir visitation.






180 THE CASTLE OPPOSITE,


 or which lyeth o∣uer
against you (to vse the wordes of Christ) when
he sent his disciples to fetch him the Asse.
 It was a vil∣lage
right ouer against 
Bethphage.






181 THE WELL,


 nere vnto 
Bethanie,
 where when the
Lorde came to raise vp 
Lazarus, Martha
 first met
with him, and afterward called forth hir sister 
Mary.






182 THE LITTLE HILL,


at the foote of mounte 
Oli∣uet,

neere vnto the Doue-house a little aboue the
valley of 
Siloe.






183. THE WITHERED FIG-TREE,


planted beside the
way of 
Bethanie,
 the which bearing no fruite, but
garnished only with leaues, was curssed of Christ and
so presently withered.








184 THE DRAGON FOVNTAINE,


which doth
springe euen at this daye,
 which was betwene the
valley and the dung gate.






185. GEHENNOM,


the which also was called 
Benhen∣nom,

that is to say, the valley of the sons of 
Ennom.

It was a place which was situate in the Suburbes of
the cittie of 
Ierusalem
 towarde the South-easte.
 In
which place of 
Benhinnom
 was the tabernacle and the
Idole 
Moloch:
 the which Idole as it was chiefe and
principall amonge all the other Idols, so the same
being the greatest abhomination and moste hated
vnto God, hee often times forbad the same in the
scriptures. It was an Idoll the matter whereof was
brasse; made in the likenesse and similitude of a king,
it was hollow within, and had a head like to the head
of a Calfe, the other partes or members of the bo∣dy
hauing the shape and fashion of a man, the armes
whereof were stretched out: whereto the children that
shoulde bee offered were made faste, with the vehe∣ment
and extreame heate of the Idoll were burned
and vtterly consumed being so houlden as it were of
the same betweene his armes. For when the Idoll
was made red whot with the fier which they had
put into the hollownesse of the same, then the moste
wicked parents of these children in moste cruell and
barbarous manner, deliuered vppe their sonnes and
their daughters to these detestable and diuelish Im∣bracings


of the Idoll, that so they mighte bee burnte.
And this they did of a certaine deuelish deuotion,
offeringe them vppe to the Diuell 
Moloch
 for a burnt
offering of moste filthie sauour. Amiddest these
horrible tormentes where with they were thus tor∣mented,
the miserable Clamor of the children could
in no wise bee heard, whereby the parentes mighte
in any sorte bee moued to pittie or compassion, for
that the priestes of this Idole 
Moloch,
 during the
whole time of the sacrifice,
 did vsually make an ex∣ceeding
greate noise both with the trumpettes and
drums.


Wherevppon that place was called also 
Tophet.
 In
this abhominable manner,
 
Achaz,
 and 
Manasses

also,
 kinges of Iuda, beeing euen as madde as the
Common people, offered vppe their sonnes to the
Diuell 
Moloch.
 The which detestable madnesse, the
godly kinge 
Iosias
 seeking at the length to redresse,
brake in peeces the image of 
Moloch,
 cut downe his
Groues, and defiled the place thereof with the fil∣thinesse
of dead Carcasses, of bones, and of other vn∣cleane
thinges, and appointed it to bee a perpetuall
dunghil for euer.


In this Valleye 
Ieremye
 at the commandement
of GOD,
 breaking an earthen potte in peeces against
the grounde,
 before the Elders of 
Iuda:
 prophesied
that GOD woulde after the selfesame manner, break
and destroye both the Cittye and the people. Ac∣cording
to which prophesie, there was so great and
mightie a multitude of people slaine there, because
they had filled this place with the bloud of Innocent
children, that this place was called no more the val∣ley
of 
Tophet,
 but 
Poliandron,
 that is to saye a heape
of manye dead bodies, whose Carcases lyeng


there vnburied, became meat for the birdes of the
ayre and for the beastes of the field.






186. GETHSEMANI,


a ferme place, at the foote of
mount 
Oliuet.
 This had manie fruitfull oliue trees.
When Christ intended to go vnto the garden that
was in mount 
Oliuet,
 he came from his last supper in∣to
this place, heauie and sorrowfull vnto the death.






187 THE GARDEN OF OLIVET,


in the mount of

Oliuet,
 where Christ praied vnto his father three
times,
 that the cuppe of his passion might passe from
him.
 And being in an agony, as he continued in prai∣er,

he swet bloud which fel droppe by dropp vnto the
earth:
 at what time hee was comforted by an angell
from heaueu.
 In 
Hieroms
 time there was a Church
builded on this place,
 which is as yet to be seene.






188 THE KINGS GARDEN,


the which also was cal∣led
the inclosed garden.
 It was in the Suburbes of

Ierusalem,
 walled round about. And like to a parra∣dise
it was planted with trees,
 of all sorts of fruits,
 with
hearbes,
 with flowers of most sweet sauour, and what
soeuer els that might delight the sences.
 It had also
most pleasant and conuenient walkes. In this was that
famous fountaine 
Rogel,
 & the stone 
Zoeleth,
 of both
which there is often mencion made in the Scripture;
where 
Adonias
 when he purposed to raigne, offered
oblations, and with his followers made a feast.








189. THE GROAVE OF MOLOCH,


 consecrated to
the Idol 
Moloch:
 where the worshippers thereof,
after they had ended their sacrifice, committed forni∣cation
vnder the shadow of the trees.






190 THE MOVNT OF OFFENCE


;
 it was a very high
mountaine,
 situate on the south side of the kinges
garden. Where the moste wise 
Salomon
 being nowe
old, was seduced & made folish by his strange wiues,
building a temple to 
Melchom
 the Idoll of the 
Ammo∣nites,

which also he worshipped.






191 THE MOVNT OLIVET


; or mounte of Oliues, so
called by reason of the great plenty of oliues which
grew there: called also in Greeke 
Elaeon,
 which other∣wise
also is named the famous, and holy mountaine.
It was situate on the east side of 
Ierusalem.
 It was se∣perated
from the high cittie, the valley of 
Cedron
 ly∣ing
betwen, distant from the cittie a Saboth daies ior∣ney,
according to the Scripture: but according to 
Io∣sephus,

it was distant fiue furlonges: who also addeth
that the top of the hill was six furlongs from the citty.

For it was of so greate hight,
 that from the same, not
only almost all the streetes of 
Ierusalem
 but also the
dead sea,
 might easily be seene. And besides the oliues
it abounded with palmes,
 pines, mirtells, and other
fruitful trees.


In the toppe of this hill, the holy king 
Dauid
 fleeing
from the face of his sonne 
Absolom,
 weping, and bare∣footed
worshipped God.
 In this mountaine also his


sonne 
Salomon
 forgetting all godlinesse,
 erected a
temple to 
Astaroth
 the Idole of the 
Sidonians,
 right
ouer against the temple of 
Ierusalem
 (from whence e∣uery
one that committed Idolatry mighte beeseene.)
The which also with all other places dedicated to I∣dols,

Iosias
 vtterly destroied.


Christ often times came vp into this mountaine,
both for quietnesse sake and also to pray,
 tarieng there
all the night.
 Also from the top of this mount, he as∣cended
into heauen,
 in the presence of his disciples
standing there and behoulding him, after he had bles∣sed
them.






192. THE MOVNT OF OFFENCE,


a high mountain,
on the other side of the brooke 
Cedron,
 and on the
North side of the mounte 
Oliuet,
 distant from 
Ieru∣salem

foure furlonges.
 Whereon 
Salomon
 by the mo∣tion
of his heathenish wiues,
 builded a Temple to

Chamosh
 the Idole of the 
Moabites.
 This also 
Iosias

brake downe. In the time of the 
Machabees
 a Castle
was builded on this mount, some tokens whereof are
to be seene at this day.






193 THE FVLLERS MONVMENTE


: the which
was not farre from the Corner gate,
 in the North-easte.






194. THE PALME TREESE,


 wherof mention is made
in 
Neemias,
 and in Saint 
Iohns
 Gospell.








195 THE DOVE-HOVSE,


on the South ende of the
mount 
Oliuet;
 It was made of stone, round, loftie,
and fashioned like a tower, wherin were store of doues
to the number of foure or fiue thousand.






196. THE BRIDGE OF CEDRON,


 made of stone,
with one arche erected ouer the brooke 
Cedron,

which 
Helena
 the Emperes caused to be made in that
place.






197. THE SEPVLCHER OF THE VIRGIN MARY,



which was in the valley of 
Iosaphat
 neere vnto the
ferme place of 
Gethseman,
 at the foot of mount 
Oliuet

wherein the body of the most holy and blessed virgin,
was decently buried by the Apostles.






198. THE COMMON PLACE OF BVRIALL,


 which
was in the velley of 
Iosaphat,
 where the common
sort of people were buried.






199. THE FOVNTAINE OF SILOE,


 whereto was
ioyned the poole of 
Siloe,
 the which also is called
the lower poole, lyeng on the weste side of the valley
of 
Iosophat,
 and springing from the roote of mounte

Sion.
 The water thereof being cleere, sweete, and
plentifull, ran with a still and calme streame into the
brooke 
Cedron.


This fountaine kinge 
Hezechias
 repaired. In the


poole of this fountain the man which was borne blind
washing his eies which Christe had annointed with
clay and his spittle,
 receiued his sight.
 
Iosephus
 teste∣fieth
that 
Siloe,
 and all other waters which were with∣out
the cittie, did so faile and vanish away before the
comming of 
Titus Caesar,
 that water was soulde hard
by them.
 And after his comming, they did so abound
to him and his hoast, that they had water enough for
them and for their cattell. Concerning the vertue of
this water, the most dilligent Surueyour of this place

Saligniacus,
 writeth in this sort. 
The water of this foun∣taine
is of greate price at this day, euen among the Sara∣cens
themselues. For whereas naturally they be rammage
and stinke like Goates,
 
they washing themselues and their
children therein, doe mittigate the euill sauour thereof.
The Turkes also make great accoumpte thereof, for that
they finde by experience, that the vse thereof is good for
the sight of their eies.






200 STEPHEN,


 the Deacon, in the very flower of his
youth, was stoned to death, praying to God for
them that stoned him, whose garments the young
man Paule kept. This man, was the firste that trium∣phed
with the palme of martirdome.






201 THE BROOKE CEDRON


; is a riuer on the easte
side of 
Ierusalem
 betweene the same and mounte 
O∣liuet,

which being increased with diuers springs issu∣ing
from all partes out of the mountaine,
 and pooles,

ran through the valley of 
Iosaphat,
 and 
Gehennom
 with
a siluer streame, and so passed through the plaines of
the wildernesse into the dead sea.


On the bankes of both side this riuer, there grewe


many frutefull trees: the pleasant shew whereof, toge∣ther
with the gardens neere adioyning which were
watered with the cristall streames of 
Cedron,
 greatly
delighted the eies and mindes,
 of such as walked by
the same. King 
Dauid
 passed ouer this riuer bare foo∣ted,

bare headed, and with watery eies, accompanied
with his moste trusty frendes, fleeing from the face of
his sonne 
Absolom.
 Christ also went ouer the same,
with his disciples when hee wente to the garden of
mount 
Oliuet.






202 THE VALLEY OF IOSOPHAT,


 the which also
is called the valley of 
Cedron,
 and the valley of

Mountaines.
 It is a wide and deepe valley betwene 
Ie∣rusalem

and mounte 
Oliuet,
 compassing the cittie on
the east parte,
 the which is made very fruitfull by the
passage of the brooke 
Cedron.
 The greate deepenes
of this valley was much filled by 
Titus
 and 
Adrian

the Romaine Emperours,
 casting into the same great
store of earth with the ruines of the temple and cittie,

yet it was not therewith any thing neere leueled.
 In
this valley, the godly and religious kinges of 
Iuda, Asa
Ezechias
 and 
Iosias,
 burned the Idols of the temple,
and cast their ashes into the brooke 
Cedron.


This valley was the common place of buriall for
the whole cittie,
 where all the common sorte of peo∣ple
were buried.
 For it was the manner of the Iewes
to bury their dead courses out of the citty. And in the
same place, the Turkes are now buried.






203. THE VALLEY OF SILOE,


 so named of the
fountane of 
Siloe:
 wherein the Iewes which at this
day dwell at 
Ierusalem,
 are buried.








204 THE WAIE OF THE FVLLERS FIELDE,


 ly∣ing
betweene the water of 
Siloe
 and the South-easte
corner of the cittie.
 Here the Prophet 
Isaias

foretoulde king 
Achaz,
 that Christ should be borne
of a virgin.






205 THE WAY OF THE CAPTIVITIE


.
 These
small prickes traced foorth in length (as you see)
doe demonstrate the way, by which Christe was
ledde captiue for the redemption of mankinde. For
being come into the garden of mounte 
Oliuet
 to pray
after his laste supper in the parlour of mounte 
Sion,

and hauing offered to GOD his Father the holye
sacrifice of praiers,
 returning from thence hee mette
with his enimies which came to take him,
 to whome
hee yeelded himselfe. Who hadde scarce gone for∣tie
steppes from the place where hee prayed, but
the soldiors which were sente from the highe priestes
and rulers of the people, layed handes on him, tooke
him, and bound him.


From whence he was presently caried as a meke
Lambe by those rauening woolues, armed with
weapons,
 ouer the brooke 
Cedron,
 to the house of

ANNA,
 which was distante from the place where
hee was taken, two thousande three hundred and
sixtie pases. And from hence hee was caried to the
Pallace of 
CAIPHAS
 three hundred and thirtie pa∣ces.
And so afterwarde hee was conducted by the
souldiors and by the people to the pallace of 
Pilate,

which was distante from that of 
CAIPHAS
 a thou∣sande


pases. And from thence to the pallace of 
HE∣ROD

which was distante three hundred and fiftie pa∣ces.
Lastly from thence againe to the pallace of 
Pi∣late

hee was caried by another way then that which
hee came, the distance of sixe hundred elles which
make about the length of halfe a myle and more. The
pases whereof wee speake here, containe two foot and
a halfe.






206 THE WAY, TO ANATHOT,


to 
Bethel,
 and to
the wildernesse.






207 THE WAY TO IERICO, and to ENGADDI,


 
of the which there is mention made in some of the
Euangelists.






208. HERE THE THREE APOSTLES,


 
Peter, Iames,

and 
Iohn,
 sate while Christe prayed in the Gar∣den,
being aboute a stones caste from the selfe same
place.






209 HERE


the other eight Apostles taried being distante
about a quarter of a mile from the other three pla∣ces.






210. HERE CHRISTE,


 to make vs free, was betraied with
a kisse by the Traitor 
Iudas,
 and was bounde with
hard and straight bands (as if he had ben an euil doer)
by the Iewes, whom he beate downe backward to the


ground by the word of his mouth.
 There 
Simon Peter

moued sodainely with great feruencie,
 stroke the ser∣uant
of the high Priest whose name was 
Malchus,
 and
cut off his right eare: which christ immediately resto∣red
againe. But the rest of the Apostles being afeard
left the Lord and fled.






211. IN this place of mount 
Oliuet


 right ouer against the
temple neere to a certaine water,
 Christ sate with his
disciples,
 making a longe sermon concerning the de∣struction
of 
Ierusalem,
 the afflictions of the godly to
come, the comming of false prophetes, the signes
of the ende of the world, and concerning the manner
of the last iudgement. In the which place, there was
afterward builded a temple which is now desolate.






212. THIS WAY Christ came to 
Ierusalem,


 sitting vp∣on
the Asses coult,
 wayted on with a great compa∣ny
of men,
 som going before,
 and othersome follow∣ing
after him: where vnto also a great number which
came out of the cittie ioyned themselues. So that
he seemed to be receiued of all men with so greate fa∣uour,
that many spraed their cloathes in the waye,
som cutting downe the bowes of palmes, oliues, and
other trees, to honour him there withal, strowed them
in the way. And the voices of such as reioyced was
heard in euery place as he went resounding with these
cries, 
Osanna in the highest, blessed is he that commeth
in the name of the Lord.
 With this pompe and triumph
the true king and humble triumpher, entered in at the
goulden gate, and rode aboute the temple, and the
greatest part of the cittie. With this newe spectacle,
the whole cittie was moued saying, 
Who is this?
 The


multitude which followed him answered, 
This is Ie∣sus
the Prophet of Nazareth a Citty af Galile.
 Then the
crie of those that reioysed and were gladde increased
more and more, and men and women, young and
olde, yea which is wonderful) the very infants, which
came from al parts, cryed out together, 
Osanna to the
sonne of Dauid, Blessed bee the king of Israel, which
commeth a king in the name of the Lord. Blessed be the
kingdome that commeth in the name of him, that is Lord
of our father Dauid: peace in Heauen, and glory in the
highest, Osanna in the hyghest.
 With these ioyful voi∣ces
and cryes, they proclaiming their 
Messias,
 follo∣wed
him euen into the Temple. Where this newe
king happily beginning his kingdome, presently hea∣led
the blinde and the lame. In the meane time the
wicked and enuious Pharisies, the chiefe priestes and
Scribes, doo fret and fume, who seeing the great mar∣uels
which he did, and the children crying in the tem∣ple,

Osanna
 to the sonne of 
Dauid,
 said among them∣selues,

Do ye not see how we profit nothing? Behold the
whole world goeth foorth after him.
 Wherevpon they
begin with Iesus himselfe saying, 
Mayster, doost thou
heare what these say? Rebuke thy Disciples.
 To whome
he shewing that this was long before prophesied of
by the Prophet, answereth, 
Why should they not? Haue
ye not read, Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings
thou hast ordained praise? I say vnto you if these
holde their peace, the stones shall
presentlie crye.










THE PLACES ON THE
SOVTH PART OF THE CITTIE.




213. 
A
BACVC.


 Here the Angell of the
Lord taketh vp the prophet 
Aba∣cuc

by the haire of the head,
 as hee
was carying to the reapers in the
fielde their dinner, and caried him
with the same meat into 
Babilon
 to
feede Daniel,
 being shut vp in the
Lyons denne. Who being fed, he brought 
Abacuc

hither againe.






214 ACELDEMA, or 
Haceldemach,


 that is to saye the

fielde of bloud.
 It was a potters fielde situate at the
South parte of mounte 
Sion
 hauing behinde it a hill
of the same name.
 This fielde,
 by the counsaile of the
Iewes,
 was bought with the thirtie peeces of siluer for
the which 
Iudas
 soulde Christ,
 that it might serue to
bury strangers in,
 the middle parte whereof the Em∣peresse

Helen
 caused to be inclosed with a foure square
wall in length seuenty and two foote, and in bredth
fiftie.
 And the same to bee couered ouer with a roofe
hauing seuen loope holes by which the deade bodies
of Christians might be let downe.


The vertue of this earth is reported to be wonder∣full,
and almost incredible, to witte, that it bringeth
and consumeth into dust, the bodies of the dead men
within the space of twenty foure howers, leauing no∣thing
but the bones.








215 THE FVLLERS FIELDE,


 which lay all along at
the South ende of the cittie,
 euen from the valley
of 
Siloe
 east ward vnto mount 
Gihon,
 towards the west

this fielde the Fullers did scoure their cloathes in the
brooke next adioyning, and did set them on tainters,
and so dry them.






216. THE DENNE, OR CAVE, of 
Iames
 the lesse,



wherin he is said to haue hid himselfe by the space

the Lorde appered to him a parte,
 after his resurrec∣tion.






217 THE CAVE OF PETER THE APOSTLE,



wherein after hee had denied the Lorde thrise, hee
repented him and mourned with many teares.






218 THE TENTS OF THE ASSYRIANS,


of whom
for a reuenge of their blasphemy, the most stronge
to the nomber of 185000 in the very first night of the
beseeging 
Ierusalem,
 were slaine by the Angell of the
Lord,
 and (as 
Augustine
 reporteth) their bodyes
were brought into dust,
 that they might not infect the
aier: their garments, armour and weapons notwith∣standing
remaining whole and sound, that the people
of 
Ierusalem
 might haue the spoile.








219 THE HOVSE OF ELIAS,


 wherein it is said that
the prophet 
Elias
 sometime dwelt. Where after∣ward
also a Church was builded.






220. THE MOVNTAINE EROGE,


otherwise called
the 
South Mountaine,
 being very high and loftie,

bowing a little towarde the west.
 Concerning this
mountaine this is worthy to bee noted;
 That, when

Ozias
 king of Iuda presumed to put on him the priests
attire,
 entered into the sanctuary of the Temple,
 and
offered vpon the golden altar, the incense of sweete
sauour vnto God: by and by there came a great earth¦quake,

(whereof also 
Amos
 and 
zacharias
 the Pro∣phets
make mention) whereby the vpper part of the
Temple was shaken, and this mountaine cleft in the
mids, with so great and terrible violence, that one
part thereof falling and tumbling downe was rolled
and carried by the space of foure furlongs euen right
ouer against the East mountaine (which is called the
mount of offence) where at the length it staied. King

Ozias
 himselfe in the meane time, blasted and terrifi∣ed
with lightning, was stricken in the forehead with a
Leprosie. For the which cause he being presently cast
out of the Temple and Citty, languished all his life
long, and was shut vp in his house and separated euen
till the day of his death.






221. A FOVNTAINE


.
 At this Fountaine, the Starre,
which vanished away when the three wise men,

which came from the East, were entered Ierusalem,



appeared vnto them againe: and led them vnto 
Beth∣lehem.






222. THE CAVE OF the Prophet 
Ieremy:


 wherein he
sitting with a greeued and sorrowfull mind, wept,
moorned,
 and bewailed the destruction of 
Ierusalem,
 with sobs and sighes. Where 
Helena,
 the Empresse
(as 
Nicephorus
 testifieth) builded a notable monu∣ment.






223 ISAIAS


.
 Here that notable Prophet Isai, when hee
prophesied in Ierusalem about threescore and ten
yeares,
 by the commandment of king 
Manasses,
 was
split through the body with a sawe, and was buried
vnder an Oake, whose sepulture is to be seene at this
day.






224 THE CAVES OF THE APOSTLES


. There are
many Caues, wherein eight of the Apostles (as it
is reported) hid themselues, during the time of the
Lords passion.






225 THE MONVMENT ABSOLOM,


 is a marble
piller,
 with an Inscriptiō on the same, distant from
Ierusalem two furlonges: which 
Absolom
 beeing a∣liue
set vppe to himselfe for a monument in the kings
valley: where there is as yet to be seene a great heape
of stones, which daily is increased more and more.
For the Pagans and strangers passing by that way, vse
this for a custome, that euery man cast a stone at the


piller, and challenging as it were, according to the
lawe,
 his rebellion againste his father Dauid, they
cursse him with this malediction, 
Cursed be the Parri∣cide
Absalom, and accursed be all they for euer, which
vniustly do persecute their parents.






226 THE RIVER OF THE VPPER FOVNTAINE,



situate on the South parte of mount Sion (which

Hieron
 calleth the 
Fullers fountaine
) the which the
noble king 
Ezechias
 repaired with the conduct therof
also.
 This he choaked with earrh,
 at what time the 
As∣syrians

beseeged 
Ierusalem.






227 THE SEPVLCHER OF ZACHARIAS,


the son
of 
Barachias,
 whome the Iewes slue betweene the
temple and the altar.








THE PLACES ON THE WEST SIDE
OF THE CITTIE.




228. BAALPARASIM,


is a field in the valley of 
Raphaim,

wherein Dauid the king,
 at the first time, ouerthrew
the 
Philistians,
 and buried their Gods which he found
in their tents.






229. HERODS TENTS,


 which as 
Iosephus
 witnesseth,
he pitched on the weste part of the cittie.








230. THE FOVNTAINE GIHON THE LOWER,



which sprange vp in the end of the fullers field,
 the
waters wherof 
Ezechias
 brought vnto the vpper oun¦taine.






231. THE FOVNTAINE GIHON the higher,


 spring∣ing
from the mount 
Gihon,
 which afterwards 
Eze∣chias

stopped vp,
 and cutting deeper into the rocke, he
brought the waters thereof vnto the west parte of the
cittie of Dauid,
 by conduct pipes vnder the earth, by
which he brought it through the middest of the cittie,
into the innermoste fountaine, leaste when the cittye
should be beseeged the people might want water.






232. IVDAS,


 who of an Apostle being become a traytor,
hoong himselfe vpon a wilde figge tree:
 And being
hanged brust asunder in the midst, and all his bowels
gushed out.






233. THE MOVNT OF CALVARIE,


 a rockie moun∣taine
of meane hight,
 called in the Hebrue tongue

Golgatha;
 which was nexte to the Northwest parte of
the cittie.
 In the which place offenders condemned
in open iudgement,
 were put to death. Where at all
times,
 a man might see the boanes and bowels of men
hanged, or otherwise put to death. Here, 
Christe Iesus

our sauiour, which knew no sin, becam (as the Apostle
sayth) sinne for vs, that is to say, was made a sacrifice


for our sinnes, and as if he had beene an euill dooer
was hanged between two theeues, and for our saluatiō
crucified. So that now mounte 
Caluary,
 which afore∣time
was a place moste infamous, by the passion and
bloud of Christ, is now made famous and honorable.






234. MOVNT GIHON,


 a mountain full of stones, high
and long, which running along by the West part
of the Cytty, growing lesse and lesse towards the gate
of iudgement, is seuered from the Citty by a deepe
valley. In this mountaine, at the commaundement
of 
Dauid,
 
Salomon
 was annointed king, by 
Sadoc
 the
chiefe priest, and by 
Nathan
 the prophet with the ho∣lie
oyle. To whom immediatly all the people cryed,

God saue king Salomon.






235 THE MONVMENT of 
Anani


the chiefe priest, of
which 
Iosephus
 maketh mention, in his sixt booke,
and thirteenth chapter of the Iewes warre.






236 THE PEARE TREES


of the valley 
Raphaim,
 the
which 
Iosephus
 calleth the wood of weeping,
 neere
vnto the which Dauid assisted by God from Heauen,
gaue a second ouerthrow to the Philistines, pursuing
them a great way.






237 THE SEPVLCHER OF CHRIST,


 was a newe
Monument,
 eight foot long, distant from Mount

Caluarie,
 one hundred and eight foot, and from moūt

Sion
 about a mile: which 
Ioseph
 of 
Arimathea,
 a


noble Senator,
 had hewen out in the rocke for him∣selfe,

in the Garden neere vnto mount 
Caluarie.
 In
the which Sepulcher he togither with 
Nichodemus,

and the virgine Mary,
 with other godly women, buri∣ed
the body of Iesus,
 being with the consent of 
Pilate

taken from the crosse,
 and then trimmed with mirre
and Aloes,
 and wrapt in a fine linnen cloath, was put
honorablely into the same, the head layed toward the
west: And rolling a stone of exceeding waight to
the mouth of the monument,
 he went his way. But
in the meane time, the chiefe priestes and 
Pharisies,

going about to hinder the resurrection of Christ ta∣kinge
vnto them a strong garde of soldiors, watched
the sepulcher, and sealed the stone which shut vp the
mouth of the sepulcher, least the keepers and watch∣men
being corrupted with money shoulde deale de∣ceiptfully.
But this dilligence of the Iewes, by which
they went about to houlde Christ in the graue from
rising againe, increased the miracle, and confirmed
the faith of the Resurrection.
 And there hee firste
of all appered to 
Mary
 Magdalen,
 at the monument
as shee was weeping, in the likenesse of a Garde∣ner.






238. A WOOD,


neere vnto the cittie, as is to be gathe∣red
by 
Iosephus
 in his sixt booke and fourtene chap¦ter
of the Iewes warre.






239 THE BROOKE, OR RIVER GIHON,


 at the south-west
corner of the cittie: which king 
Achas
 had
begun to bringe from the lower fountaine 
Gihon
 into
the vpper fountaine: the which kinge 
Ezechias
 at the
last finished.








240 THE VALLE OF DEAD CARCASSES,


 which
lay betweene mount 
Caluarie,
 and the walles of 
Ie∣rusalem:

so called, bicause the dead carcasses, bones, &
ashes, of such as were put to death or burnt on mount

Caluarie
 were cast thereinto.






241 THE VALLEY OF THE FOVNTAINE GI∣HON:



whereof mencion is made in the booke of
the Cronicles,
 and in 
Iosephus.






242. THE VALLEY 
Raphaim,


 that is to say, of Gyants. It
a is valley on the west side of the cittie very large &
great,,
 which beginneth at the north part, and exten∣deth
vnto the South;
 bringing foorth most plentifully
in time past excellent wheate, wine, oyle, and al other
fruites. In this valley Dauid by the helpe of God, twise
ouercame the 
Phillistines
 which sought to inuade him
with a great armie.






243. THE WAIES TO BETHLEHEM, 
Emaus,
 to 
Gaza,

and to 
Ioppa,


 which 
Salomon
 made with flint and
stoane, euen as he did other waies, which led to 
Ierusa∣lem,

both to make the passage more easie, and also to
shew foorth the magnificence of his kingdome in this
point.






244. THE WAIE TO SILOE, and to 
Gabaon,


whereof

Brocardus
 in his sixt booke of his traueile maketh
mention.








245. HERE CHRIST


fell againe;
 as according to the tra∣dition
of the fathers of old.






246. HERE IESVS


 tourning himselfe about to the wo∣men
that mourned and wept,
 
sayde,
 ye daughters
of Ierusalem,
 weep not for me; but weep for your selues and
for your children, bicause the day shall come, &c.






247. HERE CHRIST FELL DOWNE


the third time
vnder his crosse:
 as the fathers of old time haue af∣firmed.






248 HERE CHRIST WAS STRIPT OVT OF HIS
GARMENTS;


 whose body being all to torne with
whips,
 could not but be very soare, wherunto his blou∣dy
garments cleauing gaue newe occasion of paine,

when they were violently pulled off.
 And standing
there naked al the while that the cros was a preparing,

in the could & wind, he sate down at the length vpon a
stone, where he dranke wine mixt with gaule & mirh.






249 HERE CHRIST BEING LAYED ON HIS BACK
ON THE CROSSE,


 and stretched out vpon the
same,
 his hands and feete was nayled thereunto with
Iron nayles:
 and his tender members were with such
force strayned and racked vppon the crosse,
 that the
very arteries and sinewes were loosened,
 and all his
bones might be toulde.








250 THIS IS the most notable and memorable place of
the whole world,


 euen the clifte of the Rocke of
mount 
Caluarie,
 wherein the Crosse bearing the bodie
of Christ,
 was fastened about high noone of the feaste
day of Passouer.
 Vpon the top of which crosse, a white
table was fastened, expressing the cause of his death,
written with 
Pilats
 owne hand in these woordes of

Hebrue, Greke
 and 
Latine.


IESVS OF NAZARETH, KING OF THE IEWES


Further it is to be remembered,
 that the Iewes did
in such manner erect and set Christ vpon his crosse,

that his backe partes might be toward 
Ierusalem,
 and
his face towards the west. For they demed him vnwoor¦thy
to haue his face toward the holie cittie.
 But wee
must thinke, that this was not done altogether by for∣tune,
or without a mystery: but rather by the singular
dispensation of God, his miseries seeme to be no false
prophets of our felicitie,
 by this meanes, and by this
dede forewarning them of that which the Prophet

Ieremy
 had prophesied should come to passe, saying

I will scatter them with an East wind before the enimie,


I will shew them the backe and not the face,
 
in the day of
their destruction.
 For as saint 
Hierom
 saith, seeing they
are dispersed throughout the whole world, and do cal
vpon God night and day in the synagogues of Sathan,

God sheweth vnto them his backe, and not his face
that they may knowe that hee is alwaies going from
them,
 and not comming towards them:
 And that e∣uen
in the day of their destruction, that is to say, du∣ring
all the time after the passion of our sauiour,
 vnto
the very ende of the worlde:
 that when the fullnesse
of the Gentiles is come in,, the remnant of the peo∣ple


of Israell may bee conuerted at the laste,
 and bee
saued. And I verily coniecture that by this their cru∣elty,
they were foretellers of our felicity. For in that
they did sette the moste sweete and amiable face of
our sauiour towarde the weste, it seemeth vnto me
to note no other thinge, but the very same which
the kingly Prophet longe before had toulde shoulde
come to passe saying, 
His eies behoulde the gentiles.

For hee hauing the eyes of his mercie opened and
fixed vppon vs,
 from the time of his passion, will not
cease to looke vpon vs with a fauorable countenance
euen vnto the end of the world.


Therefore, Christe being on this manner hanged
on the crosse, three howers naked, bloudy, wounded,
crowned with thornes, did hang between two theeues
in most grieuous torments, partaker with them of the
paine and punishment, as if he had beene a compani∣on
with them in their wickednesse: The which thing
the prophet 
Isaias
 foreshewed should come to passe,
saying, 
Hee was reputed among the wicked.
 Whome in
the meane time, the Iewes, the high priests, together
with the Scribes and elders of the people passing by,
yea the common soldiors also, and the theefe that was
crucified with him, in steed of consolation, which be∣longeth
to al that are afflicted, in most reprochful man¦ner
scorned him, shaking their heads, and saying, 
Thou
which destroiest the temple of God, and buildest the same
againe in three daies, saue thy selfe: if thou beest the sonne
of God, come downe from the crosse, He saued others, him
selfe he cannot saue If he be Christ the king of Israell, let
him come down now from the crosse; and wee will beleue
him. He trusted in God, Let him deliuer him nowe, if hee
will haue him. For he said I am the son of God.


Iesus most patiently suffering all these things more
bitter then the crosse, was so far from reuenging them


that he praied for them that mocked him saying, 
Fa∣ther


forgiue them for they know not what they doe.
 And
to the other of the theeues requiring mercy hee pro∣mised

Paradise,
 saying, 
Verely I say vnto thee, This day
thou shalt bee with me in Paradise.
 And then behoul∣ding
his well beloued mother, and the disciples also
whome he loued, and commending a virgin to a vir∣gin,

 said vnto his mother, 
Behould thy sonne.
 And then
he sayd to his disciple, 
Behould thy mother:
 who from
that hower forward tooke her for his owne. While
these thinges thus proceeded, the sunne abashed at
those passions which the creator of all the worlde suf∣fered
on the crosse, as it were mourning hid his face:
and was darkened from the sixte hower, (at what
time it shyneth in greatest glorye) vntill the ninth
hower.


Then Iesus complayning that he is forsaken of his
father, cryed out with a strong voice saying, 
My God,


My God, why haste thou forsaken me?
 This donne, to
the ende all thinges that were spoken of by the pro∣phets,

 might be fulfilled, hee sayd, 
I thirste.
 Straight
way one running,
 as though he would doo him some
good, when he had taken a spounge, and filled it with
vinegre, hee put it vppon a reede and gaue him to
drinke. Iesus wonderfully thyrsted for the saluation
of men: but the Iewes offered him nothing but gaule
and vinegre. And so soone as Iesus had tasted the

 vinegre, hee sayde, 
It is finished,
 geuing thereby to
vnderstand,
 that the sacrifice was truly ended accor∣ding
to the will of his father. And once againe cry∣ing
out with a loud voice and with sheading of teares,

 hee sayth, 
Father into thy handes I commende my spi∣rit:

And so bowing downe his heade (a man of flo∣rishing
age) hee yealded vppe his breath, the nynth
hower of the fiue and twentieth day of March, and in


the three & thirtith yere of his age and three moneths.
But in the yeare from his Incarnation, the thyrty and
foure.


By this sacrifice, the moste high and euerlasting
priest inflamed with most singular and vnspeakeable
loue, offered him selfe a sacrifice and a peace offering
to God his father, and by his death destroyed death,
ouercame Sathan, brake a sunder hell gates, restored
life, and opened vnto all beleeuers, the euerlasting
kingdome of heauen. For this cause, the fathers of
ould time, ingraued in siluer these words of the psalme
in Greeke, and set it in the circumference of the hole
which was made on the toppe of mount 
Caluary,
 and
wherein the crosse of Christ was fastened, but nowe
they are ingrauen in copper thus.


,

that is to saye,
 Here God our Kinge be∣fore
worldes wrought saluation in the middest of the
earth.


The which one and onely bloudy sacrifice moste
truly and lawfully made,
 hee woulde not by and by so
soone as he was dead be taken from the crosse, but e∣uen
as when he was aliue, so when hee was dead, by
the space of three howers he hong as a spectacle to all
men: and as he spared no one member from torment
so his will was to shed all his bloude, euen to the very
laste droppe of his moste pretious heart, and to open
the fountaine for the washing away of our sinnes,
 the
which we may vse to our endlesse comforte.
 Therfore
one of the soldiors perceauing and opening his side
and hearte,
 presently there issued foorth bloude and
water as from a moste liuely springe, to the sanctifying
and saluation of his Church. In the meane season all
thinges gaue testimonie to their Lorde and makers
death. The vaile of the Temple rente asunder in two


partes: the earth was shaken and quaked, the graues o∣pened,
the deade bodies of men arose againe, and the
stoanie rockes, (to the shame and reproach of the
Iewes for the hardnes of their hartes) claue a sunder &
burst in peeces.






251 HERE the blessed virgin 
Marie,


 accompanied with

Iohn,
 with 
Marie Magdalen,
 & with other women,
stoode with a firme mind and constant faith,
 where ac∣cording
to the prophesie of 
Simeon,
 the sworde of sor∣row
pearsed her soule.






252 HERE the soldiors


which crucified Christ, parted his
garments among them and cast lotts for his seame∣les
coate who should haue it,
 that the saying of the pro∣phet
might be fulfilled,
 
They parted my garments among
them, and for my Vesture they did cast lottes.






253. HERE the dead Corpes


of Christ, being taken down
from the Crosse,
 was deliuered to the blessed virgin

Marie
 to be buried.






254 HERE


Christ meteth with the
 women,
 which retur∣ned
from his Sepulcher toward 
Ierusalem,
 and salu∣teth
them, who imbracing and kissing his feete woor∣shiped
him.






255 HERE


Christ in the forme of a straunger,
 went with
the two disciples toward 
Emaus:
 and in the way as


they wente together, hee interpreted 
Moses,
 and the
Scriptures of all the prophets, which he proued to bee
fulfilled in him.








THE PLACES ON THE
NORTH SIDE OF THE CITTIE.




256. THE tents of the 
Chaldaeans.


On this North part of
the cittie,
 
Nabuchodonozer
 kinge of 
Babilon,
 and
the 
Chaldaeans,
 scaled the wals of 
Ierusalem,
 and wan it.






257 THE TENTS of the Romaines,


the which were pit∣ched
betweene the 
Womans
 towers,
 and the tower
PSEPHINA. On this parte, although inclosed and
fortified with a triple wall, 
Titus
 and the Romains as∣sayled

Ierusalem.
 For on this parte onely, the citty was
sauteable. And albeit the other partes were compassed
round about with one single wall onely, yet the same
being very strong, and sette vppon stony and cragged
rocks, and hauing also deepe valleies or trenches Im∣passable,
were inexpugnable. Therefore they began to
scale the first wall, which was the outermost and third
wall of the cittie. After that they tooke in hand the se∣cond
wall: And then the third wal of the cittie, which
wall also called the old wall. Next they took the castle

Antonia:
 And so the temple, which was fortified like a
castle and last of all they entered mount 
Sion,
 of al the
rest,
 the most strong. At what time also the Christians
tooke this cittie in hand to win it, they began their en∣terprise
on this part, anong whome 
Godfrey
 of 
Bullion

was the first that entered the wal, nere vnto the gate of

Ephraim,
 whose soldiors following the assalt like men,


opened immediately the sayde gate, and so wan the
cittie. The which also the 
Saracens
 beseeging on the
same parte, wan from the Christians.






258 THE HILL GAREE,


 the which was neere to 
Ie∣rusalem

one the north.






259 EREBINTH


was a little village on the north.






260. GARDENS AND FEARMES,


 inclosed with wals
and hedges: where 
Titus
 taking a vew of the citty
was in danger.






261 THE SEPVLCHER of 
Helene


Queene of the 
Adia∣bens

(who vittailed 
Ierusalem
 in the time of the fa∣mine
with wheat) the which she moste sumptuously
builded with three pinacles,
 about three furlongs di∣stant
from the cittie.
 Wherin she was buried with her
son 
Isates:
 the which also was standing in the time of

Eusebius
 and 
Hierom.






262 THE NORTH MOVNTAINE,


 where 
Pompei
 pit∣ched
his tents.






263 THE MONVMENT of 
Herod Agrippa:


 who for his
intollerable pride being striken by the angell of the
Lord,
 and consumed of wormes, dyed.








264. SAPHA,


in Greeke called 
Scopos,
 that is to say, A
place of espiall, situate towarde the north, distante
from the cittie about seuen furlongs.
 It was so named,
bycause from thence both the citty and temple might
be seene. Here 
Iaddus
 the chiefe Priest, and the rest of
the priests, in their priestly attire, and al the people clad
in white garments, went foorth to meete 
Alexander

the greate, kinge of the 
Macedonians,
 when hee came
with his army to destroy 
Ierusalem.
 Whome when

Alexander
 saw by and by suppressing his fury, in hum∣ble
sort worshipped the name of God, which shined
in goulden letters in the 
Reasonable
 of the high priest,
and gaue reuerence to the high priest. Then ente∣ring
into the Cittie and Temple, hee offered sacri∣fice
to God, and graunted greate priuiledges vnto the
Iewes.






265. THE FRVITEFVLL WOOD,


 which 
Titus
 cau∣sed
to be cut downe.






266 THE LAKE OF SERPENTS,


 which in ould time
was called 
Bethara.






267. THE WAY,


 by which men went into 
Samaria
 and

Galile.






268. THE VILLAGE


neere to 
Ierusalem,
 whereof 
Nee∣mia

maketh mention.



THese (
Christian Reader
) are the most notable and
famous places of the Citty and Temple of Ierusa∣lem.
By the placing whereof, the scituation of the rest
may easily be knowne. Therefore if wee haue made a
true description, let the praise be giuen to God, the
giuer of all good gifts. But if otherwise there bee any
defect, impute that to my want of skill, and not to my
ill will: who for that I was not able to giue towards the
furnishing of the Temple, golde, siluer, or pretious
stones, haue notwithstanding offered a little oyle to
lighten the Church; trusting that the same will be ac∣ceptable,
both to Christ,who allowed the twoe
mites which the poore Widdow offered: &
also to those that be good Christians,
whom it becommeth well to
be like vnto their hed
CHRIST.
