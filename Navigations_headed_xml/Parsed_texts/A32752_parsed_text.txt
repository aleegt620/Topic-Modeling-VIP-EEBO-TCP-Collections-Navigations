A
RELATION
OF THE
EMBASSY
OF
Mon
r.
 De Chaumont, Kn
t.

TO THE
COURT
OF THE
KING of SIAM.


With an Account of whatever past
that was remarkable in his Voyage.






I Parted from 
Brest
 the third of

March,
 1685. on the King's Ship,
called the 
Hawk,
 accompanied by
one of His Majesties Frigats, named the

Maline,
 and that with so favourable a


Wind, that in seven days we arrived at
the 
Madera
 Islands; we thus happily
past on till we came to four or five de∣grees
northward of the Equinoctial
line. When we were overtaken by a
calm, and suffered extreme heats, but
which yet did not much incommode us;
the wind began again to blow, and we
past the line three hundred and fifty
degrees five minutes of longitude, thir∣ty
days after our setting out. We
found the water here to be as fresh
and good, as if it had sprang from some
pleasant fountain, which made us neg∣lect
to use that in our Jarrs. At five
degrees southward of the line we found
the Winds very inconstant, but the
heats not troublesom, and I left not
off my winter garments in all this pas∣sage.
The Winds, though variable,
yet carried us our course, so that we
arrived at the Cape of Good Hope the
31st of 
May,
 to take in fresh water,
and other Provisions, although my old
store was not exhausted. We cast an∣chor
late at night, and found in this
road four Dutch Vessels, that came
from 
Holland,
 and had on Board a Com∣missioner,


who was to order affairs in
behalf of the East-India Company.
Monsieur 
St. Martin
 Major General, a
French man, who has been in the Dutch
service this thirty years, was also in
one of these Vessels, intending for 
Ba∣tavia,

where his Employment lay. The
Commissioner General sent to comple∣ment
me the first day of my arrival; and
the next morning his Nephew and Se∣cretary,
came to offer me whatsoever 

might want. The Inhabitants of the
Countrey brought presents of Fruits
and Cattle; and the Dutch Vessels sa∣
uted
our Ships after the accustomed
manner.


The Dutch have here a small Fort,
and near an hundred Houses about a
Musquet shot off it, which are well
built, and in good order. The situati∣on
of this place is very pleasant, al∣though
bounded by a great Mountain,
inhabited by an infinite number of Mon∣kies,
which oft come down into their
Gardens, and spoil the Fruit. There
are also several Summer-houses, two
three and four leagues off in the coun∣trey;
and beyond this vast Mountain


there is plain near ten Leagues long,
where are several Houses well inhabi∣ted,
and which are every day increa∣sing.
The Climate is mild enough▪
their Spring beginning in 
October,
 and
ending in 
December,
 their Summer last


January▪ February
 and 
March,
 their
Autumn is in 
April, May, June,
 and
their Winter in 
July, August, Septem∣ber;

the heats would be very great

were they not moderated by gentle
Gales. The Dutch East-India Compa∣ny
have here a most pleasant Garden

whose great Walk is fourteen hundred
paces long, it is planted every where
thick with Citron Trees: This Garden
is ordered into Apartments; in one
of them you may see Fruit-trees, and
the rarest Plants of 
Asia,
 in the other
the most exquisite of 
Africa,
 in the
third such as are choicest in 
Europe▪

and in the fourth such Fruits and Plant

as grow in 
America.
 This Garden is
very well kept, and of good use to the
Dutch, by a great quantity of Herb

and Roots which it supplies them with
for the Refreshment of their Fleets,
when they come here to pass to the



Indies,
 or returning to their own Coun∣trey.


I found there a French Gardiner;
who had heretofore learnt his Trade
at the Gardens of Monsieur at 
St. Cloud.

The Soil is very good, and yields good
store of grain. A person, worthy cre∣dit,
has assured me he saw an hundred
and sixty Ears of Corn on one stalk.
The Inhabitants of the Countrey have
fair Countenances, but herein deceit∣full,
for they are mere bruits; they
go naked, excepting that part which
they cover with a nasty Skin of a beast.
They till not the Ground, yet abound
with Cattel, such as 
ows, Hogs
and Sheep. They scarce eat any of
these, their chiefest dyet being Milk
and Butter, which, for cleanliness
sake, they make in Sheep Skins. They
have a root which hath the taste of
the Kernel of one of our small Nuts,
which serves them for bread. They
are indifferently skilled in Simples,
which they can use in the Cure of
Wounds, and other Distempers. The
greatest Lords amongst them, are they
that have most Cattle, which they


watch and keep themselves. They of

have wars with each other about their
pastures. Are greatly annoyed with
wild Beasts, there being more than a
few Lions, Leopards, Tygers, Wolves▪
wild Dogs, Elephants, and other sa∣vage
Creatures. All their Arms are
a kind of poisoned Lance, to strike
these Beasts with. They have a kind
of Toyls wherewith they enclose their
Cattel at night: They trouble not
themselves much about Religion, yet
observe some slight Ceremonies to the
Full-moon, which do not signifie much.
Their Language seems difficult to be
understood. They have much game,
as Pheasants, Partridges, three or four
sorts, Peacocks, Hares, Coneys, and
Deer in such abundance, that some∣times
a Man shall see near twenty thou∣sand
together in a plain. We ate some
of these before mentioned, and found
them admirable good. The Sheep are
here very large, of fourscore pound
weight commonly. Here are great
quantity of Cows and Oxen. The Sea
in this Bay is full of Fish, which are of
good relish, some of them having the


taste of Salmon. This place abounds
with Sea-wolves, and when in our Shal∣lop
we perceived an infinite number
came tumbling by us, of which we
could not kill one. Several wild Horses
scamper along the plains, which, if I
mistake not, are inferiour to none in
other parts, both in strength, and beau∣tifull
colours and shapes; I brought
along with me one of their Skins;
they are hard to be mastered. This
being such a good Countrey, the 
Hol∣landers

send continually fresh people to
it, who make every season considera∣ble
discoveries. Some say they have
found out Gold and Silver Mines; of
which 'tis not to be expected they
should say much themselves. The wa∣ter
is here very good, proceeding from
several Springs, near Rivers which a∣bound,
as I already noted, with Fish.


We parted from this Road the se∣venth
of 
June,
 with so favourable a
North Wind, and North North West,
that we soon got into the open Sea,
and that night steered to 
Bantam:
 we
endured vehement Rains, and met with
great Seas, till we reached the Isles of



Madegascar,
 which was on the seven∣teenth
of 
June.
 On these Seas you per∣ceive
great quantity of Birds, but find
therein no Fish. Till 
July
 we encoun∣tred
with boisterous Seas, and met with
variable Winds, which forced us forty
degrees southward, where we found a
Western Wind, with which we made
great way. The twenty fourth the

Maline
 Frigat was separated from us
by bad weather, being driven to the
North. The third of 
August
 we found
the Sea less troublesome, and the wea∣ther
more favourable, and at break of
day discovered an Island seven or eight
leagues before us, which surprised us,
it not being described in our Chart; It
is situated ten degrees nineteen minutes
of latitude Southward. This Isle lies
convenient for the finding of the Isle of

Java,
 which cannot be distant from it
above an hundred and fifty Leagues,
and since we understood 'tis called the
Isle of 
Money,
 being ill set down in
our Maps, which place it near that of

Java.
 This Isle lies very high; we
coasted yet two days with a good gale,
and on the fifth about eight in the mor∣ning,


we discovered the Isle of 
Java

which gave us much more Joy, and the
seventh following we found our selves
between the Princes Isle, and that of
the Emperour, which make the en∣trance
of the Straits. The Isle of the
Emperour lies on the side of 
Sumatra,

and the Isle of the Prince on the side of

Java.
 We lay four days between these
Islands, the Winds and Streams oppo∣sing
us in so violent a manner, that
what we gained in twelve hours, we
lost in four, by means of calms, which
often happened. Before we entred this
Strait, the Frigat which lost us on the
twenty fourth of 
June,
 came up to our
Ship side this day, before we knew who
she was. The thirteenth we left these
Islands behind us, and cast Anchor
within a League of 
Java.
 There came
on board us several persons in little
Boats, who brought us the Countrey
Fruits, such as Coco's, the water which
is contained in them being excellent
drink, as also Melons, Citrons, and se∣veral
otherlike Presents, which much
refresht our Men, tired with the fa∣tigues


of the Sea, and over-run with
the Scurvy.


On the sixteenth in the morning we
came to 
Bantam,
 where I found the 
Ma∣line

Frigat, which tarried For me two
days: The Captain of it came and
told me, that the Governour of the
place would not give him entrance,
but onely presented him with some
Fowl and Fruits: whereupon I sent
Mr. 
De Forbin,
 my Lieutenant, to com∣pliment
this Governour from me, and
entreat him to grant me leave to land
my sick Men, to take in fresh water,
and other necessaries. He returned
answer, he was not the Master of 
Ban∣tam,

and that there was a King of the
place, who would not admit any stran∣ger
to his Countrey. The 
Hollanders

make use of this King's Name, being
unwilling that strange Vessels should
come amongst them, especially the Eu∣ropeans.
Since they have settled there,
they have driven all other Nations out.
'Tis a great Town, and well peopled
by the Natives, before the 
Hollanders

became Masters of it, 'twas the chiefest
place of the 
Indies
 for Commerce, peo∣ple


came there from 
Europe, Persia,
China, Japon,
 the Great 
Mogol
's Coun∣trey,
and divers other parts, but now
the 
Hollanders
 have got all into their
Hands, which is of vast advantage to
them; for this place may be compared
to what heretofore was 
Cales
 in 
Spain.

As soon as I received the Governour's
Answer, who yet told me, that if I
would go to 
Batavia,
 I should find
there a kind reception, I therefore
weighed Anchor, and set sail for that
place, to which there's but fifteen
Leagues. I was three days before I ar∣rived
there; for having no Pilot that
was acquainted with those parts, I fell
on several Islands, which caused me to
cast Anchor every night, and in the
day time to move with small sail, soun∣ding
all places I went over; but I arri∣ved
on the thirteenth at night, where
assoon as I had cast Anchor, I sent my
Lieutenant to the General, to comple∣ment
him, and to desire leave to bring
my sick Men on shoar, and take in re∣freshments.
He took my Complement
in good part, and returned answer, he
would take care I should be satisfied. I


sent next morning sixty five sick Men
on shoar, who all recovered their
healths in seven days that I tarried at

Batavia.
 On the nineteenth in the
morning the General sent me a Comple∣ment
by three Officers, the Summ of
which was to desire me to come on
shoar, offering me his own House to
lodge
 in. After necessary Thanks, I
answered, I wished my Orders would
have permitted me that Liberty. The
General sent me a great Shalop, laden
with all sorts of Indian Fruits, Herbs,
new Bread, two Oxen, two Sheep, and
thus continued for several days presen∣ting
us. On the twenty second I lan∣ded

incognito,
 and viewed the Town in
a small Boat. 'Tis like 
Venice,
 having
Chanels which run through every street,
and planted with great Trees which
yield an agreeable shade, as well to the
Chanels as the Streets; the Houses are
built as they are in 
Holland;
 there is a
Citadel indifferently well fortified; the
Town in enclosed with a Wall, and
great Ditch, but not deep. The Hou∣ses
round about it are extreme pleasant,
being related to curious Gardens, and


Fish-ponds, wherein are admirable Fish
of all sorts. In this Town the Traders
are exceeding rich, and spare no cost

or their Delight, neither do they de∣
y
themselves unlawfull satisfaction
with Women. I took the liberty my
self to entertain four or five of them

t divers times, in my walks in the gar∣
ens;
their dresses are like the French.
There is in 
Batavia
 about fifty Coaches,
some of which are very stately; their
Horses are none of the biggest, but to
make amends, are in so good plight,

hat they need no spur. This Town

s a place of vast Commerce, and its
Riches are so great, that the Inhabi∣
ants
need not be sparing of their Mo∣ney;
'tis well peopled, and the Dutch
keep a strong Garison; they have there

ear three thousand Moors, who are

laves, and several of the Natives they

eep under their Obedience, who live

bout the Town. The Isle of 
Java,
 in
which this City is situated, is very po∣pulous,
contains two hundred Leagues

n length, and forty in breadth; it has
five Kings, over whom the 
Hollanders


re Masters; they are Mahometans. I


sent to the General for a Pilot for 
Siam,

mine having never been there; he lent
me one who had sailed there four times;
for these civilities, I sent Mr. 
Forbin
 to
thank him.


On 
Sunday,
 being the twenty sixth
of 
August,
 at six of the Clock in the
morning, we set sail, and steered our
course to pass the Strait of 
Banca;
 we
advanced that day ten Leagues with a
small Wind, and at nine at night I was
told of a Sail that made towards my
Vessel, whereupon I bid the Officer be
prepared; when immediately I saw out
of my Window this Ship coming up to
us: we called out to know what she
was, but could have no answer, and
coming on the Deck, I found all our
Men provided for her, and the Bolt-sprit
of this Ship laid on cross my
Stern, I caused about twenty Musquet
Shot to be fired among her Men, which
immediately made her clear her self
of us, and taking the advantage of the
Wind, and clapping on all her Sails,
we knew not what Nation she was of,
for no body in the Ship spoke one
word, and we observed but few Men on


board her. I suppose her to have been
some Merchant Ship, guided by unskil∣full
hands; they did our Ship some
mischief, but the damage was repaired
next morning.


On 
Tuesday,
 being the twenty eighth,
at night we discovered the entrance of
the Strait of 
Banca,
 and on the twenty
ninth in the morning we entred there∣in.
Although we had a good Dutch
Pilot, yet we ran upon a muddy bank
of Sand, there being many of this kind
in this Strait, and ti being usual for
Vessels to meet with them without
much hurt, therefore this did not much
disturb us, for I caused a small Anchor
to be cast on the side of 
Sumatra,
 and
in less than two hours we got off clear
from this Bank. We were three days
passing this Strait. The Isle of 
Suma∣tra

is on the left, and contains two
hundred and fifty Leagues in length,
and about fifty in breadth. The 
Hol∣landers

have four or five Fortresses here,
its people are Mahometans, and under
the Regiment of five or six Kings. The
Queen of 
Achem
 possesses one of the lar∣gest
Countries, and governs with great


Authority and Regularity. The 
Hol∣landers

are in a manner Masters of all
these Princes, they deal with them for
whatsoever the Island yields, where 'tis
said there are golden Mines, great
quantities of Pepper, Rice, all sorts of
Cattle, and in some Cantons the peo∣ple
are very barbarous, and the Kings
are oft at war one with one another.
Those who receive the 
Hollanders
 pro∣tection
are ever the strongest: 'Tis the
same in the Isle of 
Java,
 for three hun∣dred
Europeans do beat five or six thou∣sand
Men of these Nations, who know
not tho Art of War. It lies four de∣grees
Southward of the Equinoctial
Line. The Dutch have a Fort on the
side of the Strait of 
Banca,
 strengthe∣ned
with twenty four pieces of Canon;
the Fort is built upon the River called

Palembone,
 which runs so violently into
the Sea, that three or four months in
the year, in rainy weather, the water
of it, when in the Sea, does yet keep
its freshness.


The Isle of 
Banca
 lay on the right
hand of us, being about fourty Leagues
long; The Dutch have a Fort there,


and drive a considerable Trade with
the Natives of the Countrey; 'tis said
to be a very good and fruitfull Coun∣trey,
when I sailed by the River of 
Pa∣lembone,

the Dutch were there lading
two Vessels with Pepper. On the third
of 
September
 we past the Line again by
the help of good weather, the air be∣ing
temperate, and without excessive
Heats, so that I still wore my Cloth
suit, till I past over to the Coasts of

Africa.
 We came before the Strait of

Malaca,
 which has four or five passa∣ges,
or entrances, but the Streams were
so great, and running sometimes against
us, that we were forced oft to cast An∣thor;
for when the Calm took us, the
Streams forcibly carried us a great di∣stance;
but we left not this Coast, by
reason of the Winds, which always

low from the land, and greatly hel∣ped
us in our course. I believe this
Countrey's Air to be good, for we had
many sick, who were all recovered by

t.


On the fifth we discovered the Isle
of 
Polimon,
 which is inhabited by 
Ma∣laises,

who are Mahometans. This is a


plentifull Countrey, and obedient to a
Prince by whom 'tis governed. The
Queen of 
Achem
 has some pretensions to
it, and for this effect she sends thither
every year some Vessels; but this Prince
being not willing to engage in a War
against her, his people pay her Tribute.
There came a small Boat to our Ship
side, which brought us some Fish and
Fruits. This Isle is distant from the
Continent about six Leagues, part of
its Coasts was heretofore subject to the
King of 
Siam;
 but it has been since
some years in the possession of two or
three Kings, one of which is the King
of 
Malais.
 This is a very unsociable
Nation, and will enter into no Com∣merce.


From the fifth to the fifteenth we had
but small Winds, and very variable, and
Calms which caused us oft to cast An∣chor,
as also by reason of Streams which
run along this Coast. From the Strait
of 
Banca
 to 
Siam
 the Land is not wont
to be left.


The same day we found our selves
before 
Ligor,
 which is the chief place
belonging to the King of 
Siam.
 The



Hollanders
 have a habitation there, and
liberty of Trade. 'Tis hard to ex∣press
the Joy which the 
Siamoises
 whom
we brought along with us had to see
their own Countrey, and it cannot be
better compared than to that which
we felt at our return, when God
brought us safe to 
Brest.
 Here died
a young Gentleman having been ill
five months with a bloudy Flux, whom
the King sent to attend me in my
Voyage, he was a Youth of great hopes,
and I was much afflicted at the loss of
him.


In short (thanks be to God) on the
twenty fourth we cast Anchor before
the River of 
Siam.
 Our whole Ship's
crew were in good health. I sent to the
Bishop of 
Metellopolis
 Mr. 
le Vacher
 a
Missionary, who came with the 
Man∣darins

into 
France,
 and whom I brought
along with them, with charge to en∣treat
him to come to me that I might
learn what had happened this eighteen
months since the King of 
Siam
 sent
into 
France.


On the twenty ninth the Bishop
came on board with the Abbat of



Lionne,
 who informed me of whatsoever
had past, telling me that the King of

Siam
 having heard at midnight of my
arrival by Mr. 
Constance
 one of his
Ministers, he shewed great joy, and
ordered him to go and advertise the
Bishop of it, and to dispatch two 
Man∣darins

of the first rank, who are in a
manner as the chief Gentlemen of the
King's Chamber are in 
France,
 to assure
me of the joy he conceived at my ar∣rival.
They came two days after on
board me, whom I received in my
Cabin; the Bishop sitting by me, and
they and others sitting down on Carpets
laid on the floor, it being the custome
of the Country to sit in that manner,
there being no person but the King
who sits higher.


They told me the King their Master
had commanded them to shew me the
Joy he had at my arrival, and at the
News of our King's having vanquished
all his Enemies, and become absolute
Master of his Kingdom. Having de∣noted
to them how much I thought
my self beholden to the King their
Master, and answered what they of∣fered


touching our Prince, I told them
I was extremely satisfied with the
Governor of 
Bancok,
 for his reception
of those I sent him, as also with the
Presents he had made me. They reply∣ed
he had done onely his duty, seeing
in 
France
 the King their Master's Envoys
had been so well received, and that
moreover I merited this good usage by
my procurement of an Union between
the Kings of 
Siam
 and of 
France.

Having treated them with the honours
and civilities usual in such like occasions
in these Countries, I presented them
with Tea and Comfits. These two

Mandarins
 were well shap'd Men, of
about 25 years of Age, and Apparelled
after their mode, being bare headed,
without Shoes or Stockings, wearing
a kind of long Scarf down to their
Knees and coming between their Legs
was fastned behind. This Scarf was
of painted linen neatly done, and em∣broidred
at the edges; from the waste
upwards, they had nothing but a kind
of Muslin wastcoat, which they let
hang over this Scarf, the sleeves being
somewhat large, but not long. They


remained about an hour on board our
Vessel, and I saluted them with nine
pieces of Canon at their departure.


On the ninth of 
October
 Mr. 
Constance,

the King of 
Siam
's Minister I lately
mentioned, and who though a stranger,
has obtained by his merit the chief
place in the King's favour, sent to
Complement me by his Secretary who
was an honest man, and offered me from
himself such a great present of Fruits,
besides Oxen, Hoggs, Pullets, Ducks
and such like things, that all the Ships
crew were fed with them for four days
together. These refreshments are
gratefull when a man has been seven
or eight months at Sea.


On the eighth the Bishop of 
Metel∣lopolis

who had returned to the chief
City of 
Siam,
 came on board us again
with two 
Mandarin's
 to enquire as
from the King after my Health, and
to inform me how impatiently he took
my delays of seeing him, entreating
me to hasten on shore. I returned their
Complement, and told them I should
soon be there. I gave these 
Manda∣rins

the same Entertainment I gave the


first, saluting them also at their depar∣ture
with nine pieces of Canon. About
two of the Clock the same day I went
into my Shalop, and those of my At∣tendance
into Boats which the King had

ent; being arrived at night in the
River, I found five Barges, one for my
self, which was a very magnificent one,
and the four others for the Gentlemen
which accompanied me, with several
others to carry the rest of my Retinue

nd Goods. Two 
Mandarins
 came
and Complemented me from the King.

 could not reach that night the place

esigned for my Reception, which
obliged me to pass out of the Barge

nto the 
Maline
 Frigat, which had

ntred the River two days before, on

oard of which I lay all night.


The same Evening a person whom 

had sent to 
Siam
 to buy such Pro∣visions
as we needed, came and told
me that Mr. 
Constance
 had delivered to
him from the King eleven Barks full
of Oxen, Sheep, Calves, Ducks, Pul∣lets
and Strong-water made with
Rice, together with a Request that I
would not spare to ask for what we


wanted, for we should be supplye

all the time we tarryed in the King∣dom,
at his Majesty's charge.


On the ninth there came two 
Man∣darins

to my Barge from the King, who
told me they came for my orders, and
I parted from this place about seven i

the morning. Having went about fiv

leagues, I came to a house built 

purpose for my entertainment, whe

two 
Mandarins,
 and the Governour

of 
Bancok
 and 
Pipely
 with several other

were ready to receive me. This Hous

was made with 
Bamboos,
 and covere

with neat Matts. All the Furniture 

it was new; it contained severa

Chambers hung with fine painted line

the Floor of my Room was covere

with Tapstry, the Chairs were curiou
∣ly
wrought and gilt, as also the Table

to speak nothing of the neatness 

the Bed; I was here served with choic

Meats and delicate Fruits. I left thi

place after Dinner, and all the 
Man∣darins

followed me. I went to 
Bancok

which is the chief place the King 


Siam
 has on this River, distant abou

twelve leagues from the Sea. I foun



here an 
English
 Vessel, which saluted
me with his Cannon, which were an∣swered
by the Forts which defend
both sides of the River; which Forts
are regular enough, and well furnished
with Guns. I lodged in a House well
built and furnisht, where I was treated
after the fashion of the Countrey.


The next Morning I parted at eight of
the clock attended by all the 
Mandarins

and Governours who were come to
complement me. At my departure I
was also saluted by the Cannon, and
arrived at Noon in a House built on
purpose for me, and as well furnisht
as the former. There was near ad∣joyning
two Fortresses which saluted
me with all their Guns, and two 
Man∣darins

more came to receive me. I
was very well served at Dinner; and
I parted here at three a clock, and
the Governour of 
Bancok
 took his
leave of me to return to his charge.
Holding on my course I came to two
Ships the one 
English
 and the other

Dutch
 lying at anchor, who also dis∣charged
all their Cannon, and I arrived
at seven at night at a convenient House


furnished after the same manner as the
preceding ones, where I was received
and treated by other 
Mandarins.


The eleventh in the morning I par∣ted
thence, and went and dined in
another House, and at night I lay and
was treated as before.


On the twelfth I lodged two Leagues
off of 
Siam,
 where I was again recei∣ved
by two 
Mandarins.
 The princi∣pal
Merchants of the 
English
 and 
Dutch

Companies came to complement my
arrival in those parts, and as to the

French
 they attended me all the way. 
Here I remained till I made my en∣trance.


The River of 
Siam
 called 
Menon
 is
very large and commodious, being
adorned all along the sides of it with
pleasant Trees; but three or four
months in the Year all these places
are overflowed with water, and there∣fore
all the Houses are built on a kind
of sledges, and made all of 
Bamboos.

This wood serves the 
Siamoises
 both
for the foundations and tops of their
houses, and for infinite purposes be∣sides,
making use of it as we do


Flints and Steels, for they need onely
take a little of this wood on a heap,
and rub it together, and it presently
lights. All the people of these parts
have little Boats to pass from one
house to another for what they want.
Here are seen none but Women to
work, the Men being for the most part
employed in the Kings service, whose
Slaves they are. I had the same honours
shewed me, as to the King when he is
wont to pass on the River. I could
see no body in the houses, all people
were in Barges, or on the side of the
River, lying flat on their Bellies, and
their hands joyned against their fore∣heads.
They reverence in such a
manner their Prince, that they dare
not lift up their eyes to look on him.
I observed that the houses where I
lodged were painted with red, that I
might be treated as his own person,
there being onely the Royal Houses
of that colour.


All the 
Mandarins
 which came to
receive me on the River, still accom∣panied
me. The Princes also visited
me. They have all convenient Barges,


in the middle of which there is a kind
of Throne whereon they sit, and they
usually go but one in a Barge, on both
sides of them are their Arms, as Scimi∣tars,
Swords and Darts, and even Forks.
They are all cloathed in the manner
I already mentioned. A 
Portuguese

whom the King had made General
of the Troops in 
Bancok
 continually
accompanied me, and gave orders for
all things. I was attended with near
fifty or sixty Barges, some of which
were fifty, sixty, seventy and eighty
foot long▪ having Oars from twenty
to an hundred. They row not after
our manner, they sit two on each bench,
one on one side and another on the
other, their Faces turned on that side
where they go, and have a Scul which
they call 
Pagais,
 being about four foot
long, with which they take a world
of pains, being contented with sod
Rice, and if they have a piece of Fish,
they believe they Dine sumptuously.


They eat of a Leaf which they call

Betel,
 which is like Ivy, and a kind of
Corn which they call 
Arrek,
 putting
Lime thereon, and this gives it a taste.


They eat the Tobacco growing in
their Countrey, which is very strong,
all which blackens their Teeth, which
they esteem the handsomest. A man
may live after this rate for fifteen
pence a month for they usually drink
nothing but water. They have a kind
of 
Aqua vitae,
 which they call 
Rack,

made with Rice. When I came to a
House which was intended for me,
all the 
Mandarins
 that accompanied me
made a lane for me to pass through to
my Chamber door.


On the thirteenth I sent word to
the King by the 
Mandarins
 that were
with me, that I had been informed of
the manner wherewith they were wont
to receive Ambassadors, and it being
very different from that of 
France,

I entreated him to send me somebody
to instruct me about my entrance.


On the fourteenth he sent me the Sieur

Constance,
 with whom I had a long con∣versation,
the Bishop of 
Metropolis

being our Interpreter. We had a tedi∣ous
dispute, and I would bate nothing of
the mode of receiving Ambassadors in

France,
 which at length he granted me.



On the fifteenth the 
Tunquinoises
 came
to complement me on my arrival.


The sixteenth the 
Cochinchinoises
 did
the same.


The seventeenth Mr. 
Constance
 came
to me, and brought with him four
stately Barges to carry the Presents
which his Majesty sent to the King of

Siam.
 And on the same day the King
gave order to all the 
Indian
 Nations
that reside at 
Siam,
 to congratulate
my arrival, and to pay me all the
espect which is due to the character
of an Ambassador to so great a King.
They came to me at six at night,
each of them habited after their own
manner; there were of forty different
Nations, and each of them of King∣doms
independent one of another, and
that which seemed most remarkable,
was that among the rest there was the
son of a King who was driven out of
his Countrey, and taking 
Siam
 for
his refuge, entreated assistance toward
his re-establishment; their dresses were
the same as the 
Siamoises,
 some ha∣ving
Turbants, others 
Armenian
 Bon∣nets,
and others bare-headed, like the


common 
Siamoises;
 persons of quality
having Bonnets of the same fashion of
our Dragoons, made of white Muslin
which tye under their Chins with a
string, being all of them barefooted.


The King made Mr. 
Constance
 tell
me, that he would give me Audience
the next morning, being the eighteenth.
I set out at seven of the clock in the
morning in the manner which I shall
relate, having first recited the honour
wherewith the King of 
Siam
 received
the King of 
France
's Letter. 'Tis true
he is wont to receive with respect the
Letters delivered him by Ambassadors
of foreign Potentates, but he would
give a distinct honour to that of our
great Monarch. There came forty of the
chiefest 
Mandarins
 in the Court, two of
which were 
Oyas,
 which is to say Dukes,
who told me that all the Barges were
ready to receive his Majesty's Letter,
and carry my self to the Palace.
The Letter was in my Chamber in
a golden Cabinet; the 
Mandarins
 ha∣ving
entred prostrated themselves,
their hands closed and adjoyning to
their foreheads, and their faces to∣wards


the ground, and saluted in this
posture the King's Letter for three
times together. I being seated on a
Throne near the Letter, received this
honour, which was never paid to any
but his Majesty of 
France,
 which Ce∣remony
being ended, I took the Let∣ter
with the golden Cabinet, and ha∣ving
carried it seven or eight paces,
I gave it to the Abbat of 
Choisy,

who came from 
France
 with me. He
walkt at my right hand a little behind,
and carried it to the water side,
where I found a curious Barge, sump∣tuously
gilded, in which were two

Mandarins
 of the chief rank. I took
the Letter from Mr. 
Choisy,
 and ha∣ving
carried it into the Barge with
me, I put it into the hands of these

Mandarins,
 who laid it on a stately
raised Table gilt; I entred into ano∣ther,
a very magnificent one, which
followed immediately that wherein
was the Letter of his Majesty. Two
others also as stately as mine, in which
were 
Mandarins,
 rowed on either side
of that where the Letter was. Mine,
as I now said, followed after Mr. 
Choisy,



the Abbat was in another Barge next
to mine, and the Gentlemen which
accompanied me, and others of my re∣tinue
in other Barges: Those of the
Great 
Mandarins
 likewise were very
fine, and were on head of us. There
were about twelve gilt Barges, and near
two hundred others that followed us.
The King's Letter, the two Barges that
attended it, and mine, were in the mid∣dle.
All the Nations at 
Siam
 were at∣tending,
and the whole River, although
very large, was covered with Barges.
We moved after this rate to the Town,
whose Cannons were discharged, which
never was done to any other Ambassa∣dour,
all the Ships saluted me likewise,
and at landing, I found a great golden
Chariot▪ which onely the King rode in.

 took His Majesty's Letter, and laid

 into this Chariot, which was drawn
by Horses led by Men▪ I afterwards
went into a glorious Chair, which was
carried by ten Men on their Shoulders;
the Abbat of 
Choisy▪
 was also in a∣nother,
but of less finery; the Gen∣tlemen
and 
Mandarins
 which accompa∣nied
me, were on Horseback, all the


several Nations which dwell at 
Siam

walking on foot behind; the Procession
was in this wise to the Castle, where
I found the Souldiers, who were drawn
up on each side of the Street, having
Head-pieces gilt with Gold, red Shirts
on, and a kind of Scarf of painted cloth,
which served them for Breeches, but
having neither Shoes nor Stockings:
Some of them were armed with Mus∣quets,
others with Lances, others with
Bows and Arrows, and lastly, some
with Pikes.


There wanted not musical instru∣ments,
as Trumpets, Drums, Tim∣brels,
Pipes, little Bells and Horns,
which Musick made a pleasant noise;
and thus marched we the length of a
great Street, through an infinite num∣ber
of People. We came at lenght to
a great open place in which stood the
King's Palace, where were ranged on
each side Elephants of War: We af∣terwards
entred into the first Court of
the Palace, where I saw about two thou∣sand
Souldiers in a posture of sitting,
with the Butt-end of their Musquets to
the ground standing upright, they were


placed six in a rank, in a direct line:
There were on the left several armed
Elephants, ready for War. We after∣wards
saw an hundred Men on Horse∣back,
naked, and clothed after the Moo∣rish
Fashion, having a Lance in their
Hands; all the Souldiers were accou∣tred
as I already mentioned; in this
place those of foreign Nations left me,
excepting some Gentlemen who accom∣panied
me all the way. I past into two
other Courts which were garrisoned af∣ter
the same manner, and I entred in∣to
another, where was a great number
of 
Mandarins,
 all of them prostrate on
the ground; here were six Horses held,
each of them by two 
Mandarins;
 they
were well harnest, all their Trappings
being of Gold and Silver, covered with
Pearls, Rubies and Diamonds, so thick
that a Man could scarce see the leather;
their Stirrups and Saddles were of Gold
and Silver, and the Horses had golden
Rings on their Feet; there were also
several Elephants harnessed in the same
manner the Coach Horses were. The
Gentlemen entred into the Hall of Au∣dience,
and placed themselves before


the King came into his Throne, and
when he was there attended with
Mr. 
Constans, du Barcalon,
 and the Ab∣bat
of 
Choisy▪
 who carried the King's
Letter, I was surprised to see him on
a higher Throne, for Mr. 
Constans
 had
agreed with me, that the King should
be on a Throne no higher than where
I might give my Letter with my own
hand, without straining my self; then
I told the Abbat 
de Choisy,
 the pro∣mise
they made me was forgotten, but
that I would not give the King my
Letter in this manner; the golden Ca∣binet
wherein 'twas put had a great
Handle, three foot long; 'twas imagi∣ned
I would take hold on it, thus to raise
it to the King's Throne, but I was resol∣ved
to present His Majesty's Letter to
the King in a befitting manner: Being
then come to the Door, I saluted the
King, the like I did also in the mid
way, and when I was near the place
where I was to sit; having uttered
two words of my Harangue, I put my
Hat on, and sate down, and continued
my Discourse in these Terms.










AN
HARANGUE
TO THE
KING of SIAM.


SIR,


THE King, my Master, who is now
so famous in the World, by
his great Victories, and the Peace
he has often granted his Enemies at
the head of his Armies, has com∣manded
me to come to Your Maje∣sty,
to assure you of the particular
Esteem he has for you.


He knows, Sir, Your princely
Qualities, the Wisedom of your Go∣vernment,
the Magnificence of your
Court, the Grandeur of your States,
and especially the Goodwill You bear
His Person, demonstrated by the
continual Favour and Protection You
shew His Subjects, especially to the


religious Emissaries who are God's
Ambassadors.


He experiences so many marks of
kindness from you, as makes him
ready to offer the most suitable re∣turns,
to keep a continual correspon∣dence
with you, to entertain and en∣crease
a Commerce with Your Sub∣jects,
but especially to begin an Union
between the two Crowns, which will
be the more famous to posterity, by
Your Countrey's lying so distant
from His, by the vast Seas which se∣parate
them.


But nothing will so much keep
Him in this resolution, and more
unite Him to You, than to live to∣gether
in the same Opinions and
Belief.


And this is, Sir, what the King
my Master, who is so wise and en∣lightened
a Prince, and who has ne∣ver
failed in his Advice to the Kings
his Allies, has especially enjoined me
to recommend to You.


He conjures you, as one of his sin∣cerest
Friends, and by the Interest
which he has in your Wellfare, to


consider that this supreme Majesty
with which You are endued on earth,
can come onely from the true God,
that is to say, from a Being Almigh∣ty,
Eternal and Incomprehensible,
such as the Christians acknowledge,
by whom alone Kings do reign, and
who subdueth the People that are un∣der
them. Submit Your Greatness to
this God, who governs Heaven and
Earth; this is what's far more rea∣sonable
than to adore Idols, so cu∣stomary
in this Countrey, of whose
insignificany Your Majesty's Great
Judgment cannot chuse but be sensi∣ble.


But Your Majesty will more clear∣ly
perceive this, if You would be
pleased to hear the Missionaries who
are ready to serve You.


The best news, Sir, I can carry
home to the King my Master, is, that
Your Majesty being convinced of the
reality of what I say, has made far∣ther
enquiries into the Christian Re∣ligion,
and given Your Name up to
it; and what Honour will this bring
to You, Sir, what Assurance will it


give to Your Estates, and what
Happiness will it lead You to at
the last?








This Harangue was interpreted by
Monr. 
Constans;
 I afterwards told His
Majesty, that the King my Master
had given me the Abbat 
de Chaisy,

and those twelve Gentlemen for my
Company, whom I presented to him.
I took the Letter from the Hands of
the Abbat 
de Choisy,
 and carried it in
the design of presenting it, no other∣wise
than I before mentioned, Mr. 
Con∣stans,

who accompanied me, crawling
and jumping on his Hands and Feet,
called out to me, and making Signs I
should stretch out my Arm as well as
the King, I made as if I understood not
what was told me, when the King, smi∣ling,
arose, and stooped down to take
the Letter out of the Cabinet, and that
in such a manner as one might see his
whole Body; assoon as he had taken it,
I made my Obeisance, and retired to my
Seat▪ The King enquired of the Health
of His Majesty, and all the Royal Fami∣ly,
and whether the King had made any


Conquest of late, I told him he had
gained 
Luxembourg,
 an impregnable
place, and the most considerable the

Spaniards
 held in that Countrey, which
shut up the Frontiers of 
France,
 and
opened a way to those who might be∣come
his Enemies, and that he had late∣ly
agreed to a Peace with all 
Eu∣rope,

when at the Head of his Armies.
The King replied, he was glad of our
King's Victories, and the Peace he en∣joyed;
he added he had sent Ambassa∣dours
to 
France,
 who embarked at 
Ban∣tam,

in the 
Rising Sun;
 that he would
seek all ways to give the King satis∣faction
in every thing I offered him:
The Bishop of 
Metellopolis
 was present,
who interpreted several Questions the
King made me. This Monarch had a
Crown enriched with Diamonds, fa∣stened
on a Cap, which stood up above
the Crown like almost to our Dragoons,
his Vest was of a very rich flowered
Stuff, wrought with Gold, and embroi∣der'd,
at the Neck and Sleeves with Dia∣monds,
which lookt like a kind of Col∣lar
and Bracelets. He had a great many
Diamond Rings on his fingers; I can∣not


say what kind of Shoes or Stocking
he had on, having onely in this Audi∣ence
seen half his Body. He had four∣score

Mandarins
 in his Parlor, where 

was, all prostrate on the ground, and
who never left this posture all this
while.


The King is about fifty five years of
age, well shaped, somewhat tanned,
as all of those Countreys are, having
a chearfull countenance; his inclinati∣ons
are Royal, he is couragious, a great
Politician, governing alone, magnifi∣cent,
liberal, a Lover of Arts, in a
word, a Prince, who by his Wit has
freed himself from diverse Customer
which he found in his Kingdom, bor∣rowing
of strange Countreys, and espe∣cially
of 
Europe,
 whatsoever he thought
might most contribute to the Honour
and Happiness of his Reign.


These 
Mandarins,
 whom I now men∣tioned,
had neither Shoes nor Stoc∣kins,
and were apparelled like those I
have heretofore spoke of, with Caps,
like the King's, and each of them had a
Box, wherein he put his 
Betel, Arreck,

and Tobacco. By these Boxes a Man


may distinguish their Qualities and
Ranks, some differing from others. Af∣fter
the King had discoursed with me an
hour, he shut his Window, and I reti∣red.
The place of Audience was about
twelve or fifteen steps high, 'twas fine∣ly
painted within with flowers of Gold,
from the top to the bottom, the Floor
was covered with rich Tapestry; at
the end of this Parlor there were two
pair of large Stairs on each hand, which
led into the Chamber where the King
was, in the middle of these two pair of
Stairs are Windows to which you must
go up some steps, before which there
were three great Umbrella's, they were
of Cloth of Gold, and their Sticks
painted with Gold, one was in the
middle of the Window, and the two
others on both sides, 'tis through this
Window we saw the King's Throne,
and through which he gave me Audi∣ence.
Mr. 
Constans
 carried me after∣wards
to view the rest of the Palace,
where I saw the white Elephant, who
ate and drank out of Gold, I saw also
others, very fine ones, after which I
returned to my Lodging in the same


Pomp wherein I came, which House was
well enough, and all my retinue were
well accommodated in it. I was infor∣med
that Mr. 
Constans
 had given order
from the King to all the 
Mandarins
 

foreign Nations that dwell in his King∣dom,
to come to these Lodgings and
being there he told them the King was
minded they should see in what distinct
manner he treated the Ambassadours
of 
France,
 and those of other Nations▪
This distinction being due to the King
of 
France,
 a most mighty Monarch, and
who knew to requite the Civilities
shewed him. These 
Mandarins
 were
astonished, and answered, they had ne∣ver
seen an Ambassadour from 
France,

and were persuaded that the singular re∣ception
which the King gave him was
due to the Character of so great a
Prince, seeing his Victories have long
since been known to the remotest parts
of the World; and therefore they were
not surprised at the King's distinction.
At the same time Mr. 
Constans
 ordered
them from the King to come and com∣plement
me.



The same day at night Mr. 
Constans


an e again to see me, and then we
had a longer conversation. There were

n my Lodgings a great number of

Mandarins
 and 
Siamoises
 as a guard,
and to furnish us what things we needed,
at the King's charge.


On the ninteenth there came a great
many 
Mandarins
 to attend me, and
Mr. 
Constans
 with a Present of Fruits,
and of that Countreys Sweet-meats.


The same day the Bishop of 
Metello∣polis

was sent for by the King to inter∣pret
his Majesty's Letter.


On the twenty second the King
sent me several pieces of strip'd Satin,
morning Gowns of Japon, and a set
of Gold buttons, and to the Gentle∣men
which accompanied me some stuffs
of Gold and Silver, Indian work;
the King's custome being to present at
one's arrival Stuffs wherewith to make
Cloaths after the fashion of the Coun∣trey:
But as for my part I made no new
Cloaths, and there were onely the
Gentlemen of my train, who did it:
At night being accompained by the
Bishop, I went to give a visit to
Mr. 
Constans.



On the twenty fourth the King se

me word he would give me Audien

the next morning.


On the twenty fifth I came to the
Palace with all my, Train together
with the Bishop, the King gave me 

particular Audience, wherein he told
me many things, of which I gave a

account to his Majesty. I Dined 

the Palace Garden under great Tree

and I was served with several Dishe

of Meat and Fruits; the chief 
Manda∣rins,

as the great Treasurer, the Cap∣tains
of the King's Guards, and other

attended us; this Treat held three o

four hours, and there was in the Gar∣den
a Pond, in which there were 

great many rare Fish, and among

others there was one which represented
the countenance of a man.


On the twenty ninth I went to give
a visit to the 
Barcalon,
 who is the King's
chief Minister, who seemed to me to be
a man of sense, the Bishop accompa∣nied
me, and was Interpreter to us both


On the thirtieth I went to the Palac

to see the 
Pagod,
 or the King of 
Siam▪

domestick Temple, there was then i



the Court of the Palace a Combat, or to
speak better, an Elephant fight, for
the Elephants were tyed by the two
hind feet, on each of them rode two
men, who held in their hands a crook
with which they governed them, as
Horses are managed by a bridle, they
struck them several times to animate
them, and the Elephants had fought
well no question, had they had liberty,
they onely gave one another blows
with their teeth and trunks; the King
was there present, but I did not see
him: We past through this Court into
several others, and afterwards came
into the 
Pagod,
 the Portal appeared
to be ancient and well wrought, the
whole building indifferent handsome,
and of the form of our Churches in

Europe;
 we saw several Statues of Brass
gilt which seemed to offer sacrifices
to a great Idol all of Gold, about
forty foot high, on the side of which
Idol, there were several other small
ones, some of which being also of
Gold, had lighted Lamps fastned
into them, from the top to the bottom
of them. At the end of this 
Pagod,



there is another great Idol on a stately
Tombestone: I afterwards went into a∣nother

Pagod
 adjoyning to the first,
and I past under into a Vault like a
Cloister, where there were Idols on
each hand gilded, who had each o

them a Lamp burning before them,
which the 
Talapoins,
 which are the
Priests of 
Siam,
 do light every night.
In this 
Pagod
 was the Tomb of the
deceased Queen who died about four
or five years since; 'tis magnificent
enough, and behind this Tomb, was
another of this present King's Prede∣cessor's,
represented by a great Statue
lying on one side and drest as Kings
are wont to be in days of Ceremony;
this Statue is about twenty five foot
long, 'twas of Brass gilt; I went far∣ther
into other places where there
were a great many of these Statues,
both of Gold and Silver: several had
rich Dimond Rings and Rubies on their
fingers; I never saw so many Images
and so much Gold.


I afterwards went to see the Ele∣phants,
there is a great number of
them, and who are of a prodigious


size. I saw a piece of Cannon, cast
at 
Siam,
 of eighteen foot long, and
that would carry bullets of three hun∣dred
pound weight; there is a great
many Cannons which they make them∣selves
in this Kingdom.


The thirty first was a day of rejoy∣cing
for the King of 
Portugal
's coming
to the Crown, which was solemnised
by the letting off the great Guns and
several shews of Fire-works from on
board the 
Portugal
 Vessels.


The next morning being the first of

November,
 Mr. 
Constans
 invited me to a
great Feast, which was made as a farther
continuation of the former Solemnity,
to which I went, and all the Europeans
in the Town, the Guns ceased not
from firing all that day: after Dinner
there was a Comedy, the 
Chianoises

began the Postures, there were 
Siamoi∣ses

in it, but I knew not what they
said, their gestures seemed to me ridi∣culous,
and far unlike those amongst us;
yet there were two men, who ascended
to the top of two Perches which were
hung very high, which had at their
end a little Apple, and standing up∣right


on the top of them, they shewed
several strange tricks. Afterwards we
had a kind of Puppet play, which
yielded small diversion.


On the fourth being Sunday Mr. 
Con∣stans

told me that the King was to go
to the 
Pagod,
 where he is wont to go
every year, and prayed me to see him
pass by. I went with him and all my
Attendance; and having remained
there a while, there appeared a great
gilded Barge, in which was a 
Manda∣rin

who came to see whether all things
were in order: scarcely was he past by,
but I saw several Barges wherein were
the 
Mandarins
 of the first rank, who
were all of them in Suits of red cloath;
they are wont on these solemn days to
be all cloathed with the same colour,
and 'tis the King who nominates it;
they had white Bonnets on, very high
crown'd, and the 
Oyas
 had at the bot∣tom
of their Caps a golden Fringe,
as to their Breeches, 'twas a kind of
Scarf, as I already said. After them
came those of the second rank, the Life
Guards, several Souldiers, and then the
King in a Barge attended with two


others which were very fine ones; the
Watermen were apparelled like the
Souldiers, but onely they had a kind
of breast and back-plates, and each
of them an helmet on their heads,
which is said to be of Gold; their 
Pagais

or Sculs were gilt with Gold, as all
the Barges were, which shewed very
fine; there were an hundred and four∣score
and five Rowers in each of these
Barges, and in those of the 
Mandarins

about an hundred, and an hundred and
twenty; there were Guards that follow∣ed,
and several other 
Mandarins
 who
made the rear Guard; the King was
richly Apparelled with several pretious
Stones, I saluted him in passing by, and
he returned my complement, his Train
consisted of an hundred and forty state∣ly
Barges, which appeared very finely
indeed on the water, marching all in
good order. After Dinner I went
into my Barge to see the rest of the
Ceremony, at night the King changed
his Barge, and proposed a prize to
that Barge that should first arrive by
force of Oars to the Palace, he him∣self
was one of the party, and he ad∣vanced


by much before the others, so
that his Rowers won the money; I know
not how great 'twas, the other Barges
past on very swiftly, all the River was
covered with them who came to see
the King; that day being designed for
his shewing himself to his People, I
believe there were an hundred thou∣sand
to see him.


At night there were Fire-works for
joy of the Coronation of the King of

England,
 the whole affair was well
carried on, and strange Vessels fired
from all parts their Cannon.


On the fifth this Feast continued,
and the Cannon was fired from all
parts of the Town, Mr. 
Constans
 in∣vited
me to Dinner, where all the Eu∣ropeans
were, where I was made very
welcome.


On the eighth the King parted for

Louvo,
 which is a Countrey Seat where
he generally remains for eight or nine
months in the year, it being distant
twenty Leagues from 
Siam.


On the fifteenth I parted for that
place, I lay in the way at a House
which was built for me, 'twas in the


same form as that where I had been
Lodged all along, 'twas near where the
King lyes when he goes to 
Louvo.
 I
remained there all the sixteenth, and
on the seventeenth set out thither,
where I arrived the same day on eight
at night, I found this House of the
King's built after the Moorish fashion,
and a man may justly praise the Coun∣trey;
in your entrance to it you must
pass through a Garden, where there
are several Conduits, in this Garden
you ascend five or six steps, and you
go to a kind of Summer-house stand∣ing
very high where you take the Air,
I found a very fine Chapel, and a
Lodging for all those who attended
me.


On 
Munday
 the ninteenth the King
gave me a particular Audience, after
Dinner I went abroad to take the Air
on Elephants, whose goings are very
uneasie and incommodious, I had ra∣ther
ride ten Leagues on Horse back
than one on these animals.


On the twenty third Mr. 
Constans

told me the King would give me the
divertisement of a combat of Elephants,


and entreated me to bring along with
me the Captains who had conducted
me to shew them the sport, who were
the Sieurs de 
Vaudricourt
 and 
Joy∣euse;

we went thither on Elephants,
and the Fight was carried on after
the same manner as that which I above
related.


The King sent for the Captains and
told them, he was very glad they were
the King of 
France
's first Captains
who came into his Kingdom, and he
wisht them as happy a return as their
arrival was. He gave each of them
a Scimitar, whose handle and guard
was of Gold, and the sheaths almost
covered with the same metal, a golden
Chain curiously wrought and very large,
a Vest of cloth of Gold with Gold
buttons; as Mr. de 
Vaudricourt
 was
the chief Captain, so his Present was
richer and better, the King gave him
notice to have a care of their Enemies
by the way, they answered that his
Majesty furnisht them with arms to de∣fend
themselves, and that they would
acquit themselves of their duty. These
Captains spake to him without light∣ing


off their Elephants; I saw very
well that under pretence of a combat
of Elephants, he was minded to make
these Presents in the sight of several
Europeans who were present, to give
a publick mark of the particular di∣stinction
he would make of the 
French

Nation: The King afterwards returned,
and I went to see an Elephant which
had been brought by the females who
are instructed to go into the woods
with a man or two to conduct them,
as far as twenty five or thirty Leagues
to seek wild Elephants, and when
they have found any, they so order it
as to draw them on to a place near
the Town designed to receive them;
'tis a great space dug in the earth,
and surrounded by a wall of Brick very
high, there is also a second inclosure
about fifteen foot high, through which
a man may easily pass, and a double
gate of the same height, which shuts
of it self by means of a pully, so that
when an Elephant is within, he can∣not
get out. The female Elephants
do first enter, the wild ones follow
them, and they are fast.



This same day Mr. 
Constans
 presen∣ted
the two Captains with several fine
wrought Japon works of Silver and
other Curiosities.


On Saturday the twenty fourth I
got on horseback to go see the wild
Elephants taken.


The King being come to the end
of this place which is enclosed as a∣bove
said, there entred a man who
went with a staff to attack the wild
Elephant, who at the same time left
the females, and pursued him, the man
continued this management, and thus
busied this wild Elephant, till the
females who were with him got out
of the place by the gate, which was
immediately shut after them, and the
Elephant seeing himself left alone im∣prisoned,
grew inraged; the fellow set
upon him again, and instead of flying
on that side which he was wont, he
ran out of the gate, and the Ele∣phant
followed him, and when he was
between the two gates he was shut in,
and being hot they threw a great deal
of water on him to refresh him, and
there were several Elephants brought


to him, who caressed him with their
trunks, to comfort him as it were;
they tyed his two hind legs, and the
gate was opened to him, he marched
five or six paces, and found four Ele∣phants
of War, and one to confront him,
two others who were fastned to his sides,
and one behind him to push him with
his head; they brought them in this
manner into a kind of Stable ground,
where there was a great stake fastned,
to which he was tyed, and two Ele∣phants
were placed on each side of him
to bear him company, and the others
are led away. When the wild Ele∣phants
have remained fifteen days,
in this manner, they know them who
were wont to feed them, and follow
them, and afterwards they become as
tractable as the others. The King
has a great many of these females
who do nothing else but decoy these
wild ones.


On 
Munday
 the twenty fifth I went
to see a Tyger fight with three Ele∣phants,
but the Tyger was not the
strongest, he received a blow with a
tooth that carried a way half his jaw,


although the Tyger was not wanting
in courage.


Tuesday
 the twenty sixth I had a
particular Audience, this being the
fourth time, and the King shewed me
the esteem he had for the French Na∣tion,
after several other discourses,
of which I have given the King an
account. At night I went to see a
Feast, which the 
Siamoises
 celebrate at
the beginning of their year, which is
attended with great lights. It's perfor∣med
in the Palace, in a great Court,
round about which there are several
boxes full of Lamps, and before these
boxes there are a great many perches
drove into the ground, along which
hang several horn Lanthorns prettily
painted, this Feast lasts eight days.


On 
Sunday
 the second of 
September,

Mr 
Constans
 sent me a Present, he did
the same also to the Abbat of 
Choisy,

and the Gentlemen which accompa∣nied
me; the Presents were Bracelets,

China
 Cabinets, night Gowns and Ja∣pon
works made of Silver Bezoarstones,
Rhinocero's horns, and other curiosities
of that Countrey.



On the tenth I went to see the great
hunting of Elephants, which is in this
following form: The King sent a
great number of female Elephants all
in a company together, and when they
have been several days in the wood,
and he is informed they have found
Elephants, he sends thirty or forty
thousand men, who make a great
ring in the place where the Elephants
are; they post themselves several foot
distance one from another, and each
company has a fire about three foot
high or thereabouts: there is also ano∣ther
ring of Elephants of War, distant
from one another about an hundred and
an hundred and fifty paces, and in those
places where the Elephants may more
easily pass thorough, the Elephants of
War are more numerous; in several
places there is Cannon which is fired
at the wild Elephants when they will
force a passage, for they are in great
fear of fire: every day this inclosure
or ring is lessoned and at length 'tis
very small, and the stres are also di∣minished.
These Elephants hearing a
noise about them, dare not fly, although


now and then one or two do escape,
for I was told that some days past
there were ten got away. When they
are to be taken they are made to en∣ter
into a place surrounded with stakes,
where there are some trees, through
which a man may easily pass, there is
also another ring of Elephants of War
and Souldiers, among which there are
men mounted on Elephants, who dex∣terously
throw cords at the Elephants
hind feet, who when they are fastned
are brought between two tame Ele∣phants,
besides which there is another
who tends on him behind, if need be
to push him forward, so he is obliged
to march, and when he is unruly, the
others strike him with their trunks;
they bring him into a kind of stable
open on all sides, where they are
fastned and managed as I have already
related: I saw ten taken, and I was
told there were a hundred and forty
in the ring; the King was there pre∣sent
and gave orders for what was ne∣cessary.
In this place I had the honour
to have a long conference with him,
and he prayed me to leave Mr. 
Fourbin,



the Leiutenant of my Ship with him,
which I agreed to, and presented him,
and at the same time the King gave him
a Semitar, whose Handle and Guard was
of Gold, and the Sheath studded with the
same, with a Justaucorp of embroide∣red
Satin with Gold Buttons. Then the
King presented me with a Golden Cup,
and gave me a Collation in a Grove,
where I had excellent Wine and Fruit.


The next morning being the eleventh
I returned to this game, being moun∣ted
on an Elephant, the King was there,
and sent two 
Mandarins
 to me, to de∣sire
me to come to him, he spake seve∣ral
things to me, and entreated me to
leave Mr. 
de la Mare
 the Engineer, who
came along with me behind me, to for∣tifie
some places in his Countrey. I told
him I did not doubt but the King my
Master would be content I should leave
him, seeing His Majesty's Interests were
as dear to him as his own; I thereup∣on
ordered Monsr. 
de la Mare,
 to re∣main
with the King, who gave to him
a Vest of Stuff of Gold. The King told
me, he would send a little Elephant to
the Duke of 
Burgundy,
 which he shewed


me, and having a while thought on
it, he said that if he should give one
onely to the Duke of 
Burgundy
 he fea∣red
lest the Duke of 
Anjou
 should take
it ill, and therefore he would send two,
and I designing to part the next mor∣ning
to go on board, I presented the
Gentlemen to him who were with me,
to take leave of his Majesty, the King
wisht them a good Voyage. The Bi∣shop
would have presented to him 
Mes∣sieurs,

the Abbat 
de Lionne,
 and 
le Va∣cher,

Missionaries, to take their leave
of him, but he told the Bishop, that
as to those two persons, they were of
his Family, and that he respected them
as his Children, and that they should
take their leave of him in his Castle:
afterwards the King retired, and I at∣tended
on him to the end of the Wood,
taking the way of 
Louvo,
 because the
King had a House in the Wood, where
he usually tarries whilst he is busied in
this Game of Elephants.


On 
Wednesday,
 the twelfth, the King
gave me Audience of Leave, the Bishop
was there, he was pleased to say he
was very well satisfied with me and my


Negotiation; he gave me a great gol∣den
Vessel which they call a Boss, and
this is one of the most honourable
marks of the King's Favour; he told
me he would not have the accustomed
Ceremonies about it, because there
might be something which would not
please me by reason of the Genufle∣xions
which the greatest of the King∣dom
are obliged to make on this oc∣casion.
There is no Stranger in his
Court, excepting the King of 
Camboye
's
Nephew, who has received the like
Mark of Honour, which signifies that
one is an 
Oyas,
 a Dignity in that Coun∣trey
comparable to a Duke in 
France;

there are several sorts of 
Oyas,
 which
are distinguished by their Bosses. This
Monarch had the goodness to tell me
several things in such an obliging man∣ner,
that I dare not relate them; and in
all my Voyage I received such great Ho∣nours,
that I should scarce be believed,
were they not sole due to the Character
His Majesty has been pleased to honour
me with: I received also a thousand
Civilities from his Ministers, and the
rest of his Court. 
Messieurs
 the Abbat


of 
Lionne,
 and 
le Vacher,
 took at the
same time their leaves of the King,
who having wisht them a good Voyage,
gave each of them a golden Crucifix,
the Foot of it being Silver. At the
end of the Audience, Monsr. 
Constans

carried me into a Parlor, surrounded
with Water-spouts which was in the
Palace, where I found a Table very
well spread, after the manner of the
Kingdom of 
Siam:
 The King had the
goodness to send me two or three
Dishes from His Table, for he dined
at the same time; about five of the
Clock I went into a gilt Chair, car∣ried
by ten Men, and the Gentlemen
who accompanied me rode on Horse∣back,
we entred into our Barks, and
were attended by a great many 
Manda∣rins,

the Streets were lined with Sol∣diers,
Elephants, and Moorish Cava∣liers.
'Twas the same also in the mor∣ning,
when I had my last Audience; all
the 
Mandarins
 that accompanied me to
my Barge, went into theirs, and came
with me; there were about an hundred
Barges, and I arrived the next mor∣ning,
being the thirteenth, at 
Siam,



about three in the morning. The King
of 
Siam
's Letter, and his Ambassadors
for 
France,
 were with me, in a very
stately Barge attended by several others.
The King made me several Presents,
amongst which was a crucifix, the bo∣dy
of which is Gold, a Cross of 
Tam∣bacq,

which is a metal more esteemed
than Gold in that Countrey, with seve∣ral
other Curiosities of the 
Indies;
 and
the Custome of these Countries being
to gratifie those who bring the Pre∣sents,
I gave to the Steers-men of the
King's Barges about eight or nine hun∣dred
Pistols. As to Monsr. 
Constans,
 I
took the Liberty to give him a piece of
Houshold-stuff, which I had brought
along with me from 
France,
 and to
Madam his Wife, several Presents, to
the value of an hundred and fifty Pistols;
the King also gave Presents to the va∣lue
of seven or eight hundred Pistols to
the Abbat 
de Choisy
 in 
China
 Cabinets,

Japon
 Works, and other Indian Curi∣osities.


On the fourteenth, at five of the
Clock at night, I parted from 
Siam,

accompanied by Mr. 
Constans;
 several



Mandarins,
 and a great many Barges,
and arrived at 
Bancoc
 the next morning,
the Forts by the way, and those of 
Ban∣coc,

saluted me with all their Artille∣ry;
I remained a day at 
Bancoc,
 be∣cause
the King had told me in an Au∣dience,
that being a Soldier, he desired
me I would view the Fortifications of
it; and to tell his Servants what it
wanted, and to pitch on a place where∣on
to build a Church; I drew a small
draught, and gave it to Monsr. 
Con∣stans.


On the sixteenth in the morning I
parted thence accompanied by 
Manda∣rins,

the Forts saluted me, and at four
of the Clock I arrived at the Bar of

Siam,
 in the Shalops belonging to the
King's Ships, on board of which I went
about seven of the Clock.


On the seventeenth the King of 
Si∣am
's
Frigat, in which were the Ambas∣sadors,
came and cast Anchor near my
Ship; I sent my Shalop, which brought
two of the Ambassadors, and I after∣wards
sent back the same Shalop, which
brought the other Ambassador, and
the King's Letter, which was written


on a Leaf of Gold, rowled up, and put
into a Gold Box; we saluted the Letter
with the firing of several pieces of Can∣non,
'twas laid on a Table, with a Ca∣nopy
over it, and when the 
Mandarins


ast near it, they reverenced it after
their manner, it being their custome to

oe the greatest Honours they are able
to the King's Letter. The next mor∣ning
this Ship left us, and went back
again up the River, and at the same
time appeared another Ship of the King
of 
Siam
's, who came and cast Anchor

ear us, in which was Monsr. 
Constans;


e came on board of me the next mor∣ning,
being the nineteenth, where he di∣
ed,
and afterwards he went to land in

y Shalop; I saluted him with twenty
pieces of Cannon, and we parted with

o small trouble, for we had begun a
strict Friendship, and treated one ano∣ther
with the greatest confidence; he is
a Person of great Sense and Merit. I
was astonisht to hear no News of Monsr.

de Vacher,
 a Missionary of the French
Company, and of my Secretary, who
were to have been on board before me,
having been informed that they parted


from the River of 
Siam
 on the sixteenth
with seven Gentlemen, who were to ac∣company
the King of 
Siam
's Ambassa∣dors,
and several of their Domesticks▪
this made me think they were lost, a

made me resolve not to tarry for the

for the Wind was favourable; b

Monsr. 
Constans
 desired me to have pa∣tience
one day, whilst he would sen

along the Coast for News of them.


The next morning, being the twen∣tieth,
part of these People came o

board, four of the Gentlemen belon∣ging
to the King of 
Siam
's Ambassa∣dors,
and most of their Domesticks ha∣ving
been unwilling to embark them∣selves
in a Boat they had gotten by the
way, because 'twas too shallow; they
told me, that the same day, being the
sixteenth, they came near our Vesse

at eleven at night, and thinking to ca

Anchor, they had not Rope enough i

their Boat, which they perceived i

seeing their Boat fall off from the Ves∣sel,
then there arose a great Wind▪
which made the waves arise, and the
Streams ran against them, which car∣ried
them fourty Leagues out at Sea,


with great danger of being cast away;
they told us they had left the others
about twenty five Leagues off, who were
thrown upon a muddy bank, so that
they are not to be expected so soon,
which made me resolve not to go away
before next morning. I believe I ought

 this place to speak of the Jesuits
which were embarkt with us at 
Brest,

and whom we left at 
Siam:
 They were

ather 
Fontenay, Tachart, Gerbillon, le∣
mte,
Bouvet,
 and another, Men of
Vertue and Learning, whom the King
had chosen to send to 
China,
 to make
Mathematical Observations; I think I

m bound in Justice to say of them,

at when we were arrived to the

ape of Good Hope, the Dutch Gover∣
our
was very kind to them, and gave

hem an House in the Garden belon∣ging
to the Company, very fitting to

ake their Observations in, where

hey carried all their Mathematical In∣
truments;
but as I remained but six or

even days in this place, they had not

me to make a great many: These Fa∣thers
have been very usefull to me in

ny Voyage to 
Siam,
 by their Piety,


their good Examples, and the pleasant∣ness
of their conversations; I had every∣day
near five or six Masses said, and

 had set apart a Chamber for that very
purpose. All the Festivals and S

days we had a Sermon, or a short E
hortation,
Father 
Tachart,
 one of the

catechised the whole Ship's Company
three times a Week, and the same 
∣ther
has done much good in the Ship

for discoursing familiarly with the Se

men and Souldiers there's not one 

them but performs his Devotions; 

composed all differences which ar

amongst them. These Fathers went 


Siam
 intending to embark themselves
on 
Portugal
 Vessels, which are to 

met with commonly at 
Macao,
 a

which return to 
China.
 They fou

here Monr. 
Constans,
 the King of 
Siam
 

Minister, who very much loves the J
∣suits,
and protects them, he has enter∣tained
them at 
Louvo,
 in one of the
King's Houses, and defrays all the

Charges himself.


In an Audience which the King gav

me, I told him I had brought with 

six Jesuits, who intended for 
China,
 to


make Mathematical Observations, and
that they had been chosen by the King
my Master, as the most capable in this
Science. He told me he would see them,
and was very glad they were reconci∣led
with the Bishop; he has spoke to
me several times on that Subject. Monsr.

Constans
 presented them to him four or
five days after, and by good hap for
whom there was then an Eclipse of the
Moon▪ The King bid them bring along
with them their Mathematical Instru∣ments
into a House where he was go∣ing
to lie, a League off of 
Louvo,
 where

 commonly is, when he takes the
pleasure of Hunting; the Fathers fai∣
ed
not to come there, and planted
themselves with their spectacles in a
Gallery, where the King came about
three of the Clock in the morning,
which was the time of the Eclipse.
They made him see in their Instrument
all the Effects of the Eclipse, which

id much please him, he shewed them
much respect, and told them he knew
Monr. 
Constans
 was their Friend, as well
as Father 
de la Chaize▪
 He gave them 

great Crucifix of Gold, and of 
Tam∣bacq,



and bid them to send it from
him to Father 
la Chaize;
 he gave ano∣ther
smaller to Father 
Tachart,
 telling
them he would see them another time

Seven or eight days before my depar∣ture,
Mr. 
Constans
 offered the Fathers
that if two of them would remain at

Siam
 the King would be very glad of
it, they answered they could not, being
ordered by the King of 
France
 to make
what haste they could to 
China;
 he an∣swered,
this being so, they must writ

to their General to send a dozen of
them as soon as he could to 
Siam,
 the
King having told him he would build
them Prospect houses, Churches and 

other Conveniencies: Father 
Fonten

made this known to me, I told hi

he could not do better than accept o

this proffer, seeing in the end thi

must turn to a great advantage; he
told me upon my encouragement, 

intended to send Father 
Tachart
 int


France
 on this occasion, which I ap∣proved
of. Father 
Tachart
 being a
man of great Wit, and who would un∣doubtedly
effect this business, Letter
not being sufficient to remove seven


objections which might be raised,
wherefore I brought him with me home.
This Father has moreover much assisted
me, as also the Gentlemen which ac∣companied
me, whom he taught during
our Voyage a considerable part of the
Mathematicks. I shall say nothing of
the great qualities of Mr. the Bishop of

Metellopolis,
 nor of the Progress of the
Missionaries in the East, seeing that ac∣cording
to their Custome, they will not
fail to give the publick a full relation
of what concerns Religion in those
Countreys. I should have great satis∣faction
to have met there with Mon∣sieur
the Bishop of 
Heliopolis;
 the King
of 
Siam
 told me one day what Joy
'twould have been to him, to have seen
an Ambassador in that Countrey from

France;
 but it did not please God to
give us that consolation, and we were
informed that he had ended in 
China
 his
laborious Pilgrimage.


But before we relate our Arrival at

Brest,
 I believe it will be convenient
to give an Account here of what I re∣marked


(during that small time I was
in the Kingdom) of the Manners, Cu∣stoms,
Government, Commerce and
Religion of these People.








Of the Government, State,
Manners, Religion and
Commerce of the King∣dom
of Siam, in the
neighbouring Countries,
and several other parti∣cularities.


EVery day the 
Mandarins,
 whose
place it is to do Justice, meet
together in a Hall, where they
hear Causes: This place is in
the King's Palace, where those that
have any request to make stand at the
door, till they be called, and then
they enter with their Petition in their
Hands.



Strangers, who have any complaint
concerning Traffick, offer it to the

Barcalon,
 who is the King's Chief Mi∣nister,
and determins all Affairs about
Commerce, and the occasions of Stran∣gers;
in his absence, his usual Deputy
does it, and in both their absences a
kind of Aldermen. There is an Offi∣cer
appointed to see after the Taxes,
and others for other matters. When
Affairs have been examined, an account
thereof is given to the Officers within
the Palace, who relate the same to the
King, sitting then on a high Throne,
all the 
Mandarins
 prostrate themselves
with their Faces on the Ground; and
the 
Barcalon,
 or others of the Chief

Oyas,
 acquaint the King with the Af∣fair,
and their Judgments thereupon,
which he confirms or alters according
to his Will, and this extends to the
chief businesses, but he oft causes mat∣ters
to be brought into the Palace, and
sends his pleasure in Writing.


The King is a most absolute Prince,
and a Man may say him to be the 
Sia∣moises

God; they dare not call him by
his Name. He punishes most severely


the smallest Crime, for his Subjects
must be governed in a strict manner;
he sometimes makes use of Souldiers of
his Guard to punish the guilty, when
their Crime is extraordinary, and suf∣ficiently
proved. Those who are com∣monly
employed in these sort of Exe∣cutions,
are an hundred and fifty Soul∣diers,
or thereabout, who have their
Armes painted from the Shoulder to
their Wrists; the common punishment
is thirty, forty, fifty or more stripes
on the Shoulders of the Criminal, ac∣cording
to the greatness of the Crime;
others are peckt into the head with a
sharp pointed Iron: as to Accomplices
in a fault worthy of Death, after the
Head has been cut off from a real Cri∣minal,
'tis tied about the Neck of the
Confederate, and is left exposed to the
Sun for three days and three nights,
which gives a most filthy stink to him
that carries it.


In this Kingdom the Law 
Talionis
 is
in great use, the worst punishment was,
not long ago, to condemn Malefactours
to the River, which is such another
kind of punishment as the Gallies, or


rather worse; but now they are punisht
with Death. The King minds building
more than any of his Predecessours, re∣pairing
the Walls of Towns, raising
up 
Pagodes,
 and adorning his Palace,
building Houses for Foreigners, and
Ships after the European Fashion; he
is very kind to Strangers, retaining se∣veral
of them in his Service, and desi∣rous
of more.


The Kings of 
Siam
 were not wont to
let themselves be seen as this does; they
lived always alone, but this present
King lives like others; but Monsr. 
Be∣rithe,

an Apostolick Vicar, made use
of a certain 
Brame,
 who being a kind
of Boufon, had great liberty of spea∣king
to this Monarch, by whose means
he gave the Prince to understand the
Power and Manner of the Government
of our great Monarch, and also the Cu∣stoms
of all the Kings in 
Europe;
 so
that he being a Man of Sense, as I al∣ready
observed, he thought fit to send
for Monsieur 
Berithe,
 and afterwards
several others: since which time he is
become very affable, and accessible to
Strangers. Those who administer Justice


are called according to their different
Offices, 
Oyas Obrat, Oyas Momrat, Oyas
Campeng, Oyas Ricchou, Oyas Shaynan,
Opran Olvan, Oeun, Omun.


Heretofore when the Kings would
not let themselves be seen, the mini∣sters
did what they pleased, but the
present King who wants not Judgment,
and is a great Politician, will be igno∣rant
of nothing; he has sixt to him
Mr. 
Constans
 of whom I have several
times spoken. He is a Greek by Na∣tion,
a person of great vivacity of spi∣rit,
and extraordinary prudence, he
can and does do all things under the
King's authority in the Kingdom, but
this Minister would never accept of
any great office which the King has
offered him several times. The 
Bar∣calon

who died about two years since,
and who by right of his place had the
management of all affairs of State, was
a person of great abilities, that ac∣quitted
himself well in his employments,
and was greatly beloved, he that suc∣ceeded
him was a 
Malais
 by nation,
which is a Countrey near to 
Siam,
 he
made great use of Mr. 
Bacon
 an English


man to bring the King into an ill opi∣nion
of Mr. 
Constans,
 and render him
suspected, but the King underst
od the
others malice, caused him to be cudgeled
to death, and dispossessed him of his
office; he that enjoys it at present
lives in good intelligence with Mr.

Constans.


As by the Laws introduced by the
Priests, who are called 
Talopoins,
 'tis not
allowable to kill, so Malefactors were
heretofore condemned to the chain, or
led into some Deserts to perish there
with hunger, whereas this present King
causes their heads to be struck off,
and throws them to Elephants.


The King has spies to know whether
matters of any importance are con∣cealed
from him, he most severely
chastises those, who abuse their autho∣rity.
Every strange Nation established
in the Kingdom of 
Siam
 has particular
Officers, and the King takes of all these
Nations persons which he makes gene∣ral
Officers throughout all his King∣dom.
There are many 
Chinoises
 in
his Countrey; there were heretofore
many Moors, but some years past he


discovered so many foul treacheries
amongst them, such frauds and enor∣mities,
that he has banish'd most of
them out of his Countrey.


The commerce of strange Merchants
was heretofore very considerable; but
since some years, the various revolu∣tions,
which have happened in 
China,
Japon
 and other parts of the Indies,
have discouraged all Trade. Yet 'tis
hoped, seeing all these disturbances
are quieted, Trade will flourish again;
and that the King of 
Siam
 by means
of his Minister will send his Ships to
take in the most pretious commodities
in all the Eastern Countries, and re∣duce
all things to their first state.


They make War after a different man∣ner
from most Nations, driving their
Enemies out of their places, without
doing them any farther harm than the
making them slaves; and if they bear
Arms, it seems rather they intend to
affright them by shooting on the ground
or up into the air, than to kill them,
and if they doe, 'tis rather out of ne∣cessity
than by their good-wills; but this
happens seldom, because all their Ene∣mies


follow the same method. There
are Companies and Regiments who are
detached from the rest during the night,
who go into the Enemies Villages, and
lead away all the Inhabitants captives,
as well Women as Children; the King
gives them Lands and Buffalo's to cul∣tivate
them, and when the King has
need he makes use of them. These
late years, the King has made War a∣gainst
the revolted 
Cambogions,
 assisted
by the 
Chinoises
 and 
Cochinnoises,
 where
he was forced to fight in earnest, and
there were several Souldiers killed on
both sides: He has had several Com∣manders
that are Europeans, who in∣struct
them to fight after our man∣ner.


Before this War there was a great
commerce between their States, and
that of 
Siam
 drew great advantages by
the great quantities of Gold, Musk,
Elephants teeth and other Merchandises
which came from 
Laos
 in exchange for
Linen and other Goods.


The King of 
Siam
 is still at wars
with the King of 
Pegu,
 he has several
Slaves of this Nation.



There are People of several Coun∣tries
in his Kingdom, the Moors were
in great abundance, as I already said,
but now several of them are fled into
the Kingdom of 
Colconde,
 who were in
the King's service, and have carried a∣long
with them above twenty thousand

Catis,
 each 
Catis
 being worth fifty
Crowns: The King of 
Siam
 wrote to the
King of 
Colconde
 to send him back those
Fugitives, or oblige them to pay the
Sum, but the King would not listen to
the proposal, which has put the King
of 
Siam
 on proclaiming a War against
him, and taking a Ship at the time
when I was at 
Siam
 belonging to him,
whose lading is valued at an hundred
thousand Crowns. There are six Frigats
commanded by English and French, who
cruise on those Coast.


Of late the Emperour of 
China
 has
given leave to all Strangers to come
and Negotiate in his Kingdom; this
permission is onely for five years, but
'tis hoped it will be continued, seeing
'tis of great advantage to his Coun∣trey.



The King of 
Siam
 has a great many

Malais
 in his Kingdom, they are Ma∣hometans,
but good Souldiers, yet their
Religion differs much from the Moors.
The 
Pegorans
 are as numerous in this
Countrey as the originary 
Siamoises.


There are also a great many 
Laoises,

especially towards the North. Here
are also eight or nine Families of Na∣tive

Portuguises,
 but of those which
are called 
Mesties
 above a thou∣sand,
that is to say, those who are
born of 
Portuguises
 and 
Siamoise
 wo∣men.


The Dutch have there onely one
Factory.


The English the same.


The French also.


The 
Cochinnoises
 are about an hundred
Families, most Christians.


Amongst the 
Tonquinoises
 there are
seven or eight Christian Families.


The 
Malaises
 are in great numbers,
who are most of them slaves, and who
consequently do not make a body.


The 
Macassars,
 and several of the
People of the Isle of 
Java
 are there
establish'd, as also the Moors; under


the Name of these last are comprehen∣ded

Turks, Persians, Moguls, Colcondoi∣ses

and those of 
Bengala.


The 
Armenians
 make a separate
body, they are fifteen or sixteen Fa∣milies
all Christians, the greatest part
of them are Horsemen of the King's
Guard.


As to the manners of the 
Siamoises,

they are a People very docible, which
proceeds rather from their nature,
which desires quiet, than any other
cause; and therefore the 
Talapoins,

who make profession of this apparent
vertue, forbid the killing of all sorts
of animals, yet when any others kill
Pullets or Ducks, they eat their flesh,
without troubling themselves who did
the murther, or wherefore they were
killed.


The 
Siamoises
 are generally chaste,
having but one Wife, but the rich Peo∣ple,
such as the 
Mandarins
 have Con∣cubines,
who remain shut up all their
lives. The people are trusty, and sel∣dom
steal, but 'tis not the same with
some of the 
Mandarins.



The 
Malaises
 who are very numerous
in this Kingdom are a very base People,
and great Thieves.


In this great Kingdom there are se∣veral

Pegovans,
 who have been taken in
War, they are a more stirring and vi∣gorous
sort of People, than the 
Sia∣moises;

the Women are given to li∣berty,
and their conversation is dan∣gerous.


The 
Laoises
 people the fourth part
of the Kingdom of 
Siam,
 and being
one half 
Chinoises,
 they partake of their
manners, their craft and inclinations to
shirk handsomely; their Women are
white and not ugly, very sociable and
consequently perilous. In the King∣dom
of 
Laos,
 a man that meets a wo∣man
to salute her with the accustomed
civility, kisses her publickly, and did
he do otherwise he would grievously
offend her.


The 
Siamoises
 as well Officers as

Mandarins,
 are generally rich, for they
spend hardly any thing, the King gi∣ving
them Servants, who are obliged
to maintain themselves at their own
cost, being as it were slaves, they are


under an obligation to serve them for
nothing half a year; and these Masters
having many of them, they make use
of one part whilst the other rest them∣selves,
but those who do not serve them,
pay them every year a sum of money;
their Victuals are cheap, it being onely
Rice, Fish, and little Flesh, and there's
great. plenty of this in the Countrey;
their Cloaths last them long, being
entire pieces of Stuff, which do not so
soon were out as our Apparel, and
cost very little. Most of the 
Siamoi∣ses

are Bricklayers, or Carpenters, and
there are very good workmen amongst
them, exactly imitating the curious
Works of 
Europe.
 As to Painting, they
are in a manner ignorant of the use of
it, there are Carved works in their

Pagodes,
 and their Tombs are well
polished, and very stately.


They colour finely with Lime, which
they soak in water which they draw
out of a Tree, found in the Forests,
which makes it so lasting, that it dures
an hundred or two hundred years, al∣though
exposed to the injury of the
weather.



Their Religion to speak properly,
is onely a parcel of Fabulous Tales,
which serve onely to bring respect and
profit to the 
Talapoins;
 who recom∣mend
not so much any Vertue to them,
as that of giving them Money: They
have Laws, which they strictly observe,
especially outwardly. Their end in all
their good works is the hope of a hap∣py
Transmigration after their death,
into the body of a rich Man, of a King,
or great Lord, or of a tame animal, as
Cows or Sheep, for these People are
so far 
Pythagoreans;
 they for this rea∣son
do much esteem these Animals, and
dare not, as I have noted, kill any of
them, as knowing not but they may
kill their Father or Mother, or some
other of their Relations. They be∣lieve
a Hell, where great enormities
are severely punished, onely for a time;
as also a Paradise, wherein men of ver∣tue
are rewarded, where having become
Angels for some time, they afterwards
return into the Body of some man or
other animal.


The 
Talapoins
 chief business is, to
read, sleep, eat, sing and beg; they


go every morning to the Houses or
Barges of persons they know, and stand
there for a while with great reserved∣ness,
holding their Fan so that they
cover half their Faces; if they see any
one disposed to give them any thing,
they tarry till they have received it;
they eat whatsoever is given them,
whether Pullets or any other flesh, but
they never drink Wine, at least before
people; they perform no office nor
prayers to any Divinity. The 
Siamoi∣

believe there have been three great

alapoins,
 who by their most sublime

erlts in several thousand Transmigra∣tions
have become Gods, and having
been so, have moreover acquired such
great merits, that they have been
wholly annihilated; which is the term
of the greatest merit, and the greatest
ecompence attainable, being no longer
fired by their frequent changes of
bodies: The last of these three 
Tala∣eins

is the greatest God called 
Na∣
don,

because he has been in five thou∣sand
bodies; in one of these Trans∣
igrations,
of a 
Talapoin
 he became 

Cow, his Brother would have killed


him several times; but there needs a
great book to describe the miracles,
which they say, Nature, and not God
wrought for his preservation. In short,
this Brother was thrown into Hell
for his great sins, where 
Nacodon

caused him to be crucified; and
for this foolish reason they abominate
the Image of Christ on the Cross, say∣ing
we adore the image of this Bro∣ther
of their God, who was crucified
for his Crimes.


This 
Nacodon
 being annihilated, they
have no God at present, yet his La

remains, but onely among the 
Talapoine

who affirm that after some years, the

will be an Angel who will become 


Talapoin,
 and afterwards an absolut

Divinity, who by his great merits may
come to be annihilated. These are
the principles of their Creed; for 

not to be imagined they adore to
Idols, which are in their 
Pagodes
 

Divinities, but honour them onely 

men of great deserts, whose Souls 

at present in some King, Cow or 
Ta∣lapoin.

And herein consists their Re∣ligion,
which to speak properly at


knowledges no God. Vice say they,
carries with it its own punishment,
making the Soul pass into the body
of some vile Fellow, or Hog, or Crow,
or Tyger, or such like animal. They
admit of Angels, which they believe
to have been the souls of just men and
good 
Talapoins;
 as to Demons, they
say, they have been the souls of wicked
persons.


The 
Talapoins
 are much reverenced
by all the people, and even by the
King himself; they cast not themselves
on the ground when they speak to him,
as the greatest in the Kingdom do,
and the King and persons of highest
Quality salute them first: When these

Talapoins
 thank any one, they put their
hand to their forehead, and as to the
common people they salute them not
as all: They are Apparelled like other

Siamoises;
 excepting that their Sash

 yellow, their Legs and Feet naked,
they wear no Hats, they carry over
their heads a Fan, made of a large
Palm leaf, to keep them from the Sun
which is very hot; they make but one
meal a day, to wit in the morning,


and they eat at night perhaps some
few Figs, or other Fruits; they may
leave when they will their Profession
and marry, having no other engage∣ment
on them but onely to wear a
yellow Sash, and when they leave it,
they are at liberty; and this makes them
so numerous, that they are almost one
third of the Kingdom. That which
they sing in the 
Pagodes
 are some fa∣bulous
stories, larded with now and
then a fine sentence; those which they
sing during the Funerals of the dead
are, 
We must all die, We are all mortal▪

The dead bodies are burnt, musical
instruments playing all the while

these Funerals are very costly, and after
the bodies are burnt of those that are
dead, their ashes are put under great
Pyramids, all gilded with Gold, raised
about their 
Pagodes.
 The 
Talapoines

practise a kind of Confession; for the
Novices go at Sun rising to prostrate
themselves, or sit on their Heels, mum∣bling
some few words, after which
the old 
Talapoin
 lifts up his hand on
the side of his Cheek, and gives him
a kind of Benediction; which done, the


Novice retires. When they preach,
they exhort the People to be charita∣ble
to them, and suppose themselves
very able Fellows, when they can cite
some passages out of their ancient
Books, written in the 
Baly
 Language,
which is like the Latin amongst us; for
this Language is fine and emphatical,
having its Conjugations like the La∣tin.


When the 
Siamoises
 intend to marry,
the Man's Kindred go first to found the
Maid's Kindreds Inclination, and when
they have agreed on the business, the
Man's Parents present seven Boxes of

Betel
 and 
Arect
 to the Maid's Relati∣ons,
and though they accept of them,
and they are already esteemed as mar∣ried,
yet may be broke off.


Some days after the Man's Relations
present him, and he himself offers more
boxes than before, and then he re∣mains
in the House of his Father-in-law,
and this onely to see the Maid, and to
accustome themselves to one another,
which lasts for two Months; after this
all the Parents meet, when they put in∣to
a Purse, one a Ring, and another


Bracelets, and another Money; there
are others who lay pieces of Stuff o

the Table: In fine, the most ancient
of the Company takes a lighted Tores
and carries it seven times round these
Presents, whilest all the Assemble
shouts, wishing it a happy Marriage
the Spouse a long Life, and a perfect
Health; they afterwards eat and drin

together, and so the Marriage is finis

As to the Portion, 'tis as in 
France

excepting that the young Man's Relati∣ons
carry his Money to the Maid's Rela∣tions;
but all this turns to the same
for the Maid's portion is laid apart
and the whole is given to the new mar∣ried
Couple.


If the Husband puts away his Wife
without any form of Justice, he lose
the Money that has been given him; 

he repudiates her by the Judge's Sen∣tence,
who never refuses it, the Wo∣man's
Relations give him her portion; 

there be any Children, the Boy follow

the Mother, and the Girl the Father
if there be two Boys, and two Girls
one Boy and one Girl live with the Fa∣ther,
and one of each with the Mother▪



As to strong places in the Kingdom,
there's 
Bancock,
 which is about two
Leagues from the Kingdom of 
Siam,

where there are two Forts, as I already
mentioned. There is a Capital City
called 
Juthia,
 otherwise 
Siam,
 which is
newly fortified by an enclosure of brick
Walls. 
Corsuma,
 a fronteer Town ly∣ing
near the Kingdom of 
Camboye
 is

t a weak place, and so is 
Tanaserin

on the side of 
Malabar,
 and so are in∣deed
most of his Places.


As to their Souldiers, 'twas not the
Custome to pay them; but this present
King having understood that the Kings
of 
Europe
 payed their Men, intended
to have done the like; but being infor∣med
by his Treasurers what an immense

min 'twould cost him, by reason of
the multitude of his Souldiers, he chan∣ged
this pay into Rice, which he distri∣cted
to them, and they were there∣with
all well contented; for hereto∣fore
every Souldier was bound to fur∣ther
himself with Rice at his own cost.


As to their Boats and Vessels their

arges of State are the finest in the
World, (being made of one piece of


Timber,) and which are of a prodigi∣ous
length, some of them holding near
an hundred and fourscore Rowers; the
two ends are high raised, all is gift
with Gold, and neatly carved, and 

the midst of them there is a kind of
Throne, built like a Pyramid.


Heretofore they had onely Vessel
built like those of 
China,
 some of which
they use still to go into 
Japon, China

and 
Tunquin,
 but the King has cause
several to be built after the Europea

fashion, and has bought some of the
English. There are about fifty Gallies
to guard the River and Coasts; h

Gallies are not like ours, there being
but one Man to an Oar, and they are
about forty, or fifty at most, on each
The King makes use of Moors, 
China∣ses

and 
Malabars
 for his Seamen. The
Commanders of his Ships are either
English, or French, by reason of the

the Nations unskilfulness.


He sends every five or six years Ves∣sels
to 
China,
 of which there are 

a thousand to fifteen hundred Tun, la∣den
with Cloth, Coral, and divers o∣ther
Commodities, from the Coasts of



Coromandel
 and 
Suratte,
 as Salt-petre,
Tin and Silver; he draws thence raw
Silks, Satins, Tea, Musk, Rubarb,
Purcelins, Varnisht Works, 
China
-wood,
Gold, Rubies. They make
use of several Roots in Physick, which
turns much to their advantage:


The King sends to 
Japon
 two or
three small Vessels, laden with Mer∣chandise,
there being no need of sen∣ding
Money, such as Hides of all sorts,
which are good Commodities there,
for which they sometimes receive
Wedges of Gold and Silver, Copper,
and all sorts of Goldsmiths Work, as
also Tea, Cabinets, and other things,
He sends sometimes two or three to

Tonquin,
 of three hundred Tun at far∣thest,
with Cloth, Coral, Tin, Ivery,
Pepper, Salt-petre, and other Commo∣dities
of the 
Indies,
 for which he has
Musk, raw Silks, varnisht Wood, wedges
of Gold. To 
Macao
 the King sends
a Ship, for the most part laden with
the same Merchandises as to 
China.
 One
may send there also to good advantage,
Fans of Gold, Silver, Silks and Arms,
for which you receive the same Mer∣chandises


as at 
China,
 but not at the
same rate.


At 
Laos
 the usual Trade is carries
on as well by land as by water, some∣time
Flat Boats go there, in which are
sent Cloth and Linen of 
Suratte,
 and
the returns are Rubies, Musk, Gum,
Elephants Teeth, Rhinoceros Horns,
Buffalos Skins, and here is great prof

in this Trade, because there's no ris

to run.


To 
Camboye
 the King sends small
Barks with Cloth, 
Suratte
 Linen, and
Kitchin Utensile which come from 
Chi∣na,

for which he has brought him Ele∣phants
Teeth, Benjamin, three fort

of Gums, Buffalo's Skins, Nests o

Birds for 
China,
 of which I shall speak
hereafter.


They sometimes send to 
Cochinchim

but seldom; for this People is untrac∣table,
being most of them unfaithfull
which hinders Commerce; they can
when they go, Silver of 
Japon,
 to great
Profit, yellow Wax, Rice, Lead, Salt-petre,
red and black
Cloth, white li∣nen,
Vermilion and Quick-silver.


For which they have raw
Silk, Sugar


candied, Birds Nests, which are made
like those of Swallows, found on Rocks
by the Sea-side, they are a good Com∣modity
for 
China,
 and several other
places; for these Nests being well
washed and dried, they become as hard
as horn, and they are put into Broths;
they are of admirable virtue to the
sick and languishing persons, and to
those who are troubled with pains in
their Stomach, I have brought some of
them into 
France.


When there's no Vessel to be had at

Fret,
 they send one to 
Suratte,
 la∣den
with Copper, Tin, Salt-petre,
Elephants Teeth, 
Japon
 Wood, and
several other Merchandises which come
from other parts of 
India,
 and the re∣turns
are Linen-cloth, and other Eu∣ropean
Commodities, when there comes
none from 
Siam.


You may also trade to the Coasts of

Coromandel, Malabar
 and 
Bengala,
 the
Commodities are Elephants, Tin, Salt-petre,
Copper, Lead; and the returns
are Linen of all kinds.


There is seldom any trade to 
Borneo;

this is an Isle near that of 
Java,
 where


the returns are Pepper, Dragons bloud,
white Camphire, yellow Wax, Gold,
Pearl, Diamonds, the best in the World.


The Prince that possesses this Island
is not willing to permit a Trade, fea∣ring
always some surprise, and will suf∣fer
no European to settle in his Coun∣tries.
There have been some French
Merchants there, for he trusts them ra∣ther
than any other Nation.


There is also a Trade driven to 
Ti∣mor,

an Isle near the 
Molucques,
 whence
is drawn yellow and white Wax, Gold,
Slaves, 
&c.
 and thither is sent Linen of

Suratte,
 Lead, Elephants Teeth Pow∣der,
strong Waters, some sort of Arms,
red and black Cloth, and Silver. The
People here are peaceable, and negotiate
fairly. Here are a great many 
Portugueses.


As to the Commodities of 
Siam,
 there
is onely Tin, Lead, Ivory, Skins of
wild Beasts and Elephants; there will
be store of Pepper in time, that is to
say, the next Year, 
L'arrek,
 Iron, good
quantity of Rice, but you may find
here Commodities from all the places
before mentioned, and very cheap.
Here are brought pieces of English


Cloth, and Searges, Coral and Amber,
Cloth from the Coasts of 
Coromandel

and 
Suratte,
 Money in Piastres which
are truckt; but as I now said, most
Merchants have left trading here since
the King would turn Merchant, there
being brought few Goods, for the Ships
that were wont to come here, came not
the last year; so that here's little to
be found, all being in the King and his
Ministers Hands, who sell for what
they please.


The Kingdom of 
Siam
 is near three
hundred Leagues Long, without recko∣ning
the Tributary Kingdoms, to wit,

Camboges, Gehor, Patavi, Queda, &c.

It's bounded northward by the King∣dom
of 
Pegu,
 and by the Sea of 
Ganges;

on the side of the West, and from the
South by the little Strait of 
Malaca,

which was taken from the King of 
Si∣am

by the 
Portugueses,
 who have been
Masters of it near sixty years; the 
Hol∣landers

have taken it from them, and
are the present Masters of it; on the
East it's bounded by the Sea, and by
the Mountains which divide it from

Camboges
 and 
Laos.



The situation of this Kingdom is ad∣vantageous,
by reason of the great ex∣tent
of its Coasts, lying, as it were,
between two Seas, which open the pas∣sage
to so many vast Regions; its Coasts
are five hundred Leagues round, and
are every where accessible, from 
Japon,
China,
 the 
Philippin
 Islands, 
Tonquin▪
Cochinchine, Siampa, Camboge, Java,
Colconde, Bengala,
 and from all the
Coasts of 
Coromandel, Persia, Suratte,
Arabia
 and 
Europe;
 and therefore the
Countrey is capable of a great Com∣merce,
would the King permit all peo∣ple
to come and trade there as hereto∣fore.


The Kingdom is divided into eleven
Provinces, to wit, that of 
Siam, Tana∣serin,
Josalam, Reda, Pra, Jor, Paam,
Parana, Ligor
 and 
Siama.
 These Pro∣vinces
had heretofore the Quality of
Kingdoms, but are all now under the
sole power of the King of 
Siam,
 who
sets Governours over them.


There are some which may retain
the Name of Principalities, but the
Governours depend on the King, and
pay him Tribute. 
Siam
 is the princi∣pal


Province of this Kingdom, the Ca∣pital
City is situated fourteen degrees
and an half of latitude northward, on
the side of a great and stately River,
and Vessels laden come up to the City,
which lies above forty Leagues distant
from the Sea, and reaches above two
hundred Leagues up the Countrey, and

 this means it leads into part of the
Provinces, which I have above menti∣oned.
This River abounds with Fish,
and its sides are well peopled, although
they lie under water one part of the
Year. The Earth is indifferently fruit∣full,
but ill drest, the inundation pro∣ceeds
from great Rains, which fall for
three or four Months together, which
makes their Rice grow apace, so that
the longer the inundation lasts, the
more Rice they gather; and so far are
they from complaining, that their grea∣test
fear is of dry weather. There are
several lands lie untilled, for want of
Inhabitants, which has happened by
the preceding Wars, and they being
enemies to labour, they love onely
those things that are easie; so that
those Plains and Forests which are to


be seen on the Mountains serve for a
retreat to Elephants, Tygers, and wild
Cows, Deer, and Rhinocero's, and o∣ther
Animals, which are here in great
quantities.


As to Plants and Fruits, there are se∣veral
in the Countrey, but which are
not of great use, and which cannot be
easily brought over, by reason of the
length of the way. There are no Birds
but what we have in 
Europe,
 excepting
one like a Black-bird, which counter∣feits
the laughing of a Man, his singing
and whistling; the Fruits the most estee∣med
are Durions, they have a very
strong scent, which does not agree with
every body, but as to their taste 'tis
excellent. This fruit is very hot and
dangerous to ones health, if a Man eats
much of it. There is a great Nut,
about which is a kind of Cream shut in
a rine, which my Palate could never
approve of.


Mango is in this Countrey in prodi∣gious
quantities, and this is the best
Fruit in the 
Indies,
 of an exquisite taste,
no ways incommoding, unless a Man
eats too much of them, then indeed


they may cause a Fever; it's like an Al∣mond,
but as big as a large Pear.


The Mangoustan is a Fruit like a
green Nut, which has within it a white
Fruit, of a sharp and pleasant taste,
like that of a Peach or Plum, it's very
cold, and yet stringent.


The Jacques is a great Fruit which
is very good, but hot, and causes Fluxes
in the Bowels when one eats of it with
excess.


The Nana is like the Durion, that is
to say, in respect of its Skin, it has at
its end a crown of leaves, like the Ar∣tichoke;
its meat is very good, tasting
like a Peach and Apricock together;
it's very hot and strong, which makes
it commonly eaten soakt in Wine.


The Figs are a sweet Fruit of a kind
nature, yet somewhat phlegmatick,
there are of them all the year long.


The Ate is a very good sweet Fruit,
and does no hurt; there are who esteem
it more than all the Fruits in the 
Indies.

There are Oranges of all kinds, which
are very good.


The Pataie is a very good Fruit, but
the Tree which bears it lives onely two
years.



The Penplemouse is a wholesome
Fruit which is like the Orange, but
of a sharper taste. There are several
other Fruits which are not so good.
They began some years past to sow
Corn in the high Countries, near the
Mountains, which comes up well, and
is very good.


As also Vines which have been several
times planted, but to little purpose,
being eaten up to the roots, by a sort
of Ants.


There are a great many Sugar Canes
which yield abundance, as also To∣bacco,
which the 
Siamoises
 eat with

Arrek
 and 
Lime.


As to the 
Arrek
 the 
Siamoises
 esteem
this Fruit more than any other, for
this is their common food; there is
such a great quantity of it, that the
Markets are full of it; and a 
Siamoise

would think himself guilty of a great
undecency, should he speak to any one
without having his mouth full of 
Arrek
Betel,
 or Tobacco.


There is no City in the East, where
is seen more different Nations, than
in the Capital Town of 
Siam,
 and


where so many different Tongues are
spoken; it is two Leagues round, and
half a League long, well peopled, al∣though
so much under water, that it
resembles rather an Island; there are
none but English, French, Moors and

Chinoises
 who dwell in the Town, all the
other Nations being lodged round about
it in Camps, each Nation by them∣selves,
who, should they come all of
them into one body, would take
up as much room as the Town does;
but the reasons I before mentioned
hinder most strange Nations to come
and bring any thing with them.


The people are obliged to serve
the King four months in the year, and
longer if he needs them; he gives
them no pay, they being obliged to
keep themselves; and therefore the
Women work to maintain their Hus∣bands.


As to the Officers, from the greatest
Lords of the Court, to the meanest of
the Kingdom, the King onely allows
them some small gratifications, being
as much slaves as the rest, and this
saves a great deal of money. As to


far distant Provinces whose Inhabitants
do not actually serve, each singular
person pays him a Tribute. I arrived
at a time when the Countrey was wholly
under water, the Town seemed the
more pleasant for it; the Streets are
very long, large and streight, there
are on both hands Houses built on
Piles, and Trees planted round about
them, which makes a fine sight, and
you cannot go to them but in a Boat;
you would think you see at one look
a City, a Sea and a vast Forest, where
are several 
Pagodes,
 which are their
Churches, most of which are gilded;
about these 
Pagodes
 there are places
like Church-Yards, planted with Trees,
which are for the most part Fruit-Trees,
the Houses of the 
Talapoins

are the biggest and finest, and are very
numerous.


This Countrey is wholsomer than
any of the Indies; the 
Siamoises
 are
commonly well shap'd, although all of
them have tanned Countenances, they
are well sized, their Hair black, which
they wear short by reason of the heat,
they Bathe often, which contributes to


the preservation of their health; the
Europeans who dwell there do the
same to avoid sickness: They go a∣bout
all their business in Barges, du∣ring
the Inundations, which lasts six
or seven months together.


The King rises in the morning, and
holds a great Council about ten of the
Clock, wherein all affairs are treated
of, which being ended his Physicians
assemble to know the state of his health,
and he afterwards goes to Dinner; he
makes but one real Meal a day, and after
Dinner he withdraws into his Apart∣ment,
where he sleeps two or three
hours, and 'tis not known about what
he imploys himself the rest of the time,
it not being permitted his Officers to
enter into his Chamber. About ten
at night he holds another privy Coun∣cil,
where there are seven or eight

Mandarins
 of those which are most in
his favour; which Council lasts till
mid night: Afterwards he has Histories
or Verses made after their manner
read to him, to divert him, and com∣monly
after this Council, Mr. 
Constans

tarries with him alone, to whom he


opens his whole mind; the King being
sensible of his vast parts, his Conver∣sation
pleases him, and he seldom can
get away till three of the clock in the
morning; and this is the manner of
the King's living. At certain times he
takes pleasure in hunting, as I already
observed; he is always well drest: He
has no other Children, but a Daughter,
who is called the Princess Queen, of
twenty seven or twenty eight years of
age, the King greatly loves her; I was
told she was a handsome woman, but
she has never been seen by any men,
she eats in the same place and at the
same time her Father does, but at a
Table apart, and she is served by
Women, who are always prostrate in
her presence.


This Princess has her Court con∣sisting
of 
Mandarins
 Ladies, who see
her every day; and she holds a Council
with her Women about her own affairs;
she distributes Justice to those belong∣ing
to her, and the King having given
her Provinces, she maintains her Court
with the Revenue. It has happened
that when her Women have been pro∣ved


guilty of great slanders, or revea∣
ing
Secrets of great importance, she

 made their mouths be sowed up.


Before the death of the Queen her
Mother, she was as 'tis said inclinable
to grèat severities; she goes sometimes
a Hunting with the King, but 'tis in
a curious Chair placed on an Elephant,
and where though she is not seen, yet
she beholds all that passes. There are
Horsemen who march before her to
clear the way, and if there be any
one in the road that cannot soon get
out, he prostrates himself on the ground
on his face. She is all day shut up with
her Women, diverting her self with no
work, her dress is plain and light,
her Legs bare, she has light Pumps on
her feet, always bare headed, and wears
her Hair not passing four or five Fingers
long: She is a great lover of sweet
scents, anointing her Head with oil;
for in those Countries their Hair must
look shining, to be fine; she Bathes
every day, which is the custome of all
Indians, as well men as women: I
have learnt all this of Madam 
Constans,

who oft makes her Court to her. All


the Women which are in her Chamber
are always prostrate with their faces 

the ground in a rank; the ancientest are
nearest her, and they have the liberty
to look on the Princess, which 

have not in reference to the King, be
they of what quality they will; for as
long as they are in his presence, they
lye prostrate on the ground, even when
they speak to him.


The King has two Brothers. The
King's Brethren here are next Heirs of
the Crown, to the Exclusion of his
Children. When he goes out to Hunt
or walk, notice is given to all Euro∣peans
not to be in the way, unless they
will lye prostrate on the ground. A
while before he goes out of his Palace
you hear the Trumpets sound and
Drums beat, who march before the
King; at this noise the Souldiers who
stand in a row, prostrate themselves,
their foreheads to the ground, with
their Muskets under them; they are
in this posture as long as the King
can see them on his Elephant, where
he is placed in a close gilt Chair; the
Horse-Guard which attends him, which


consists of Moors is about forty, all
the King's Houshold are on foot, some
behind and some on one side, holding
their hands closed, and thus follow
him.


There are some of the principal

Mandarins
 who follow him on Ele∣phants,
ten or twelve Officers who car∣ry
Umbrellas about the King, and
there are onely those who do not pro∣strate
themselves, for at the same mo∣ment
that the King stops, all the other
fall down on their faces, and even those
that are on Elephants.


As to the manner which the King
of 
Siam
 observes in the reception of
Ambassadors, as those of 
Tonquin, Co∣chinchine,
Colconda, Malais, Java,
 and
other Kingdoms; he receives them in
a great Hall covered with Tapestry,
the chief men of the Kingdom being
in another Hall which stands lower,
and the Officers of lesser quality in
another, lower than the former, all of
them prostrate on Tapestry in expecta∣tion
of the King's appearance at a
window which is over against them;
the Hall wherein the Ambassadors


must be is raised about ten or twelve
feet, and distant from this Hall thirty
feet; 'tis known the King is upon ap∣pearing
by the noise of Trumpets,
Drums and other Instruments: The
Ambassadors are behind a wall which
encloses this Room in expectation of
the King's coming, and the Minister's
orders, which the King sends by
one of the Officers of his Chamber,
according to the quality of the Am∣bassadors;
after the Ministers have the
King's command, the door of the Hall
is opened, and then the Ambassadors
appear with their Interpreters, and
the Officer of the King's Chamber,
who serves for a Master of Ceremonies,
and precedes them on his Knees, his
hands closed; the Ambassador with his
Interpreters follows him in the same
posture, with great modesty, till he is
come one half of the way where he is
to go, and then bows himself three
times, and so continues going to the
nearest corner of the Halls where the
Guards are, and then he begins to
bow again; there is a Table between
the King and the Ambassador, about


eight foot distant, where lye the Pre∣sents,
which the Ambassador brings
the King, and between this Table and
the Ambassador's there is a 
Mandarin

who receives the King's words: in this
Hall are the King's Ministers, distant
from the Ambassadors about three
paces, and the Captain of the people,
whence the Ambassador is, between him
and the Ministers; the King begins to
speake first, and not the Ambassador,
ordering his Ministers to enquire of
the Ambassador, when he parted from
the Presence of his Master, whether
the King and all the Royal Family be
in health, to which the Ambassador
answers what's fitting, by his Interpre∣ter,
the Interpreter tells it the Cap∣tain
of the Nation (as they call it)
of which the Ambassador is, the Cap∣tain
to the 
Barcalon,
 and the 
Barcalon

to the King. After this the King
offers some questions about two or
three Points concerning the Ambassa∣dor;
and afterwards the King orders
the next Officer to the Table to give

Betel
 to the Ambassador, which is the
sign to present him a Vest; and im∣mediately


the King retires with the
noise of Drums and Trumpets, and
other Instruments. The Ambassador's
first Audience passes between him and
the Minister, who examines the Letter,
and the Presents of the Prince who
has sent them: The Ambassador does
not present the Letter to the King,
but to the Minister, after some days
of Council held on this subject.


When they be Ambassadors of In∣dependant
Kings, as of the Countries
of 
Persia,
 the Great 
Mogol,
 the Em∣perour
of 
China
 or 
Japon,
 they are re∣ceived
in this following manner.


The Grandees of the first and second
rank go to the foot of the window
where the King is, to prostrate them∣selves
according to their qualities on
Tapestry, when those of the third,
fourth and fifth rank, are in a lower
Hall, and expect the King's coming,
who appears at a window which jets
out of a wall, and is raised ten foot;
the Ambassadors are in a place out
of the Palace, expecting the Master
of the Ceremonies, who comes and
receives them, and there are the same


Ceremonies used which I have already
mentioned. The Ambassador entring
into the Palace, puts his hand upon
his head, marches through two Halls
to the Stairs, which are over against
the window where the King is, and
when he is there, he claps one knee
to the ground, and then immediately
a door is opened that he may appear
before the King, and the same Cere∣monies
are practised which I have al∣ready
denoted. There is a Golden
Platter on the Table, wherein lyes the
letter translated and open, having
been received by the Ministers some
days before in a Hall appointed for
that purpose. When the Ambassador
is in his place the Minister's Deputy
takes the Letter, and reads it aloud;
which done, the King asks the Am∣bassador
some questions by his Minister,
his Minister by the Captain of the
Nation, and the Captain by the In∣terpreter,
as I have already observed.


Having learnt this manner of recei∣ving
Ambassadors, which did not seem
agreeable to the greatness of the Mo∣narch
by whom I was sent, I desired


two 
Mandarins
 who attended me by
the King's order, to inform him that
I entreated him I might have the same
reception which Ambassadors are wont
to have in 
France,
 which was granted
me in the manner I related.






Departure from the Road of Siam.


Having given some account of the
Religion, Manners, Customes and Si∣tuation
of the Kingdom of 
Siam,
 

come now to relate my departure
which was on the twenty second of

December,
 1685.


We hoisted Sail at three of the mor∣ning
with a good Northern wind, which
continued all along the Coasts of 
Cam∣boge,

which is a Kingdom adjoyning
to that of 
Siam,
 and 
Cochinchine,
 The
People of these two Kingdoms have
the same belief, and live after the same
manner, There past nothing remark∣able
to the Strait of 
Banca,
 where I
ran on ground, on the side of an Isle
called 
Lucapara,
 on a Muddy bank
where there were but three fathoms of


water, and our Vessel required above
sixteen; this did not much disturb me,
though it did much the Ships Crew,
whom I sent to sound about the Ves∣sel,
I caused a small Anchor to be
brought, to which there was a Cable,
and we got off this bank in less than
five hours, and though I had a good
Dutch Pilot, yet I caused this Strait
to be often souded; I continued my
course and arrived at 
Bantam
 the
eleventh of 
January,
 1686. As soon
as I had cast Anchor there, I sent an
Officer of my Ship to Complement the
Governour, and to have fresh provi∣sions.
He sent me for a Present six
Oxen, Fruits and Herbs, and I re∣mained
in this Road but thirty hours.
We weighed Anchor on the twelfth
at night, but the calm overtook us,
which obliged us to cast Anchor.


On the thirteenth I weighed Anchor,
and we had all that day calms and con∣tray
winds, but at night there arose
a small wind, which made us double
the point of 
Bartam,
 and pass the
Strait of 
Sonda
 in less than eight hours:
I was obliged to land at the Isle of



Prince,
 which is at the mouth of the
Strait; in expectation of the 
Mali

Frigat, which could not follow us, but
at length joyned us.


On the fourteenth I held on my course
directly for the Cape of Good Hope,
with a favorable North wind, and North
North-East. The twenty third at break
of day having made about an hundred
and fifty Leagues we saw the Isles of
Holy Cross, which surprised us, be∣cause
the evening before I caused the
Pilots point to be showed me, who
told me to be at farthest, but fifteen
Leagues of Latitude Southward, and
twenty of Longitude.


This Island lyes very low, and had
it been three or four hours in the night,
we had certainly run on ground, but
it pleased God to preserve us. We
attributed this error to the Tides which
ran against us; we past this Isle quick∣ly,
the wind blowing hard, and con∣tinued
our course. The Sea is full
of Fish in these parts, and there are a
great many Birds, the weather was fair,
and we every day made thirty, forty,
fifty Leagues; we were diverted by


pleasant game we saw carried on by
the 
Albucorps
 and 
Bonnitres,
 and a small
Fish called a flying-fish, who when he
sees himself pursued, gets out of the
water, and flyes as long as his wings

ie moist, which may be as far per∣haps
as the flight of wild Ducks;
but there is a Bird which carries a great
feather in its Tail, longer than the
others by half a foot, and which has
the form and almost the colour of a
Straw; he is always in the air, and
when he sees this flying-fish leave
the water, he lets himself fall down
upon it, as a bird of prey on his game,
and some times they go deep into the
water after it; so that this slying-fish
seldom fails being taken.


On the fifteenth of 
February,
 we
found our selves not far from the Isle
of 
Maurice,
 where we met with a
blast of wind that lasted us three days;
the Sea was extreme rough, and gave
us a great deal of trouble; the waves
passing oft over our Ship, which made
as to ply our Pumps to clear it of
water.



On the ninteenth the Weather grew
fair, and gave us leasure to set to rights
what the Sea had disordered. The first
night wherein this bad weather hap∣pened,
the Frigat that was with me
left us, the rendesvouz being at the
Cape of Good Hope. Keeping on our
course we had more hard weather, which
much incommoded us, the waves bea∣ting
against our Ship in such a man∣ner
as threatened great danger.


On the tenth of 
March,
 about two
hours after noon, we perceived a Ves∣sel,
at first I thought it was that which
had left me, but coming nearer, we
saw her carrying English Colours, and
being willing to hear. News, and sup∣posing
she came from 
Europe;
 I came
up to her, and sent out my long Boat
with an Officer, to know if there were
any Wars, for when a man has been
long at Sea, one Knows not whom to
trust; word was brought me 'twas an
English Merchant-Man, who, had par∣ted
from 
London
 five months since,
and had touched now here, and that
he intended streight for 
Tonquoin,
 that
the Captain had told him that there


was no War in 
France,
 and that all

Europe
 was at Peace; but yet there
had been some troubles in 
England

occasioned by the Duke of 
Monmouth,

who had placed himself at the Head of
ten or twelve thousand men, but that the
King's Troops had routed them, and
taken him Prisoner; and that he was
beheaded, and several of his Followers
hanged, and so this rebellion was ended.
He also told us that he had seen Land
the day before seven Leagues off, which
made us judge that we were thirty or
thirty five Leagues off of it. We held
on our course the rest of the day and
night, and the next morning at ten
of the clock we spied Land, seven or
eight Leagues off us; I sounded and we
found fourscore fathom and upward,
we clapt on all our Sail to endeavour
to get before night to the Cape of
Good Hope; the next morning at
break of day we saw it and doubled
it; about ten of the clock we espied
a Vessel windward of us, and drawing
near we found 'twas the Frigat, which
left us near the Isle of 
Maurice;
 this
was the second time we met after our


separation, both together at the place
of our appointment, which seldom
happens on the Sea. When I was
ready to cast Anchor the wind blew
so hard against us, that I was forced
to tack about and Anchor at the Isle
of 
Robins,
 which is about three Lea∣gues
from the Fort of the Cape; the
next morning being the thirteenth of

March
 we weighed Anchor, and went
and rode near the Fort, where I arrived
about two of the clock: I found there
nine Vessels which came from 
Batavia,

and were bound for 
Europe.
 I sent the
Ghevalier 
Cibois
 to Complement the
Governour, and to ask his leave to
send eight or ten sick people on shoar,
and take in fresh water and necessary
Browisions. He received respectfully
my Complement, and bid the Officer
tell me, I was Master, and that I might
do what I pleased. Arriving there in
Autumn, wherein all Fruits are good,
he sent me Melons, Grapes and Salads,
I saluted the Fort with seven Cannon;
for the King's order is to salute the
Forts first, and they were exactly an∣swered.
The Vessel which carried the


Admiral's Flag, saluted me afterwards
with seven pleces, and I returned him
the same Civility. There were in this
fleet three flag Ships, to wit, the Ad∣miral,
Vice-Admiral and Counter-Ad∣miral.
The Fruit which was sent me
were excellent good, as well as the Sa∣lads,
and so were the Melons and
Grapes; I went to land, and walked
in their Garden, which made me re∣member
those in 
France,
 for as I alrea∣dy
said, 'twas a very fine one, and
well kept; the great quantity of Pulse
growing there is very gratefull to Sea∣faring
Men, the Governour was no Nig∣gard,
ordering us what we pleased.


He is a Man of sense, and well be∣comes
the place he holds, in which 'tis
said, if he remains long, he will make
his Fortune: When there be any 
Hol∣landers

that will dwell there, he gives
them as much Land as they will, builds
them a House, gives them Oxen for
Tillage, and all other Cattel and Uten∣sils
of Husbandry that are necessary;
all which is valued, and when they
are able they pay the Company for
them. They are obliged to fell all the


Fruits of their Lands to the Comapany,
at a certain price, which is advanta∣gious
to both parties. The Wine that
they buy of them for sixteen Crowns an
Hogshead, they sell for an hundred to
strangers, and to their own Fleets which
pass this way; that is to say, to the
Seamen who drink it on the spot; Sheep
and Oxen are sold also proportionably,
which brings a great Revenue to the
Company; and makes their Fleets re∣fresh
themselves at small charge, and
remain whole months there, according
to their occasions.


When I arrived, 'twas not long since
the Governour was returned from a
Discovery which he had made of Gold
and Silver Mines. 'Tis said that there
are many, and that they lie easie and
shallow. He was two hundred and fifty
Leagues up the Countrey; he carried
along with him three or four 
Outan∣tosts,

who spake Dutch, who lead him to
the next Nation, which was likewise 
Ou∣tantosts,

and took others in his way. He
met with near nine different Nations,
or sorts of People, some of which he
took along with him, according as he


changed the People, to make himself
understood; he has, I am told, gotten
great light in what he aimed at; he
says the last Nation is the most po∣lished,
and that they came before him
Men and Women dancing, being all
clothed with the skins of Tygers, which
hung down to their Feet. He brought
one of these 
Outantosts,
 whom he has
caused to be taught Dutch, to return
thither the next Year. All these seve∣ral
People have many Cattle, and this
is their Revenue. The Governour had
with him fifty Souldiers, a Painter to
draw colours of Beasts, Birds, Ser∣pents;
and such Plants as he should find;
one to observe the course they took,
and a Pylot, for they went always by
the Compass, and drove along with
them three hundred Oxen, to carry
their Provisions, and draw fourteen or
fifteen Carts; when they met with any
Mountains they dismounted their Car∣riages,
and took out whatsoever was
therein, and loaded the Oxen with it,
and thus passed over them. Being ad∣vanced
in the Countrey, they were
three or four days before they could


find any Water, which much incom∣moded
them; he was five Months and
an half in this Journey.


He met with several wild Bea
s, and
says that the Elephants are Monsters,
far exceeding in bigness those of the

Indies;
 as also Rhinocero's of a prodi∣gious
size. He saw one with which he
thought he should have been killed;
for when this Animal is in a fury, there
is no weapon can stop him, his Skin is
hard, and a Musquet shot cannot pierce
it; they have two Horns which grow
together in the Skin of this Animal.


The Abode I made at the Cape fur∣nished
me with Fish during the time of
Lent. I saw a Whale of the largest size,
I think which came within less than a
Pistol shot of our Vessel; there were al∣so
store of Birds, which gave us the
same diversion as those which I have
already mentioned.

Considering the Cape of Horn
beaks, and I made to the Bay of
the Cape of Good Hope 33


The total 2158 Leagues.




On the twenty sixth of 
March
 at two
in the afternoon, I set Sail with a
good Wind; in leaving the Bay near
the Dutch Fort of the Cape of Good
Hope, I saw three Vessels who made
towards the Cape, but I could not di∣stinguish
of what Nation they were, I


believe them to have been Dutch, be∣cause
this number was expected from
the Isle of 
Ceilan.
 After we had past
forty Leagues from thence, we found
the Sea very boisterous, which gave us
much trouble, but we continued on
our course to pass the Line in the same
longitude we did before. Our Voyage
must needs be pleasant, for as I alrea∣dy
noted, the King of 
Siam
 sent with
us Ambassadors into 
France,
 to shew
the King how earnestly he desired his
Friendship; his great Qualities and Re∣nown
having reached his Ears, and
been long since known in the 
Indies.

He told me in an Audience, that he
would give them no Instructions in
point of Ceremony, those of 
France

being very different from his King∣dom's,
because he was persuaded the
King would not require any thing of
them prejudicial to his Honour, and
that he would leave me to counsel them
what they had to doe when they came
to 
France;
 that he relied upon me for
this, being sure I would not impose
upon them. We had then with us three
Ambassadors, the most considerable


Persons in 
Siam.
 The first is Brother
to the late deceased 
Barcalon,
 who was
the King's Chief Minister, a Man of
sense, having been ever concerned with
his Brother in all his greatest Affairs;
this Person, accompanied with another,
came and received me at the mouth of
the River of 
Siam,
 when I arrived, and
has been ever with me, attending me
wherever I went. The first time I saw
him he seemed to me an ingenious Per∣son,
free from all affectation and re∣servedness,
which made me tell Mon∣sieur

Constans
 that he would be a very
fit Man to be sent over Ambassador to

France.
 The second is aged, and wants
not wit, having been Ambassador in

China,
 and acquitted himself to the
King his Master's Satisfaction. The
third is aged about twenty five or thir∣ty
years, his Father is Ambassador in

Portugal;
 these are the best natured
People in the World very easie and
obliging, good humoured, and their
Friendship is not to be regarded as un∣profitable.
They write down the smal∣lest
matters they see, and I like that
the better, seeing they will have Ob∣servations


enough in 
France,
 neither do
I doubt but they will give a true Ac∣count
of them to their Master.


They should have had twelve 
Man∣darins

for their Retinue, but they have
but eight, four of them being left be∣hind
at 
Siam,
 because they came not
soon enough on board; they brought
with them twelve young Youths, to
learn the Tongue, and Trades, but part
of them are also left behind with the

Mandarins.
 The Abbat 
de Lionne
 was
entreated by this King to go to 
France

with his Ambassadors, because he speaks
their Language. The King also told
Mr. 
Vacher,
 that he would be very glad
that he would return with his Ambas∣sadors,
which he has also done; he
will be to them of great use, being an
active Person. We have also with us
Monsr. the Abbat 
de Choisy,
 who went
to 
Siam
 to reside there in quality of
Ambassador, in case the King should
become a Christian; he is a very ho∣nest.
Gentleman, and wants no good
quality. He said his first Mass on board
us, and gave us several good Sermons;
Monsr. the Abbat 
du Charter
 was of our


company, an able and honest Preacher.
Mr. 
Vaudricourt
 was the Captain of our
Vessel; he is a Gentleman admira∣bly
well qualified for his Place, taking
care of every thing that concerned
him, and gave us all content.


There have remained about twelve or
fifteen French men at 
Saim,
 in the Ser∣vice
of that King, or Mr. 
Constans


I Continued my course till I dame
near to the Isle of St. 
Pleten
 which is
inhabited by English; such Ships as
come from the 
Indies
 touch there, that
is to say when they go not to the
Cape of Good Hope; I was told it
was a very good and fruitfull Island,
it lyes six Degrees Latitude Southwards
I past on in sight of the Isle of 
As∣cension

which is eight degrees South∣ward
of the Line. This Isle is not in∣habited,
most Vessels make some stay
here to take Tortoises, there being
here great numbers of them, and they
are no small refreshment to Sea-faring
men; they live a month or six weeks
without eating, they can onely be ta∣ken
a nights, for in the day time they
keep to the Sea, and at night come


to Land to lay their Eggs, which they
hide in the sand. To take them you
must
ly hid with a great stick in your
hand, and surprise them when they come
out of the water, and throw them on
their backs, and then they cannot stir;
a man may strike fourscore or an
hundred in a night. Here Vessels come
on purpose to take these animals and
salt them, and then carry them to the
Isles in 
America,
 being bought by
the Inhabitants for their Slaves. Ha∣ving
a good wind I tarried not long
here, not being willing to lose time
in passing the Equinoctial Line; for
sometimes a man is forced to be long
about it by reason of calms and rains
to be met there: The twenty eighth of

April
 I past the Line most happily, the
heats no wise incommoding us; this is
the fourth time I past it without lea∣ving
my Cloth Suit; all our men were
in health excepting four or five, who
were sick of the Gripes, which Dis∣temper
they brought from 
Siam;
 this
Distemper is seldom cured in that
Countrey, and I lost about ten or
twelve men who died of it. We saw


but few Fish all along, which is unusual,
for one commonly meets with great
quantities: We took one about eight
foot long and four foot broad, he had
a hole on the to pof his head, through
which he breaths, and throws up wa∣ter
into the air like a fountain; he
made a great noise, and weighed about
three hundred weight, he is good to eat.
On the twenty ninth we took two
more Fish which weighed about an
hundred and fifty a piece. We were
on the Northern Coasts, having a good
wind; I was about thirty two days
coming from the Cape of Good Hope
to the Line.


On the sixteenth of 
May
 about
midnight we past the Tropick accor∣ding
to the best judgment our Pylots
could make in taking the height. On
the seventeenth about noon, this being
the sixth time we past the Tropicks
in this Voyage, we left by the benefit
of a good wind the Torrid Zone.


The first of 
June
 we saw Land, when
we thought we werea bove an hundred
and fifty Leagues off it; this surprised
us, because there arose great mists


we were obliged to draw near it, and
the weather clearing, we found it was
the Isle of 
Flora,
 which is one of the

Aures,
 and which lyes most Westward,
and stands high, there falls from its
mountains great water courses into the
Sea. We needed swift streams to car∣ry
us to the West, which we gained
above an hundred and fifty Leagues
Eastward. The fifth we saw a Vessel
that came near us, but it being night
we knew not what she was, on the
seventh we saw another which advan∣ced
towards us, I sent an Officer on
board in my long Boat, who brought
me word it was an English Vessel that
came from 
Virginia
 and was bound to

London,
 she was laden with Tobacco;
and there being a great wind, and we
out sailing her, soon left her behind
us. We had variable weather till the
twelvth, but about six of the clock at
night, having a Western wind, the Sea
grew so boisterous, it blowing hard
also that we were forced to let down
all our sail and cast Anchor being with∣in
an hundred Leagues distant from

Brest.
 The weather being very cloudy


and showery; we kept off the Land
as much as possible, for these blasts
of winds lasts sometimes eight days
together, but about ten of the clock
at night on the thirteenth the wind
grew calm, and we again set sail, and
on the eighteenth of 
June
 arrived in
the Road of 
Brest,
 at four in the af∣ternoon,
where as soon as we had
cast Anchor I made both our Ships
fire their Guns to salute the Ambas∣sadors
of 
Siam,
 which I brought along
with me.
