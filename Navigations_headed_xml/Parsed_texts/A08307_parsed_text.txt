The Discription of 
Hartfordshire.


HARTFORDSHIRE taketh
 name of the Towne called HARTFORDE and the Towne of the passage ouer the Riuer.


The passage as (M. 
Camden
 sup∣poseth) is HERVDFORDE, 
Vadum rubrum.


It may be also, both consonant to the sounde and to the nature and scituation of the place, 
vadum ceruinum.
 THE PASSAGE OF DEERE of that kinde whereof the chiefe males were eal∣led 
Hartes,
 in former ages: at this day Stagges. The disposition of this part of the countrie, to forrest and weldish groundes, fitte for the fostering of such kinde of wilde beastes, doth much more argue it to be HARTESFORDE, then HERVD, for THE RVDFORD. As I coniecture.


Moreouer, not farre from the towne, is a place called HAR∣TINGFORD, which signifieth 
vadumad ceruinum pratum,
 or 
ad ceruinum pascuum.


This Shire was part of that countrey where 
Ptolomey
 placed the
 
Cattieuctani:
 who possessed the greatest part of this 
Buckingham
 and 
Bedfordshires.


It hath on the East 
Essex,
 on the north 
Cambridshire
 and 
Bedford∣shire,
 West and South 
Buckinghamshire
 and 
Middlesexe.


As touching vicecountile iurisdiction, before and long after the
 time of Edw. 3. it was annexed to 
Essex.
 And one Sheriffe supplied both Countics, as did also one Eschetor.


Concerning the Soyle:
 It is for the most part, chalkie, though the vpper cruste in the South and West parts, be for the most part of redde earth mixed with grauell, which yet by reason of the white marle vnder it, yeeldeth good wheat and oates: But of it owne nature most enclined to 
ood, and coupisses, affording also faire wayes. In the North part of the Shire, as in the hundreds of 
Hitche,
 and 
Oddesey,
 the soyle is very apt to yeeld corne, and dertie wayes, especially that part which is accompted parcell of a vayle


called of the countrie men the 
vayle
 of 
Ring-tayle
 or 
Wring-tayle
 or
 rather 
Ringdale,
 which extendeth it selfe also into 
Cambridg-shire.
 And affordeth no small store of wheat and malte towards the pro∣uision of 
London.


This Shire at this day is, and more hath beene heretofore, much repleat with parkes woodes and riuers. But for deepe feedinges or
 large sheepe pastures, I could take notice of fewe, and they especi∣ally about KNEBWORTH the best sheepe gates within the Shire,


Meadowes here and there, are dispersed vpon the riuers sides: But many of them colde and mossye, especially about RICK∣MANSWORTH. The LEA challengeth the commenda∣tion for the best meadowes, the North parte of the Shire is much vnfurnished.


To speake of the Soyle as in deede it is most generally, for my part I take it but a barraine countrie, in respecte of some other
 Shires, without the industrious toyle & charge of the thirstie hus∣bandman.


It is much benefited by thorrow fares to and from 
London
 North∣wardes, and that maketh the markets to bee the better furnished with such necessaries, as are requisite for Innes, for th'intertaine∣ment of trauaylers. And I take it (though it be one of the least) no one Shire in England for the quantitie commes neere it for tho∣row-fare places of competent receit.


The ayre for the most partis very salutarie, and in regard there∣of,
 many sweete and pleasant dwellinges, healthfull by nature and profitable by arte and industrie are planted there: And aboue o∣ther Shires there are many auncient Sites, houses in former ages famous, commonly called BERYES, which are in other Shires
 called 
Halls, Courte-houses,
 and 
Mannorplaces.
 The most part of these BERRYES are Mannors or Lordshippes of themselues, the worde BERRYE 
sodem significat:
 a dwelling place or place of
 aboad, 
inde Connie beryes,
 a refuge for Connyes.


But the worde 
Berye
 is often confounded with 
Burrough, Burye
 and 
Berge:
 euery of which haue their distinct significations: BVRROW
 
oppidem:
 BVRYE, 
sepulchrum:
 BERG, 
montem significat:
 And BERYE sometime is taken 
pro castro▪ et exercitus castrametatione.
 And therefore in regard of the antiquitie of these 
Beryes,
 I thought it not superfluous, to obserue the most of name, and to insert them in the Mappe, though now they carrie not equall glorie in outward shewe, with som of inferiour condition: for the most part of them hauing lost their auncient Lords, or the Lords let them for so loftie rentes, as that they are sackt of their antique royalties, and bereft of their former beautie.


This Shire is deuided into 7. hundreds and ½ namely:


ODDESEY hundred, which taketh name of an auncient


house called ODDESEY GRAVNGE which standeth
 neere old WATLINE-STREET, and abutteth parte on 
Bed∣fordshire,
 and part on 
Cambridgshire,
 and aboundeth especially with corne.


EDWINESTRE hundred bordereth vpon Essex.


BRAWGHING hundred taketh name of a parishe of that
 name, and boundeth vpon 
Edwinestree.


HARTFORD hundred is named of 
Hartford
 the prouincial towne of the Shire.


BROADWATER hundred, so tearmed of a little hamlet
 of 2. or 3. houses neere Steuen edge.


COISHOO hundred, or CAEGSHOO, is named of
 an anncient Berye, called 
Caishoo-berye, de
 CASSIIS of a people mentioned by 
Caesar
 resident in this hundred as 
M. Camden
 affir∣meth. 
See more of this vnder that name in the table of parishes.


DACORVM hundred, (as I am out of doubt) 
de Dacis
 of the
 
Danes,
 who in this hundred, after many spoiles committed by them were ouerthrowne by 
Adelnulph,
 and Adelbalde his sonne about the yeere of Christ 8 29. And in memoriall of their ouerthrow, and stoppe of their further passage that way at that time, the place where the fight was is to this day called DANE ENDE 
Daco∣rum clades.
 And neere it in the highway towardes 
Steuen edge,
 are
 many burials, great heapes of earth, vnder which are enterred, such as were slaine, at that conflict as may be supposed.


HITCH halfe hundred, so called of a wood called HITCH∣WOOD, and not of 
Hitchin
 towne, which indeed is HITCH∣ENDE, 
terminus de Hitch,
 and not 
Hitch-ing,
 as it is corruptly tear∣med, and the hundred is HITCH-HAVLFE 
hundred
 not 
Hitchnie
 nor 
Hitching haulfe hundred.


This Shire is well furnished with market townes, the most of them plentifull of all thinges necessarie for the peoples reliefe: namelie.

The deuision of the Shire.


THe Iustices of the Shire for the more ease of themselues and
 the cōmon people, haue by consent deuided the whole Shire into 3. partes or deuisions, for the determination of matters of meanest moment.

Hartford,
 where is also the common gaole for the Shire, and in the
 Castle the gaole deliuerie, except onely for the libertie of S. AL∣BANS which both for ecclesiasticall & eiuill gouernement, hath peculiar power within it selfe, whose Iurisdiction reacheth into these parishes, namely:

To speake something of the Riuers that water this Countrie, the STORT may be first mentioned, because it lyeth farthest in the East, and is the Bound betweene this Shire and 
Essex:
 But that this Shire steppeth ouer the riuer, both at 
Stortford,
 and neere 
Sabridg∣worth,
 and fetcheth within her limits about 
Stortford,
 the 
Castle of Waymore Hockerell,
 the parsonage of 
Stortford,
 with other thinges in 
Essex
 side, and at 
Sabsworth
 or 
Sabridgeforde
 it depriueth 
Essex
 of a house called HYDE-HALL.


Some, as I take it in tearming this 
Stort
 the STOVR are not
 meerely mistaken, for though the 
Stowrē
 parteth 
Suffolke
 and 
Essex,
 and riseth at STOVR-MER, the 
Stort
 riseth in 
Essex
 also neere WENDON LOWGHES and signifieth 
Wendod water,
 and beginnes to deuide the two Shires betweene 
Stortford
 and 
Fernham
 about a mile aboue 
Stortford:
 And may in deede not amisse be cal∣led 
Stowret,
 THE LESSER OR LITTLE STOWR.
 And the passage ouer the riuer neere 
Waymore Castle
 is called STOWRETFORD, briefely STORTFORD, whereof the Towne taketh name, and is called STORTFORD for 
Stow∣retsord.
 And vnder the name of the 
Stowret
 or 
Stort,
 it maintaineth
 that deuision, till it come beneath an auncient house called the REE, where it meeteth with the LEA or LAVE, who as the
 more worthie bereaues the little 
Stort
 of her title and glorie, and vnder the name of the 
Lea,
 they both in one hasten to WALT∣HAM ABBEY, and there bidde HARTFORDSHIRE 
vale,
 continuing her most milde course as stickler betweene 
Essex
 and 
Middlesex,
 vntill she present her selfe to famous 
Thames.


The LEA is the most famous Riuer within this Shire: And
 bringeth as it were a testimoniall of her worh from the 
Saxons,
 who entitled her LIGEAN or LIGEAM Lea water. And it may
 be supposed & probably gathered, that she yeelded in those pristine ages, some prayse-worthy fruites vnto that antique nation, as her free entertainement of boates and shippes, from the 
Thames
 euen to 
Hartford,
 for the more easie entercarriage of thinges betweene 
London
 & it, though now, & many yeers past, (as discontent) she
 hath refused that publique seruice affording onely, of late, accesse for small boates or barges to WAYRE, a benefite necessary and no way no some.


This Riuer hath many braunches, but her head first seemeth to looke into the light, not farre from an auncient house, called of the spring there, LEA-MER, corruptly LAMER, which signi∣fieth



the head, spring or well of LEA. As the 
Stowre
 which passeth betweene 
Suffolke
 and 
Essex,
 beginneth at STOVR-MER, the
 head or spring of 
Stoure.


The 
Lea
 coasteth as it were through the Center of the Shire, deuiding it neere into two equall partes, and in her passage, among
 other, she receyueth the WHITWELL riuer, whose auncient name is MARRAN. Entring the 
Lea
 west off Hartford, and be∣tweene that and 
Wayre,
 the BENE or auncient BENEFICI¦AN, a riuer that riseth not farre from BEINENTON or BE∣NINGTON increaseth the 
Lea,
 not farre from a place alluding also to that name called BENGEHOO or rather BENEHOO
 the riuer of 
Bene
 by interpretation.


A third braunch, which first riseth about 
Barkeway, Austie,
 and 
Buntingford,
 maketh way by 
Brawghing,
 and neere 
Bengehoo
 entereth the 
Lea.


A fourth braunch, riseth about the 
Pelhames,
 making way by the 
Hadhames,
 and East off 
Wayre
 greeteth the 
Lea.


The RFDBVRNE riuer riseth not farre from 
Flamsted
 an
 auncient Baronie, and thence passeth by 
Redburne,
 and in her way towardes the decayes of old 
Verlam,
 it greeteth the Lady of 
Pree
 S. MARIA DE PRATIS a Nunnerie and a kind neighbor
 to 
Albans
 Abbey. This fall of water, was called VERLAME, as Antiquaries obserue, and thereof VEROLANIVM, and VERLAMECESTER: whereby it may be gathered that the former 
Flamsted
 where this 
Verlame
 water first appeareth, should be rather VERLAMSTED then 
Flamsted: Flamsted
 being more
 easie to be pronounced, and so drowning verlam with flam, as in ma∣ny wordes f. is taken for the u. consonant, and that u. fot f. especi∣ally among the common people, that pronounce vather sometime for father. This 
Verlam
 riuer or the 
Redbourne
 was the foode that relieued that famous great poole which was betweene 
Verlamcester
 and 
Holmehurst
 hill where 
Albans
 towne standeth: Of which poole so many coniectures hauebeene, that it should be part of the flow∣ing 
Thames,
 whereof is spoken hereafter in S. 
Albans.


This 
Verlame
 or 
Redburne
 Riuer not much belowe 
Albans
 towne, offereth her selfe to the COLNE, a riuer that there imbraceth
 her, and drowning both the names of 
Verlame
 and 
Redbourne,
 vsur∣peth the whole ritle and glorie to her selfe, and immediatly beget∣teth COLNEY and COLNEY-STREET, and passing on she
 visiteth WATFORD or WATLINGFORD, the aunci∣ent ruynes of 
Morhouse, Rickmansworth, Vxbridge
 and another of her begotten called COLN-EBROOKE, and so without stay shee
 submitteth herselfe to the 
Thams,
 the mained euouring gulfe of all these petite streames.


This riuer ere it commes to 
Riokemansworth
 deuoureth 
Caishoo
 ri∣uer
 and another that falles out of 
Buckinghamshire.

Villa Albani.
 ALBANS TOWNE first founded by 
Offa
 K. of the 
Mercees,
 in perpetuall memorie of
 
Alban
 in the 33 yeere of his raigne. The Towne is said to be buil∣ded in the place where 
Alban
 was martyred, namely vpon a hill in a wood called HOLMEHVRST of 
Beda
 DOVRS∣WALDT: which is the wood neere the water, meaning the great Stagne, which was betweene 
Verlame
 and the place of 
Alban
 exe∣cution. 
Alban
 was a Cittizen of 
Verolame,
 and by bloud a Romane, and gaue entertainement to 
Amphibal
 at his comming to that citie. by whom he was from Paganisme conuerted to the Christian faith,
 for which he suffered as 
Capgraue
 affirmeth, whose further friuo∣lous reportes of the miracles wrought by this holy Conuert, liuing and dead, I leaue as idle or needelesse▪ onely it seemeth probable that such a man there was executed at that place, and for his eter∣nall commemoration, this 
Albans
 Monasterie was founded, and consequently the towne, both consecrate to his owne name. And endowed with many large priuiledges and dayly augmented and successiuely confirmed, by the charters of many Kings of this Land
 whereof I haue seene and read not a sewe; signed onely 
signo crucis
 without further ceremonie of sealing.


This Monasterie hath bene enlarged by sundrie Abbots of this place, as especially by 
Eldred
 and 
Edmer
 about 
Eadgars
 time, and in 
Edward
 3. time, who gaue the then Abbot 
Licentiam ad confirmardam et kernellandam Abathiam de calce et petra:
 in the 31. yeere of his raigne ouer England, and of his raigne ouer Fraunce the 18.


Such were the priuiledges of this place, that the King coulde make no secular officer ouer them, but by their owne consent.


They were acquitted of all 
Toll
 through England.


They made Iustices 
ad audiendum et terminandum,
 within them∣selues,


and no other Iustice could call them for any matter out of their libertie.


They made also Bayliffes and Corroners.


No Bishoppe had any Iurisdiction to correct any person among them for any matter spirituall or temporall.


They had the execution and returne of all writs, and the goodes of all Outlawes: and that is yet continued to the Towne by the
 graunt of 
Edward
 6. And no man may bee impanelled out of the Towne.


They had gayle and gayle deliuerie within the towne: and the towne at this day hath the like, namely one gayle for the libertie,
 and another for the towne. For the gayle deliuerie, the Steward of the towne is alwayes in commission, but not by their Charter.


The towne is gouerned by a Maior and 10. Burgesses, a stewarde and a Chamberlaine.


There are in the towne 4. Wards and in euery Ward a Constable and 2. Churchwardens.


In the Abbey church of this place is a Font of brasse brought out of 
Scotland
 by 
Sir Richard Lée:
 as may appeare by a circum∣scription about the same font, as if the font did proclaime the same in it owne person in these wordes.

M. D. XLIIII.
 & 
Henrici octaui. XXXVI.


In this Abbey church lyeth buried famous 
Sir Iohn Mandeuile
 liuely formed in a marble stone: whose trauayles in forraine regions and rare reportes, are at this time admired through the world.


There lie also many Nobles, who lost their liues in the conflictes
 in and neere this towne, betweene the houses of 
Lancaster
 and 
Yorke.


In the North-west ende of the towne was sometime a stately castle, and called 
KINGSBERRIE,
 which is as much, as the
 Kinges house or castle, for BERRYE 
castrum et castrametationem significat:
 the ruines thereof doe yet somewhat appeare, the place now supplied with a farme house. The Abbot of that place in the time of K. 
Stephen
 made suite vnto the K. to ouerthrowe and sup∣plant the same castle, for that (as he suggested) 
Antiquis tempori∣bus latebant quidam regales nequam homines, Abbatis minus infesti et damnosi.
 At whose instance the castle was forthwith ouerthrowne.


There was sometime a great Meere or stagne, betweene this towne and olde 
Verolamium▪
 and many haue constantly, but idlely affirmed, that the 
Thames
 hath had issue that way, and nauigable so farre, a thing meerely fabulous, though it be true, that an ancker


was sometime founde there. It was indeede 
Stagnum maximum
 an ample and large fishpoole of the Kinges, and belonged to his ca∣stle of Kingsberie before spoken of: And the Kinge for his recre∣ation, and delight lying there, did often passe by boate, to and fro within the same, according to the order of the noble men and gen∣tlemen of 
Rome,
 who did vsually, make fayre fishpondes aboute their houses, to recreate themselues therein: and these with ex∣ceeding cost, as 
Marcus Varro
 wryteth especially of the wonder∣full large and costly fishpondes of 
Hortentius, Hircius
 and 
Lucullus.
 And of these, and such other princely Romans, did these 
Verlame
 Citizens, take president for this great ponde, which comming af∣terwardes to the king of the land, he often tooke his repasle there∣in, accompanyed commonly with no smalle troupe of his nobles, and therefore the boates, were prouided of large hull, furnished with cable and ancer, that at the kings pleasure, the boate might be moared in any parte of the poole, whereby, how easie it is to loose an ancre in the meere reason may iudge, and this was the occasion of the losse, of the ancre doubtlesse that was found there, and not ordinarie recourse of shippes as some vainely suppose. And yet as 
Ouid
 sayth: 
& vetus inuenta est in montibus anchora summis.
 This fish∣poole
 continued in this pryde, till the time of 
Alfric
 the seuenth Abbott of this Monastery, who bought the same of the king, and by industry and charge caused it to be drayned drie: And the more to argue it to be but a fishpoole there remayneth yet one witnesse, a streete in the towne lying towardes it called FISHPOOLE∣STREETE.


If any boates in former times, came thither, they came from 
Staenes
 and vp the 
Colne
 riuer to 
Rickmansworth,
 to 
Watforde
 and so to S. 
Albans,
 but in no sence to the place where the ancre was founde, for that the fall of the water there was such as it coulde yeelde no accesse for shipping against the same. There is indeede a feilde be∣lowe S. 
Albans
 called 
key feyld,
 and belowe 
Rickmansworth,
 a place vpon the riuer called 
Westhythe,
 which may in sort argue some such passage for boates, but for the first it may bee aswell 
pascuum, vacci∣num
 a pastour for kye, or kyne, as a strande for fastening of boates or ships & more like. And 
Westhithe
 may be as wel taken for a house as for a harbour of ships. And yet these simple probabilities might worke that conceite in 
Gildas,
 who was the authour of this error.


In and about this towne, haue beene sundry battelles conflictes
 and spoyles, as in the time of Henrie 3. one 
Falcatius de Brent
 a no∣torious robber, with a companie of wicked persons came too this towne by night, spoyled the same and murthered many: and would haue set the Abbey on fire, But the Abbot feed him with 100 pound to depart.


This was a dangerous time when theeues and murtheres must be hyred for rewarde and not constrayned by iustice, to desist from


violence and bloud.


In the same yeare it was ransackt againe by the souldiees, that went vnder the conduct of Earle 
Patric, Sayre
 and others to remoue
 the seidge of 
Mount Sorrell.


Moreouer, about the yeare 1455. Henrie 6. of the famelie of 
Lancaster
 with many of his nobles, at this towne mett with 
Richard
 Duke of 
Yorke,
 and his adnerentes, where the king was taken, and
 a great slaughter made vpon his men, euen of best accoumpt. But afterwardes within 4. yeares neere the same, at a place called by the inhabitants BERNET FEYLD but I take it rather 
Brentes feild,
 of the former 
Falcatius de Brent,
 such as stood affected to the fa∣mely of 
Lancaster,
 vnder the conduct of 
Margaret
 the Queene, migh∣tily preuayled against the complices of the house of 
Yorke,
 to the infranchesing of the Captaiue king, and ouerthrowe of many of
 the aduerse parte.


In the middle of this towne is a crosse, verie stately erected a∣bout the yeare of Christ 1290. by Edward 1. as in many other pla∣ces, in memoriall of the death and dolefull carriage of his Queene, from. 
Herdbie
 nere 
Lincolne
 where shee dyed, towardes 
Westminster
 where she was buryed.


At this place was executed that Libellor aud stirrer of the com∣mons named 
Iohn Ball
 in the time of Richard the 2.


The terme is sometime kept in the Abbey chutch where all pla∣ces are orderly prouided for the same.


AMWELL. h. 28. which signifieth 
fontem amnensem
 a well by the riuers side.


ANSTIE. b. 30. At this place are the ruynes and deepe tren∣ches of a stronge castle, scituate aloft on a steepe hi
l, and was cal∣led HANST-HYE castle 
depraecipitio.
 I take it of the stepe∣nesle of it.


ASPENDEN. d. 24. so called eyther 
detremules

cauerna viperina
 a place of venemous wormes.

Antoninus
 termth in his ltenerari 
MAGIOVINIVM
 And he prooueth it by the signification of the worde 
Magionirdum,
 chaunging only n. for u. which then signifieth a nurserie for Ashes, and so much doth the nature of the place fitly import▪


ASHRIDGE. i. 10. 
Iugum fraxinium,
 at this place was an her∣mitage built by 
Edward Beanforde
 Earle of 
Cornewall,
 wherein (so it
 was esteemed) 
Edward
 1. kept a royall Christmas. Wherein also our moste worthie and euer famous Queene 
Elizabeth
 lodged as in her owne, (being then a more stately house) at the iime of 
Wy∣atts
 attempt in Queene 
Maryes
 dayes. And from this place she was in all post sent for to the courte, by such seuere Commissionars, that


though she were then sicke, she was forced to take her iourney with them. The worthy history whereof to our perpetuall ioy, for that the high 
Iehouah
 seeing her innocencie preserued her to the regall throane, is at large set downe in our Chronicles.


This place is lately beautified by the Lord 
Cheyney.






B.


BARHAMSTED.
 k. 8. or rather BERGHAMSTEDT 
villa sita inter montes
 BERG in the Saxon tonge is a hil, HAM a towne, and STEDT or STADT a place or seat, and the
 scituation of this place agreeth to the former interpretation.


Nere vnto this towne was a stronge castle, the ruynous walles and some buildinges thereof yet remaine. It was builded (as M. 
Camden
 affirmeth) by the 
Normans.


The Conqueror, in deede stayd there, as histories report, as he passed through the country, And thither resorted vnto him many Lordes and nobles of the Realme, At which time, it is like, he gaue
 order for the erecting of the castle, if it were not a castle when he made stay there, the beauty and strength of the castle, is now ad∣uaunced on a loftie hill, stataly and pleasant not farre from the olde site, not holding the former forme of a castle, but is become with addition and charge a beautifull house, by Sir 
Edward Carry
 knight M. of her maiesties lewell house.


Lewes
 of 
Frauncè
 beseiged this castle against Henrie 3. the first yeare of his raigne, in the time of which seige certayne knightes and souldiers salied out of the castle, adn depriued the aduersary of
 sundry pillage, and safely returned. But afterward at the kinges commaundement it was yelded vp to 
Lewes.


Richard
 king of 
Almane
 dyed in this castle who was also Earle of 
Cornewall,
 and brother to Henry 3. And Cicelie mother to Edward the fourth. And wife too the Duke of 
Yorke,
 too whome the
 castle belonged, ended her dayes in this place in the time of Henry 7. after she had seene the deserued fall of vsurping 
Richard▪
 who was also borne in this castle, some say at 
Fotheringay.


There is in the towne of 
Barkhamsted
 a fayre free Schoole built of bricke, by doctor 
Incent
 sometime deane of 
Paules,
 the stipend
 of the Master is 20. pound 
per annum,

BERNET
 feyld k. 16. a place vulgarly so called, but corruptly as I take it, it should be rather 
Brentes
 feyld, of that 
Fulcatius de Brent
 spoken of before in S. 
Albans,
 who with a troupe of wicked men, a∣bout this place robbed and murthered many.


In this feyld, was the matter handled by deadly blowes, betweene Queene 
Margaret
 leading the fauourers of the house of 
Lancaster,
 and the complices of the house of 
Yorke,
 & where she redeemed the king that was taken before at the battell of S.

Before the Conquest by the 
Normans,
 it did belonge to the Abbey of S. 
Albans,
 and at that generall spoyle and confusion of thinges it was taken away, and 
Lanfranck
 being afterwards Arch∣bishoppe of 
Canterbury
 wrought the restauration of it againe, about the beginning of 
Rufus
 raigne.


This Church was defaced and spoyled, with many other there aboutes in the time of Henrie 3.


At this place were founde the reliques of 
Amphiball,
 who is saide
 to be the instructour and conuertour of 
Alban
 from Paganisme, of whose reliques such was the regard, that the Abbottes of the mona∣stetie of 
Alban
 had, that they should be deuoutly preserued, that a
 decree was made, by 
Thomas
 then Abbott, that a pryor and three munckes should be appointed to this holie function, whose allow∣ance


in those dayes amounted yearely to 20. pound or vpwardes, as much as three hundred pound in this age. Such was the price and
 estimation of the lothsome reliques of dead mens bones.

 now famous for corne, standing in a very plentifull soyle: And is a verie fitte receptacle for traueilers that from the North partes haue recourse to 
London.


The towne was almost consumed with fire in the time of Henry the fourth.


In the time of Henrie 6. such was the plentie of corne, that in this
 place the best wheare was sould for twelue pence the quarter, three halfe pence the bushell.


The price was not then so lowe as it is now aloft, for it is at this present in the same place at eight shillinges the bushell.

VEROLAMIVM k, 18. the ruynes of a most auncient citie called of the 
Britons Cair Maricipit, Cair Municip, Cair Watteline
 of Ptolomey 
Verolanium,
 of the Saxons ƿerlamcester 
, a Citie vpon the riuer 
Werlame
 or 
Verlame.


This auncient decayed Citie seemeth at this day to publishe her pristine state and strength, on the west side of S 
Albans,
 by the reli∣ques of her defensiue walles, And at this day although 
Seges sit vbi erat Werlamcester,
 yet the sundry Roman coyns tumbled out of their
 obscure denns, by the painefull plough, doe, as it were, proclaime vnto vs, so many hundred yeares after her fall, that it is no fable that is written of her antiquitie.


The brasse monies whereof I haue much but seeme farre more, Import the antique names, and pictures, not only of sundry Empe∣rors, but of some of their Empresses also: which in those ages swayd the Romane monarchie, which argueth it to bee 
quondam,
 CAIR MVNICIP or 
Municipium,
 a citie, enfranchized and endowed,
 not only, with the ayde of the Romans by mony, but with their Ro∣mishe priuiledges also, the inhabitantes, for the most part being of the auncient britishe line: who deseruing well at the handes of the Romans▪ were made 
Municipes
 as it were free denizens of Rome, hauing their Lawes orders and officers, free among them, permit∣ted to liue vnder their ayde and protection, vntill through the fury
 of the 
Saxons
 and 
Danes
 it was sackt and subuerted, and of a hautie citie made an heape of stones, which as a 
Caos
 layd afterwards long


smothered in the ashes of her owne rubble and ruynes, without re∣gard, what it was or had beene. At length one 
Eldred
 Abbot of the
 new Monasterie of S. 
Albans,
 coueting to aduance the state of his monasticall sea, began to embowell this ruynate heape, to search what curious conceites, hee might finde to beautifie S. 
Albans
 sell. And founde in short time great varietie, of stone worke of sundrie kindes, and pillers of mettall as of Brasse, and Latton, towch and Allablaster. All which laide in heapes 
Eldred
 beheld to his no small ioy, but imploide them not according to his purpose intended, for death preuented him: But as curious a searcher as hee succeeded him one 
Eadmere,
 who had both a will and workemen, to sound fur∣ther
 into the bottome of this vnknowne gulfe, not ceassing till hee saw the very entrayles of this confused 
Caos,
 in whose most hidden∣vautes, he found sundry Idolls, and aulters not a fewe, superstiti∣ously adorned for the honour of these vnknown gods of the 
Pagans,
 some of these Idols were of pure golde, some of other metall, and withall he founde great store of housholde stuffe, and other thinges witnessing the glory both of the citie and the cittizens of the same. Besides sundry pottes of gould, brasse earth, glasse and other met∣tall,
 some frawght with the ashes of the dead, some with the coyne of the auncient 
Britons
 and Romane Emperours. And in a stone were found certayne Brytish bookes, whereof one imported the hi∣storie of 
Albans
 martyrdome.


In the ruynous walles of this Citie groweth licoras.


There are within the walles at this day the ruynes of an olde church called S. 
Germans.


The cause why it was called of the 
Brytons
 CAIR WATTE∣LINE was an auncient high way, begun by 
Dunwallow
 and fini∣shed by 
Guitheline,
 called as some thinke GVITHELINS∣STREET corruptly WATTELINE-STREET which cam
 by this citie from 
Douer
 leading Northwards.


About 70. yeares paste this high way, was founde at this place (though mentioned in historie many years before) 18. foote broad and 10. foote deepe, now almost leuell with the feyldes as is also the Citie.


Tantum aeui longinqua valet mutare vetustas.


And as Plato sayth.


Aeuum cuncta rapit furtiuaque tempora mutant.


Naturam sortem nominaque & faciem.


Alban
 was a citizen of this cittie, and being hoste vnto 
Amphiball
 became conuerted, from paganisme to the knowledge of Christ, and for the same was condemned and suffered, as is set downe before in S. 
Albans.

It began to bee moste famous in king
