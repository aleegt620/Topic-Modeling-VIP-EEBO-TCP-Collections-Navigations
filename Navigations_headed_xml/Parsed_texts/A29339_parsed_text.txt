TO THE READER.


THE 
Author
 of this 
Little Discourse
 was most certainly a 
French Protestant,
 and One who has been a 
Sufferer
 among the 
Rest
 in the late 
Persecution
 of the 
Reformed Religion
 in 
France.
 'Tis but a 
small Treatise,
 but it gives the 
World
 a 
large Prospect
 of the 
Violencies
 and 
Cruelties
 of the 
French Government,


 both at 
home
 and 
abroad;
 and the 
Miseries
 of those that lye under it's 
Oppression.
 How far it may have an 
Influence
 upon Other 
Nations,
 or An∣swer the 
Author's Expecta∣tion,
 who has made it his Bu∣siness to exhort them to the 
Recovery
 of their 
Liberty,
 wrested from them by 
Bribe∣ry, Breach
 of 
Leagues
 and 
Correspondence
 with the 
Turks
 Themselves, to the 
De∣struction
 of so many 
Families
 as have perished in the 
Deso∣lation
 of their 
Country
 and the Ruin of 
Christianity
 it

 self, I know not; but cer∣tainly to our 
own,
 it may be of 
Great Advantage,
 to make the 
People
 consider the 
Feli∣cities
 they enjoy under a 
King truly Most Christian,
 a 
just
 and 
peaceable Soveraign,
 and how much more happy they are than their 
Neighbours▪
 and how industriously they go a∣bout to bring Themselves into the same 
Condition
 by their own 
needless Discontents
 and 
Fiery Dissentions:
 Which certainly they would never do, did they but seriously weigh in the same 
Ballance
 the 
Arbi∣trary

 Dominion
 of the 
French
 hereafter displayed, and the 
Immunities
 and 
Advantages
 we Enjoy by the 
Excellent Composure
 of our 
Govern∣ment
 both 
in Church
 and 
State.














THE AMBITION OF FRANCE UPON EUROPE.


IT is no difficult thing to discern the Original of those Miseries under which we labour at this day: They who will give them∣selves the Trouble to reflect upon the Transactions, which have been the most remarkable for these 
Twen∣ty
 years last past in 
Europe,
 will agree with me, that if we had been so 
for∣tunate


 to have 
grown wife by our Suf∣ferings,
 we should not have seen our selves reduc'd to those 
Calamities
 un∣der which we now groan. For in short this is not the first time, that 
France
 has been known to have bro∣ken Leagues, tho never so sacred and inviolable. Her Ambition has not been able to keep her self reserv'd without appearing in her 
Colours.
 But we have been either so weak or so blind, as never to make a vigo∣rous opposition till it was too late. Therefore we can only impute our 
Misfortunes
 to our selves, and must ingeniously confess, that if we suf∣fer at this day the punishment of our 
Imprudence,
 'tis no more than what we justly deserve.


In a word, to whom ought we to impute the 
Imbecillity
 of the 
Spa∣niards


 but to our selves, who have so often contributed to reduce them to their present condition? Was it not easy for us to see, that they sup∣ported themselves only by the 
means
 of those 
Cabals,
 that were maintain'd in 
France
 against Cardinal 
Mazarin,
 and that if the Prince of 
Conde
 had forsaken their 
Interest,
 their good 
Fortune
 and 
Reputation
 had been at an end? nevertheless when we obser∣ved, that we had lost the Assistance of that Prince, who was return'd to his Duty by the 
Pyrenaean
 Peace, and that 
France
 to the prejudice of a League so sacredly ratify'd, forbore not however, not only to foment the 
Troubles
 of 
Portugal,
 but also to send considerable Supplys to their assistance at several times; I say, when we saw, that the 
Peace
 was

 no more than a Cloak for 
France
's Ambition, have we not suffer'd the Oppression of our Neighbours, without so much as opening our Lips, as if 
True Policy
 had not taught us, that it was time to oppose the 
Designs
 of a 
Nation,
 which would never be contented, 'till she had satisfy'd her 
Ambition
 by the 
Conquest
 of the World?


Nevertheless, with what confi∣dence, if I may not call it Impu∣dence, did she maintain, that she acted nothing but what was confor∣mable to the Peace? Did not she likewise insinuate, that whatever was done in the behalf of 
Portugal,
 was done without her Order? To which purpose while she covertly sent Supplys of Men and Money into that Kingdom, she publish'd

 her strictest Prohibitions to prevent the 
Transportation
 of 
Arms
 thither, yet underhand encourag'd her Sub∣jects to carry supplys to that 
Crown,
 as the only means to purchase E∣steem and Reputation; yet all this while carry'd fair with the 
Embassa∣dor,
 who made loud complaints of these Breaches, especially when he saw that the Marquiss of 
Beauveau
 had permission to levy a Regiment of 
Cavalry
 for the Service of that 
Crown
 in the 
Metropolis
 of 
France,
 just under his Nose; after he had Arti∣cl'd to outward appearance with the 
Portugal
 Embassador, but in re∣ality with the 
Court
 of 
France.
 After all which proceedings she would needs have it, that whatever the 
Spanish
 Embassador said, was but the effect of his Fancy and Imagi∣nation;

 as now at this very time she would make us believe that she has no Design to make a War, tho she has eaten up a 
Country
 within these few Months, to which she has no Right at all, and to which she has not the least of Lawful Pre∣tences, if 
Reason
 and 
Justice
 were the Rule of her Actions.


All this while, though we have observ'd all along these Practises of 
France,
 without the least opposition, yet neither do we make any ad∣vantage of them at this day, that we see our selves just ready to be made the 
Unfortunate Victims
 of Her 
Ambition.
 'Tis true I know there are several who will reply that 
Suc∣cours
 have been sent to the 
Spaniards,
 which if it were done, we are be∣holding to the Prince of 
Orange,
 who

 having a deeper 
Fore-sight
 than o∣thers, could not suffer us to be over∣whelm'd, without doing at least what was his 
Duty
 to do; which is the reason we find him so firmly bent against the 
Persecutions
 and 
In∣juries
 of 
France,
 which esteems not Vertue, but when it agrees with Her Interest.


But to return to the business, I say that 
France
 endeavour'd to blear the Eyes of the 
Spanish Embassador,
 who had in mind however to hunt the wrong Deer, when an unex∣pected 
Accident
 made her act with more 
boldness,
 and forbear any lon∣ger to disguise her Thoughts. She had treated with 
Montgeorges,
 who was slain in the late Wars, and who was then a Captain in 
Candale,
 a stout Soldier, and one who lov'd War a¦bove

 all things, to carry a Supply of Officers and Soldiers into 
Portugal:
 Now 
Montgeorges,
 being embark'd with his 
Company,
 and upon his Voy∣age into 
Portugal,
 happen'd to be taken by the 
Spaniards,
 which were advertis'd of his 
Departure;
 upon which there was a necessity for 
France
 to take off her Mask; for that the 
Spaniards
 began already to talk of cutting off 
Montgeorges
's Head.


This apparent 
Act
 of 
Infidelity
 vvas attended by several others, and yet no 
Neighbouring Puissance
 in∣terpos'd it's 
Authority,
 to the end these things might be regulated ac∣cording to 
Justice:
 Not but that there vvas 
Warranty
 for the 
Pyrenaean Peace;
 as vvell as there are novv for the Peace of 
Nimeghen,
 but that

 they are such, vvho after the 
Con∣clusion
 of the 
Treaty,
 never mind aftervvards the 
Breaches
 vvhich are made of it, so that there is not one at this time takes any care to send a∣ny succour to the 
Spaniards,
 vvhose 
Ruine
 is attempted by so many in∣direct means. On the other side, the 
Spaniards,
 vvhether they are be∣come insensible, or vvhich is most probable, that they understand their ovvn 
weakness,
 are contended to see themselves so rudely handl'd vvith∣out testifying the least 
Resentment,
 but only by 
Complaints,
 altogether misbecoming 
Soveraign Princes,
 es∣pecially if not prosecuted vvith ef∣fectual Deeds; so that others seeing them so patiently svvallovv all 
Affronts,
 did not think themselves oblig'd to take their 
Part.




Which 
Weakness
 of theirs vvas certainly most apparent upon the Occasion of an 
Accident
 that hap∣ned in 
London
 betvveen Monsieur 
d'Estrades
 and Monsieur 
de Vataville Embassadors
 of both 
Crowns:
 For after the Baron of 
Vataville
 had got the 
Precedence
 before Monsieur 
d'E∣strades,
 upon the Entry of another 
Embassador; Spain
 did not only dis∣claim and disavovv the 
Act,
 but al∣so has for ever stain'd her 
Reputati∣on,
 by an 
Ignominious Declaration,
 vvhich I dare not repeat, and vvhich I cannot remember with∣out blushing out of my 
Respect
 and 
Love
 to the Nation. However if the thing be call'd to mind, we ought to lay the Fault upon those other 
Potentates,
 that shewed them∣selves so passionately earnest for the

 Peace, that they never laid to heart the 
Affront
 which was offer'd to 
Spain,
 who seeing her self aban∣don'd by all the World, was forc'd to abate of her wonted Haughti∣ness.


Nevertheless the more notable 
Head-pieces,
 perceiving how proud∣ly 
France
 behav'd her self upon that occasion were of opinion, that it was necessary to withstand Her 
Ambition
 before the further Encrease of her Strength and Power: But the Councel of these prudent 
Poli∣ticians
 was listen'd to by way of 
Discourse
 only, and the Seizure of 
Blindness
 began to be so general, that they look'd upon those who dis∣cours'd at that rate, as Persons that rather sought to disturb than pre∣serve the Peace so necessary for all 
Europe.




Nor did they begin to unhood∣wink their Eyes; till 
France,
 no lon∣ger able to continue quiet, resolv'd to carry the War into 
Flanders
 under 
Pretences
 altogether as 
Chymerical
 as those at present; But with an 
Ad∣vocate
 of 
Paris,
 such a one as they vvere careful to chuse out of the sharpest witted of the 
Chiurme,
 un∣dertook to beautifie with a specious varnish, an 
Undertaking,
 which a 
Person
 of 
Honesty
 and 
Integrity
 would have been very much troubl'd to perform; only he who had serv'd his 
Apprentiship
 at the 
Pettie Bar,
 where for 
Two Crowns,
 they will defend the wickedest 
Injustice
 in the World, was of Opinion, that be∣ing much better 
feed
 than so, it did not become him to neglect so fare an Opportunity for his 
Preferment:


 So that 
Interest
 prevailing above 
Truth,
 in a short time there came forth a 
Manifesto,
 wherein they en∣deavour'd to maintain, that though the King by the 
Pyrenaean
 Treaty had renounc'd all manner of 
Pretences
 which he might hereafter have to the 
Low Countries
 or 
Netherlands,
 in right of his Wife, that 
Renunciati∣on
 was invalid, because the 
Parlia∣ment
 had never confirm'd the 
Ar∣ticles.


The same 
Manifesto
 endeavour'd further to prove, that the 
Queen
 had a 
Right
 to several 
Provinces;
 and therefore to give the 
Manifesto
 a Ti∣tle proper to what they went a∣bout to make out, it was Entitul'd 
The Rights of the Queen.
 For you must understand, that it was the King himself, who had hindr'd the

 
Pyrenaean
 Treaty from being Regi∣stred in 
Parliament,
 to the end that for the future it might serve for a 
Pretence
 against what had been 
sign'd
 by Himself, and the chiefest 
Nobi∣lity
 of 
France.


Which piece of Litigious Craft when it gave occasion to all the World to reflect upon the 
Small Faith
 and 
Sincerity
 of the 
French
 King, Men vvere surpriz'd with wonder, That so great a Prince, who affe∣cted the Title of most 
Christian King
 should commit such Violences as would make 
Infidels
 to blush; and took pleasure to recount his 
Actions,
 that by comparing the one with the other, the disadvantage might the better appear on the Kings side. The general question was, whether a man were not oblig'd to keep his

 Word which he had so solemnly sworn upon the Gospels, confirm'd by so Great and Near an 
Alliance,
 and where there was nothing omit∣ted to render inviolable by all the most considerable 
Acts
 that could be performed? And then the que∣stion was whether there were any thing that could disoblige a Man from an Oath so solemn? to which the 
General
 Answer was, that it was an 
Action
 dreaded by Men, and which call'd for the just 
Vengeance
 of God.


And indeed there needs no grea∣ter Skill in 
Theology
 to understand, that 
Christianity
 and the 
Church,
 which is the same Thing, sufficiently tea∣ches us, that we are to keep our Words, not only to a 
Father-in-Law,
 as this occasion requir'd, but also to

 a 
Turk.
 There is a notable 
Exam∣ple
 of this in the Person of a 
French
 Gentleman of the Family of 
An∣glure,
 from whence there are seve∣ral who derive their Descent that live in great splendor to this day. The particular History of this Fa∣mily relates, that one of their An∣cestors being taken in Fight by 
So∣ladin, Sultan
 of 
Egypt,
 was set at Li∣berty after a long Imprisonment, upon condition that he should re∣turn himself in Person with the 
Ransom
 which the 
Soladin
 had laid upon his Head; the 
Gentleman
 com∣ing home, and having sold part of his 
Estate
 to make good his 
Word,
 return'd back to 
Soladin,
 and told him he had brought his 
Ransom in Person
 according to his own 
Agree∣ment
 and 
Conditions,
 and that if he

 pleas'd to name any 
Person
 to re∣ceive it he vvould presently tell it out. 
Soladin,
 vvho never thought a∣ny more of him, but believ'd, that since he had let him go, he should never see him again, vvas so surpriz'd at his 
Generosity,
 that after he had embrac'd and caress'd him vvith all imaginable 
Endearment,
 he told him, that from thence for∣ward he should have a greater re∣spect for the 
Christians
 than ever he had; and thereupon he did not on∣ly 
release
 him of his 
Ransom,
 but or∣dered his 
Treasurer
 to give him 
Ten Thousand Franks,
 which vvas a great Sum in those days. He fur∣ther desir'd his 
Friendship,
 and that alvvays the 
Eldest
 of his 
Family
 might be called 
Saladin,
 to the end that if Posterity should be curious

 to know why they bore a 
Name
 so extraordinary among the 
Christians,
 they might be inform'd at the same time of the Occasion: Which 
Re∣quest
 of 
Soladin
 has been observ'd e∣ver since; insomuch that the Count 
Destoges,
 the Eldest of the 
Family,
 is this day nam'd 
Soladin.


If I might be permitted to make 
Reflexions
 upon this 
Story,
 I could without difficulty prove, that the 
present
 is far different from the 
Ages past.
 Formerly they kept their 
word
 with 
Turks,
 now adays, a most 
Chri∣stian King
 will not keep his 
Faith
 with his 
Father-in-Law.
 At this day the 
Descendants
 from a 
Christian
 Race are 
Christened Saladine;
 because their 
Ancestor
 so promis'd to the 
Turk.
 At this present a 
most Christian King
 nei∣ther minds the word, which his 
An∣cestors


 have past to their 
Subjects
 of the 
Reformed Religion,
 nor the 
Pro∣mises
 which he has made himself: At this day the Family of 
Anglure,
 which is only a private 
Gentleman's,
 derives all it's Honour from the 
No∣ble Act
 of one of its 
Ancestors,
 who made good his profligated 
Faith
 to the 
Turk;
 but the House of 
France,
 the most renowned in the World, for the 
Breach
 of an 
Infinite Num∣ber
 of the 
Edicts,
 granted in favour of the 
Christians.


But to return to our Subject, the King of 
France,
 grounding his 
Claims
 upon 
Imaginary Pretences,
 and upon a 
Nicety,
 that the 
Parliament
 had not ratify'd the 
Pyrenaean
 Treaty, resol∣ved to break the 
Peace,
 and carry his Arms into 
Flanders.
 But here before I go any further give me

 leave to tell the World, what the Authority of this 
Parliament
 is, to prevent the Mistake of those, who may think it equal in 
Power
 to the 
Parliament
 of 
England.
 You are then to understand that the slightest Or∣der of 
Council
 cancels all 
Edicts
 of 
Parliament,
 the 
Power
 of which is so limited at this day, that though it take 
Cognizance
 only of private and particular 
Interests,
 the 
Council
 sends for the 
Cause
 before themselves and laughs at all that the 
Parliament
 has done in the same Case. Former∣ly nevertheless it's Authority was very great, nor was it long ago, that it was grown to that height, that every one admired at it; I mean during the Minority of the King: But there is such an 
Alteration
 since that time, that there is little notice taken of the 
Parliament.




And indeed at that very time, when the forementioned 
Manifesto
 appear'd, the King took away all their Privileges, banished all those that were suspected to have any affection for the 
publick Interest,
 and in a word, contemned it so far that he never went thither, but in his 
Ri∣ding Boots
 and his 
Cane
 in his Hand. He also deprived it of its very Name, as he serv'd the rest of the 
Tribunals:
 For to make it appear, that there were no more Masters but himself, he set forth an 
Edict,
 That neither the 
Parliament
 nor the 
Grand Councel,
 nor the 
Chamber of Accompts,
 nor the 
Court of Aydes
 should be called by any other Ti∣tle than that of 
Superiour,
 whereas before they were call'd 
Soveraign Courts.
 He also put forth another

 
Edict,
 which savoured in my opi∣nion of much more wrong and In∣justice: For whereas, when any new Imposition was thought upon and laid upon the People, or any o∣ther Innovation was imposed upon the Government, the King was wont to go in Person to see those 
Edicts
 ratifyed; the 
Parliament
 is now obliged to make the 
Ratificati∣on
 upon a bare 
Letter
 under the Privy Signet, many times carryed by a Footman; So that this great 
Tribu∣nal
 formerly erected to be a 
Media∣tor
 between the King and the Peo∣ple, and to preserve the one from the 
Tyranny
 of the other, is now it self enforced to bow and crouch to the 
Kings Will:
 For now they dare not make those Remonstrances, which formerly they did, nor plead

 as before in behalf of the 
People.
 Or if they are permitted to make any 
Addresses
 of that Nature, they must be full of 
Flattery
 and 
Dissimulation;
 and as some Parents humble their Children to kiss the Rod after Cor∣rection; so it behoves the People, who are the Kings Children, or should be so at least, to thank the King by the Mouths of their 
Magi∣strates,
 for all the Taxes and hea∣vy Impositions, which he lays up∣on them to satisfy his profusion.


Upon this 
Authority,
 which the 
Parliament
 has in the Kingdom it was, That the King laid the Foun∣dation of an approaching War. In a Word, the King of 
Spain
 was not sooner dead, but presently there appeared a small 
Pamphlet,
 under the Title of 
The Rights of the Queen,
 by









 which they endeavoured to prove, that the Renunciation of all Claims which the King had made by the 
Pyrenaean
 Treaty was utterly void, because it was never verifyed by the 
Parliament.
 And yet if the 
Renun∣ciation
 had been good, which they did not much matter to dispute, it could not have been long in force, by reason that the 
Dauphin
 had not ratifyed the Treaty, who might pretend a greater Interest as being his 
Mothers
 Heir. In truth, this 
Pam∣phlet
 was nothing but a Composure of Words well put together, con∣teining very little or no reason. For to begin with the first, true it is, That the 
Parliament
 were wont to ratify the most remarkable Acts of the 
Kingdom,
 but that such a 
Ratifi∣cation
 was absolutely Essential is

 that which we deny, and which I shall endeavour to prove: For Ex∣ample, if the King happens to marry with any 
Foreign
 Princess, the 
Parliament
 has nothing to do with the 
Contract:
 Nor do we find, that the 
Parliament
 had any knowledg of that between 
H.
 4. and 
Marie Medi∣ci;
 or which is still fresh in 
Memory,
 of the 
Marriage
 between the 
Dau∣phin
 and 
Madam
 the 
Dauphiness.
 And yet the 
Affairs
 transacted were as important, as perhaps the Kings 
Renunciation
 made by the 
Pyrenaean
 Treaty: But some perhaps will ob∣ject, That the Case is far different; For in a 
Treaty
 of Peace is stated and handled the Establishment of the Peoples Peace; whereas in a Trea∣ty of 
Marriage
 there is nothing transacted, but the Concern of two

 
Persons.
 I confess the reason seems plausible but easie to refute: For if it be in respect of the Peoples In∣terest that a Treaty of Peace ought to be ratifyed by the 
Parliament,
 why are not the 
Treaties
 of 
War
 ratifyed in the same manner? They will have a Treaty which exterminates War, and restores Peace to a King∣dom, instead of Trouble and Con∣fusion that Reigned there before, to be subject to a 
Parliamentary
 Ratifi∣cation; but they will not have a Treaty of 
War,
 that banishes Peace, and brings in Disorder and Confu∣sion to be ratifyed by 
Parliament,
 which nevertheless was instituted to no other end than the Preservation of the People. Let us rather say, that the Custom of verifying 
Trea∣ties
 of Peace in this manner was not

 introduced, till after it was ordain∣ed, that all the Royal Benevolences should be ratifyed in 
Parliament,
 and that such as were not so verifyed, should be of no value, which was done to prevent Princes who are generally prone to profuse Libera∣lity, from giving away all their Pa∣trimony, and being afterwards ob∣lig'd, for want of Money to vex the People. Let us grant then say I, that the Parliament, setting that by some Treaties of Peace, consi∣derable Alienations were made from the Crown, chiefly under 
John
 the 
First,
 to free himself out of the hands of the 
English;
 and af∣terwards under 
Francis
 the 
First,
 to deliver himself out of the hands of the 
Spaniards,
 had Authority given them to verify Treaties of Peace,

 to prevent the Distipation of the Crown Revenues. But their Au∣thority is yet greater, when it shall be a Law received in 
France,
 that the Parliament may vacate Treaties which are not verifyed, that is to say, if the Treaties were not made in due Form, or were found preju∣dicial to the People.


But it cannot be said, that 
France
 receiv'd any prejudice by the 
Pyre∣naean
 Treaty, or that the Treaty was not concluded with all the u∣sual Formalities. In respect of 
For∣malities
 there were so many observ'd as took up much more time than was necessary for the Repose of the People, who after so tedious a War, thirsted after nothing so much as Peace; nor was it enough that 
De Lionne
 and 
Pimentell
 set their

 hands to the Treaty, but to render it more solemn; Cardinal 
Mazarine
 and 
Lewis de Haro,
 the Principal Ministers of both Crowns, were oblig'd to sign it also, so that we may say that it was the most 
Authentick Treaty
 that had been con∣cluded in a long time before. Be∣sides, they had observ'd all the Cir∣cumstances imaginable, insomuch that the place appointed for the Conferences, was neither in 
France
 nor in 
Spain,
 which nevertheless is very remarkable: For that then they were willing, that 
Spain
 should go cheek by jowle with 
France;
 yet afterwards they would not allow that the 
Treaty
 had been ratify'd: But that which seemed to put the Treaty not only out of the King's but out of the reach of all 
France


 to do it Injury was that the chiefest of the 
Clergy
 and 
Nobility
 had sign'd the 
Contract
 of 
Marriage
 between the King and the 
Infanta,
 wherein the aforesaid 
Renunciation
 was con∣tain'd. So that it was an idle thing to say that the 
Parliament,
 which at most does but represent the Or∣ders or Estates of the Kingdom would not approve a Treaty, which was already approv'd by the 
King,
 the 
Clergy
 and the 
Nobili∣ty.


Now that this 
Treaty
 brought no prejudice to 
France
 is as easie to prove: For though 
France
 at that time had a great advantage over 
Spain,
 we must consider neverthe∣less, that this advantage might one day turn against it self, as being ob∣lig'd to share it's 
Conquests
 with 
Eng∣land,


 then in 
Alliance
 with her. Now not to mention in the least what are the dangerous 
Consequences
 that I could draw from such a 
Partition,
 it shall suffice to say, That the 
Interest
 of 
France
 was not to let the 
English
 get Footing in 
Flanders,
 who were an Enemy much more dangerous than the 
Spaniard.
 Besides, 
France
 by that Treaty had made sure of the greatest part of Her 
Conquests,
 and had changed into a certain 
Right
 the 
Right
 of 
Nations,
 which was a 
Right
 subject to several 
Chances
 of 
Fortune;
 and then to object that the 
Dauphin
 had not ratify'd the Queens 
Renunciation
 is an Objection so weak that it does not deserve an 
Answer:
 For I wouln fain know, whether a 
Father
 and a 
Mother
 do not bind their 
Issue
 when they sign a 
Contract?
 And

 whether the 
Dauphin
 had more 
right
 to question that which the 
King
 and 
Queen
 had sign'd, than they who live under the same Laws and the same 
Monarchy.


All these 
Considerations
 give us plainly to see that whatever of 
Right
 belonging to the Queen was in the 
Treaty,
 was only to amuse the 
Common People,
 and particularly those of 
Flanders,
 who being per∣swaded that the 
Queen
 had a 
Right
 to the 
Netherlands,
 were in a capa∣city to foment a 
Rebellion,
 to which they might be provok'd by the ill 
Usage
 of the 
Spanish Soldiery,
 who for want of 
Pay,
 commit many 
Vio∣lences
 and 
Disorders.
 It being there∣fore a great piece of 
Prudence
 to prevent all Trouble that might a∣rise from thence, the Baron of 
Iso∣la,


 one of the Ministers of the House of 
Austria,
 put Pen to Pa∣per, to shew the Vanity of the Consequences, which the preten∣ded Author of the 
Treatise
 drew from the 
Right
 of the 
Queen.
 Of which a great number of 
Copies
 were sent into 
Flanders, Germany
 and the 
Neighbouring Parts;
 some were also conveyed into 
France;
 but the Court resolving that the People should make it's 
Ambition
 an 
Article
 of their 
Faith,
 made such an exact 
Enquiry
 after the 
Publishers
 that two or three were committed to the 
Ba∣stile,
 and were in great danger of their Lives. For as it was not law∣ful in that Kingdom to write 
Truth,
 either in 
Religion
 or 
Politicks,
 neither was it permitted to be spoken or taught to any one whatsoever. And

 therefore as well they who bought the 
Book,
 as they who published these 
Books
 were oblig'd to keep out of the way, as if they had been 
Malefactors.
 But the more they thought to restrain the Peoples Wills, the more the People endea∣vour'd to set their minds at Liber∣ty, so that many honest Folks made it their business to content their 
Cu∣riosity,
 in spight of all the 
publick Prohibitions.


By vertue of these 
Imaginary Pre∣tensions
 the King fail'd not to send to the 
Governour
 of the 
Netherlands
 to surrender into his hands those 
places,
 which, as he pretended, belong'd to the 
Queen.
 And because he could not choose but know, that the 
Go∣vernour
 would no way answer his 
Expectations,
 he follow'd the 
Mes∣senger


 with a puissant 
Army,
 to make himself the Master of them by force; thereupon, having received the 
Go∣vernors
 Answer, that the 
King
 his Master would fairly part with no∣thing, he enter'd 
Flanders,
 took 
Char∣leroy, Aeth, Courtray, Audenard
 and 
Lisle,
 while the Marshal 
D'Aumont
 with another Army attack'd the 
Cities
 and 
Towns
 that lay nearer the Sea.


These 
Conquests
 carried on with such a 
rapid Success,
 astonish'd the 
Neighbouring States,
 who thought it their 
Interest
 to stop these 
violent Pro∣ceedings;
 especially the 
Low Countries,
 who by no means liked the near 
Ap∣proach
 of so formidable and ambi∣tious a 
Neighbour:
 Therefore they engaged the King of 
England
 to en∣ter into a League, wherein the King

 of 
Swedeland
 also joyn'd, by which they obliged themselves all three, to make the 
French
 and 
Spaniard
 lay down their Arms, with a Resolu∣tion to declare a War against the obstinate Refuser.


This 
League
 was call'd the 
Triple Alliance,
 afterwards so fatal to 
Hol∣land,
 as I shall relate in due Place, that it may be thought they had reason enough to repent their Ne∣gotiation. They say it was a Per∣son of 
Rochel,
 who laid the first Foundations of it, after he had made those 
Powerful Princes
 deeply sensi∣ble, how little the 
Ambition
 of 
France
 was to be trusted; however it were, 
France,
 who seldom easily pardons those that have once offen∣ded her, well knowing that the same Person was in 
Switzerland,
 la∣bouring

 to insinuate the same Opi∣nion among the 
Cantons,
 sent thi∣ther the two 
Platells,
 of which the Eldest was a Captain of Horse, the other Esquire to 
Monsieur Turenne,
 to apprehend him. It had been a knot∣ty 
Enterprize
 and of dangerous con∣sequence for the 
Platells,
 had their 
Errand
 been discovered in 
Switzer∣land.
 But being so cunning as to car∣ry their business private, and to sur∣prize the Person, as he passed from one City to another, they carry'd him into 
France,
 where he was bro∣ken alive upon the Wheel, after he had endeavour'd to escape the Tor∣ments of his Execution, by an A∣ction more resolute than 
Christian-like:
 For having found in the hole of the 
Prison,
 where he lay a piece of 
Glass,
 he cut off his 
Privy Mem∣bers,


 and hid them under the Bed, that the 
Jaylor
 might not know what he had done: but in regard he could not stanch the blood so well but that some drops would fall from the wound, besides that his Colour plainly shewed that something more than ordinary ailed him, the Jaylor would see whence the Blood came: So that after a short search having found, what was hidden under the Bed, all in a puddle of Blood; he went and gave the 
Jud∣ges
 notice of it, who being resolv'd to make him a publick 
Example
 ha∣sten'd to give Sentence. Thereupon they condemn'd him to be broken upon the Wheel, and fearing he might not have strength enough to be carry'd to the common place of Execution, or that he might dye,

 if they delay'd till the Afternoon, Order was given for the immedi∣ate Erecting of a Scaffold before the 
Prison-door,
 and for his speedy 
Execution.


The 
Triple Alliance,
 which 
France
 did not foresee, astonish'd her so, that altho she had promis'd her self the 
Conquest
 of the greatest Part of all 
Flanders,
 she was oblig'd never∣theless to lay down her 
Arms;
 not but then she had an 
Army
 on foot of above a 
Hundred Thousand Men,
 but in regard that 
England
 and 
Holland
 made great 
Preparations
 by 
Sea,
 and that she had no 
Fleet
 was able to re∣sist two such 
potent Enemies,
 she was afraid, least the 
English
 and 
Hol∣landers,
 while her 
Forces
 were im∣ployed in 
Flanders,
 might land either in 
Normandy
 or 
Britainy,
 and strike

 a panick Terror into the heart of his 
Kingdom.


France
 having thus made a 
Peace,
 as it were by 
Constraint,
 she plotted nothing more, than to revenge her self upon those, who had contri∣buted most effectually toward it. Now it being apparent that the 
U∣nited Provinces
 had been most active upon that occasion, and that all 
Eu∣rope
 owed the 
Peace
 which it enjoy'd to 
Them,
 it was their 
Lot
 to feel the weight of his 
Fury;
 yet was she careful to watch her 
Opportunity
 be∣fore she brake forth into an open 
Blaze
 of 
Revenge:
 For 
Holland
 be∣ing as yet in League with 
England
 and 
Swedland,
 therefore there must be a way found out to divide her from two such 
Potent Friends,
 who being 
United
 were still sufficiently

 powerful to disappoint all the 
French
 Designs: Which as 
France
 had still watch'd to bring to pass, it was not long before an Opportunity offer'd it self, by reason of an unhappy 
difference
 between the 
English
 and 
Dutch
 about 
Trade.
 Nor did 
France
 then take any care as she had for∣merly done, to offer her Mediati∣on, to close up the breach between the 
Two Nations,
 but on the contra∣ry used all means to incense the King of 
England,
 yet underhand set on foot a 
Treaty
 with the 
Hollan∣ders,
 least they should have any thoughts of making 
Peace
 with 
Great Britain.
 The 
Hollanders,
 who had often prov'd the good Effects of the 
French
 Succours, when they had any quarrel with 
England,
 be∣liev'd they would be still as effectu∣al;

 depending upon the 
King
 of 
France,
 who ceased not to amuse 'em with daily hopes: But while they were thus as they thought, upon a conclusion with Him, to oppose the King of 
England,
 who was making powerful 
Preparations
 a∣gainst 'em by 
Sea,
 they were not a little surpriz'd to find that the two 
Princes
 were joyn'd both together, and that while the 
English
 attack'd 'em by 
Sea,
 the 
French
 were to fall upon them by Land, and that with a Force so numerous and dreadful, that the Memory of 
History
 had not Parallel'd the like out of 
France
 in a long time: And then it was that the 
United Provinces
 found them∣selves in a strange 
Disorder;
 for tho they wanted neither 
Ships,
 nor 
Mo∣ney,
 yet had they not an 
Army
 suf∣ficient

 to oppose the King of 
France
 who had brought his Forces alrea∣dy into the 
Country
 about 
Cologne,
 from whence he intended to make the Attack.


In the midst of these 
Troubles
 to levy Men in 
Holland,
 was look'd upon as a Remedy that would but little avail; when Peace enjoy'd for so many years had render'd the 
People
 more fit for 
Trade
 than 
War;
 raw 
Souldiers
 not being proper to make resistance against inur'd and hardy 
veterans:
 Therefore the 
Hol∣landers
 sent into 
Germany
 to raise 
For∣ces,
 and to treat with those 
Princes
 from whom they expected aid; but all 
Europe
 was so astonish'd at the prodigious 
Army
 and 
Preparations
 of 
France,
 that every one kept his own Force at home, out of a Jealousie,

 least 
France,
 under a pretence of as∣sailing the 
Low Countries,
 should break into 
Germany.


The 
Hollanders
 at that time had no more than 
Five and Twenty Thou∣sand Men;
 for tho they had given out 
Commissions
 to all that proffered their Service, yet they could rec∣kon upon none but those that were drawn down to the general 
Rende∣vouze.
 But that which yet enfeebl'd their 
Condition
 the more was, that 
De Wit,
 the 
Pensionary
 of 
Holland,
 had always kept the Prince of 
Orange
 at a distance from the Management of 
Affairs;
 and therefore being a better 
Politician
 than 
Souldier,
 yet one who would have a hand in every thing, the main business was car∣ried with much 
Disorder
 and 
Confu∣sion.
 There was also one thing more

 which very much contributed to the 
Ruin
 of the 
State,
 tho at that time not discovered, which was that the King of 
France
 had Intelli∣gence of every thing that was act∣ed in the Country by means of 
Mombas,
 then in the Service of the 
Republic,
 which had given him a considerable 
Command
 in the 
Army:
 He was a 
Frenchman
 born, so that he was easily gain'd to the King, by the 
Industry
 of 
Des Roches
 Captain of the Prince of 
Conde
's Guards, and his near 
Relation,
 and who had prevail'd with him to take a Jour∣ney into 
France
 the Winter before, where he had been discoursed with by 
Monsieur
 the 
Prince.


This Conjuncture of 
Accidents
 had been sufficient to have utterly ruined the 
State,
 according to hu∣mane

 probability, had not God determin'd the contrary. At what time, the King of 
France
 being rea∣dy to enter the Country, the 
States
 assembled together to consider of the best way for the 
Defence
 of their 
Dominions:
 Monsieur the 
Prince
 of 
Orange,
 who maugre all the shuf∣fling and juggling of 
De Wit,
 was chosen 
Captain General
 for the 
States,
 advis'd the quitting of all the Pla∣ces above the 
Rhine,
 to put in 
Ten Thousand
 Souldiers into 
Maestrick,
 and to encamp with the rest at 
Bode∣grave,
 as being a most advantage∣ous Post to secure 
Holland.
 Monsieur 
D' Opdam
 and 
Celidrek,
 who spake in the behalf of the Nobility, were of the same Opinion; but the rest being of a contrary 
Judgmeni,
 it was resol∣ved that they should hold all the se∣veral

 Places beyond the 
Rhine,
 which nevertheless they very much weaken'd by draining those Garri∣sons to supply 
Maestrick.


In the mean while, the King ha∣ving lain for some time before 
Charleroy,
 march'd in view of 
Maes∣trick,
 and stay'd some 
Twelve
 or 
Fifteen
 Days before 
Wise,
 a small Town in the Territory of 
Liege,
 in∣to which he clapt a 
Garrison;
 there having received 
Intelligence
 from 
Mombas,
 that all the Towns above the 
Rhine
 were slenderly mann'd, and almost naked of Defence, he pass'd the 
Meuse
 at 
Wise,
 and after he had beaten off certain Troops that were advantageously posted, he sate down before 
Orsoy
 with a for∣mal 
Siege.
 The 
Governor
 wanted no Courage, but in regard the 
Town


 was neither strong of it self, nor sufficiently 
Garrisoned,
 he surren∣dred his 
Charge
 the day following. The 
French
 plunder'd the 
Town,
 and hang'd up all those of their own Nation that they found in Arms, and among the rest one Man that was 
Threescore
 and 
six
 years of 
Age,
 who was the chief Canonier in 
Or∣soy.
 From thence the Army mar∣ched to 
Rhineberg,
 which 
Dossery
 surrendr'd without striking a stroak. For which not long after the Prince of 
Orange
 caus'd his Head to be se∣ver'd from his Shoulders. Nor did the Governor of 
Wesel
 make a Re∣sistance much more to his Honour; though the Place was able to have sustained a long 
Siege,
 who surren∣dred it to the Prince of 
Conde
 after and Entrenchment of two or three

 days. Whose 
Punishment
 therefore though not so severe as 
Dossory
's, was something like it: For the Hangman skimm'd his Sword o∣ver his Head, but spar'd him his Ig∣nominious Life. 
Buric
 was at the same time taken by Marshel 
Tu∣renne.
 After which the Prince of 
Conde
 advanc'd into the Country, and took in 
Deudetrom, Rees
 and 
E∣meric
 with the same 
Ease
 that he ma∣ster'd other Places.


These Victories though they cost but little Blood, gave the King of 
France
 the Reputation of a 
Caesar
 in his Army. For they saw that he might say like Him, 
I came, I viewed and vanquished,
 Therefore to uphold the Glory he had won, he resolved to pass the 
Rhine,
 as formerly that 
Emperor
 had done; but he would

 pass it after a more Noble and He∣roick Manner: For 
Caesar
 had pass'd it by the means of a 
Bridge,
 but he was resolv'd to swim it over.


Two Gentlemen of the 
Country,
 Neighbors to 
Tholus,
 whose Names I cannot well remember, came to the Prince of 
Conde
 at 
Emeric,
 and offer'd to shew him a 
Place,
 where he had but an hundred 
Paces
 to swim. He gladly accepted their Of∣fer, which made the 
French
 now look upon themselves at the End of their 
Conquests,
 in regard the 
Issel
 stopped their Entrance into the 
Country,
 not only because of its depth, but also by reason the Ene∣my lay strongly entrench'd on the other side of the 
River.
 Thereupon the Prince of 
Conde,
 having high∣ly caresses'd the two 
Gentlemen,
 and

 promising them large 
Reward's
 commanded the Count 
de Guiche
 to go along with them, to try whe∣ther or no he might confide in what they had said; immediately they carried the Count right against 
Tho∣lus,
 and throwing themselves first into the Water, the Count follow∣ed with his Squire, while his 
Par∣ty
 stayed behind by the 
River
 side: Upon this 
Tryal
 finding that the Gentlemen had spoken nothing but what was 
Truth,
 the Count return∣ed and made his 
Report
 to the 
Prince,
 who sent the 
King
 an Account of what had happened, adding withal, if he pleased to take the 
Honour
 of the 
Enterprize
 upon himself, how ea∣sie it would be for him to surprize the 
Enemy,
 who little mistrusted a∣ny such 
Discovery,
 and minded no∣thing

 but to guard the 
Issel.
 The 
King
 eager in the 
Chase
 of so much 
Honour,
 flew to the 
Prince
 of 
Conde
's Camp, and after he had supped with him, marched all night along the 
Bank
 of the 
Rhine,
 and arrived at the Place about half an hour be∣fore day.


In the mean time the 
Prince
 of 
O∣range,
 who found more fidelity a∣mong the 
Meaner
 Sort than among the 
Nobility,
 being advertized by the 
Boors,
 who saw the 
French,
 when they sounded the 
Depth
 of the 
River,
 that the 
King
 had some 
Design
 on the other side, sent thither 
Mombas
 with the 
Cavalry
 and 
Infantry. Mom∣bas
 had already forfeited his 
Honour
 by keeping Correspondence with the Enemy, but tho this Opportu∣nity was no less favourable for him

 to continue his 
Treacherous
 Designs, was afraid, that for want of being known, he might run some hazard in the 
Conflict,
 bethought himself of writing to the 
Deputies
 of the 
States,
 who attended the Prince of 
Orange;
 and thereupon sent them a fair Sto∣ry that there was no Likelyhood, that the 
French
 had any Design to pass the River, and that therefore, if they thought good, he would put himself into 
Nimeghen,
 whither it was most probable that the 
French
 intended to march: He took his Time to send this Letter when the Prince was absent from the Camp with a 
Detachment;
 so that the 
De∣puties
 not having the least 
Mistrust
 of his 
Fidelity,
 and believing the Care of 
Nimeghen
 to be of greater Con∣sequence, sent him Orders to march

 thither. The Prince of 
Orange
 re∣turning to the Camp, was strangly surprized, to hear what 
Mombas
 had done, and being now confirmed by this last 
Action
 of his, in some for∣mer 
Suspitions
 he had of his being a 
Traitor,
 caused him to be 
Arrested.


Which done, he commanded 
Wortz
 a 
German,
 whom the 
Repu∣blick
 had taken into their 
Services
 to march with all speed to 
Tholus,
 with some Companies that were drawn out of the 
Army. Wortz
 did all he could to hasten his 
Entrenchments,
 and order'd the 
Cavalry
 to advance to the side of the 
River.
 Whither the 
King
 being also arriv'd, caused several Pieces of Canon to be brought and levell'd against 
Wortz
's Cavalry, who thereupon retired among the 
Trees
 that grew by the

 banks side. In the mean time the 
French
 threw themselves into the 
River,
 where they lost abundance of Men, who were swallowed up in a Gulf, which others observing took the advantage of the left hand and forded over like 
Cowes,
 one at the 
Tayl
 of the other.


Wortz
 his 
Cavalry
 beheld the E∣nemy passing the 
River,
 without so much as giving the least Ground, till they saw some of the 
French
 Horse that were passed the River, begin to Form themselves into a Body. And then indeed they pre∣sently drew out from among the Trees, but they were so far from endeavouring to repel the Enemy, who were retired back into the Wa∣ter, that they stopped at the River side, from whence they discharged

 a Volley of Shot, but at such a di∣stance, as did little or no Execution. Which 
Cowardise
 of theirs put Life into the 
French,
 who had they been vigorously pursued into the Water, would never have adventured to make head again, or to have made a stand till more assistance came to their Relief. So that as soon as they found themselves strong enough to march against the 
Dutch
 Horse, who still kept their Station without mo∣ving, they marched out of the Ri∣ver with their Swords in their hands and put the 
Dutch
 to flight. Thus 
Wortz
's Cavalry having fordidly gi∣ven ground, the 
French
 rallyed and grew stronger and stronger by the 
Addition
 of more Force; the 
French
 continually passing the River, some wading, others in 
Boats.




Mounsieur
 the Prince of 
Conde,
 also having put himself into a Boat with the Duke D' 
Angion,
 and several o∣ther great Personages of the Court, was got near the opposite Shore, when he perceived that 
Monsieur de Longueville,
 having thrown him∣self into the River, was very near drowning, so that he was forc'd to return back, to take him into the Boat; but then speedily recovering the other side, he was no sooner landed but he drew up his Forces into 
Battalia,
 to attack the Enemies Entrenchments. The 
Dutch Infantry
 seeing but little security in their slender Works, and on the other side having put all their confidence in their 
Cavalry,
 by which they saw themselves now totally abandoned, took more care to crave quarter,

 than to make any resistance, which Monsieur the Prince of 
Conde
 offe∣red them, crying out aloud to them to lay down their 
Arms:
 All this while the 
French
 advanced forward without so much as discharging a Gun on either side, so that the 
King
 of 
France,
 who saw all that passed, thought himself sure of a 
Victory
 that would cost no 
Blood:
 But Mon∣sieur 
de Longueville,
 who had been drinking hard at 
Emeric,
 advancing up to the 
Trenches,
 let fly a 
Pistol,
 so that the 
Hollanders,
 not a little asha∣med that they had forborn so long, and believing now there was no 
Quarter
 to be expected, returned in answer to the Dukes 
Pistol
 such a smart Volley, that many of the most considerable of the Enemy were fetched off their 
Horses.
 Mon∣sieur

 
Longueville
 who began the skir∣mish was killed outright, the Prince of 
Conde
 wounded, with many o∣thers too long to 
Catalogue.


The 
French
 at first astonished at this unexpected 
Accident,
 having re∣covered themselves from their 
Fears
 rallyed again and fell upon the 
In∣trenchments,
 where they found some 
Resistance;
 especially at a 
Barricado,
 where stood a grey haired Officer, but one who notwithstanding his Years, shewed a Courage becom∣ing the 
Prime
 of vigorous 
Youth;
 but at length being overlaid with num∣ber, the rest betook themselves to flight, without demanding 
Quar∣ter,
 which they thought would but be in vain.


The 
French
 having now no Ene∣my to fight, pillaged the 
Castle
 of

 
Tholus,
 and put the Island of 
Bet∣taw
 under 
Contribution.


Nor was this the only advantage which they gained by their Passage over the 
Rhine;
 for the 
Hollanders
 fearing least the Enemy should come upon their backs, forsoke the 
Issel,
 and retreated to 
Utrech,
 where the People would have 
Sacrificed Mombas
 to their Fury, upon whom they laid all the blame of what had happened: But Monsieur the 
Prince
 of 
Orange,
 though he knew he de∣served Death, but was willing to have him first examined, if not put to the Rack, to the end he might understand the depth of his Trea∣son, gave Order that he should be conveyed through a 
Postern,
 and hid in a 
Hay-loft,
 to preserve him from the Rage of the People. In the

 mean while the King in Person took the City of 
DOESBERGH,
 and Monsieur 
Turenne
 took in 
Ni∣meghen, Zuoll, Deventer, Graves, Arn∣heim,
 the Fort of 
Skink, Creveceur
 and several other Places.


Utrech
 also fell into the hands of the 
French,
 without the 
Constraint
 of a Siege: For while the King lay be∣fore 
Doesbergh,
 the 
Burgher-Masters
 of the Town carryed him the Keys, as if they had been afraid they should not have a new Master soon enough. Thereupon the 
Marquiss
 of 
Rochford,
 in good reputation at 
Court
 was sent thither to command in chief: But not having as yet much Experience in War, he omit∣ted to make himself Master of 
Mai∣dam
 which the 
Dutch
 had quitted; by the possession of which they had

 assured themselves of 
Amsterdam:
 For had they been 
Masters
 of 
Mai∣dam,
 it had been an easie thing to hinder any Vessels from going in or out from 
Amsterdam;
 for that they were to pass by 
Maidam,
 which they durst not have attempted, if the 
French
 had been Masters of it; which had been the way to have compell'd 
Amsterdam
 to have sur∣render'd of it self, as 
Utrech
 had done: Not but that if the King himself had appear'd before the Walls, they had certainly carryed him the 
Keys;
 in regard that such was the general Despair, that every one thought of nothing else but to save his own Family, not minding the publick Interest of their Coun∣try: So that without expecting a Summons from the King, they held

 a 
Councel
 in the City, and debated whether they should not go to meet the King, and beseech him to take as well the City as the Inha∣bitants into his Protection, and it was an 
even Lay,
 but that they had taken that 
Resolution,
 had not two 
Burghermasters,
 whose Memories ought to be Sacred to Posterity, and whose Names were 
Offte
 and 
Hassenar,
 encouraged the rest to pluck up good hearts, and ra∣ther to call the Sea to their 
Assistance
 which was a more certain remedy, when they should be reduced to the last 
Necessity
 than to receive the 
French.


After the King had taken the Ci∣ty of 
Doesbregh,
 he encamped be∣fore 
Zeist,
 two Leagues from 
U∣trech,
 where he was attended by the

 
States
 Embassadors with 
Propositions
 of 
Peace,
 but he being swell'd with the 
Suecess
 of his 
Arms,
 propoun∣ded such rigorous 
Conditions,
 that the 
Embassadors
 were forced to re∣turn without being able to accom∣plish their 
Desires.
 Nevertheless, when they arriv'd at the 
Hague,
 the 
States
 resolved to send them back again, for that their 
Affairs
 were then in such a desperate 
Condition,
 that they thought themselves hap∣py, that they could be thought to accept of any manner of 
Conditi∣ons.


There was yet another 
Difficulty
 in the 
Treaty;
 for that the King would conclude nothing without the King of 
England,
 who finding the 
Conjuncture
 favourable, was no less severe in his 
Demands.




The 
States
 Embassadors being returned to 
Zeist,
 and finding there the 
English
 Embassadors likewise, proposed a 
New Treaty,
 but very difficult to conclude: For besides that the 
French
 would not remit any thing of their 
former Pretensions,
 the 
English Proposals
 ran so high, that it had been the 
Ruine
 of the 
State
 to have agreed them. 
France
 deman∣ded a 
Medal
 every year, by way of 
Tribute,
 with all the 
Expences
 of the 
War,
 which amounted, according to their 
Accompts,
 to a prodigious 
Sum. England
 demanded 
Possession
 of the 
Indits,
 and so many other things which appertained to the 
Republick,
 so that the 
States
 had as good have abandoned all, as to conclude a Treaty so disadvanta∣geous. The 
States
 being advized of these

 things by their Embassadors, who were returned from 
Zeist,
 resolv'd to break down their 
Dams,
 which was their last 
Remedy
 upon the ut∣most pinch of 
Necessity:
 But that which made them take this 
Resolu∣tion
 so much the sooner, was this, that the People, laying all the blame of their Misfortunes upon those who managed the publick 
Affairs,
 had massacred the 
Pensionary
 of 
Hol∣land
 together with his Brother, ho∣ping that the Face of 
Affairs
 would change upon the 
Change
 of 
New Ma∣sters.


These Extremities causing the 
States
 to break up their Dams, gave them leisure to think and consider of their 
Affairs:
 Whereupon they sent to the Princes of 
Germany
 the 
Propositions
 of 
Peace
 which both

 Kings had made them, thereby to prepossess their minds, with what they began already to harbour, as touching the 
Ambition
 of 
France:
 They laid before them the sad con∣dition to which they were reduced, and that if they delayed their 
Suc∣cour
 any longer, it would be too late, when they had a desire to do it. That their present 
Safety
 was in the Water, which could not al∣ways secure them. That when the Winter came the 
French
 would march over the 
Ice
 to storm their Walls: So that if they could not resist when the 
Provinces
 were en∣tire and flourishing, there was lit∣tle likelyhood they should now withstand so potent an 
Enemy,
 when they were fallen from their 
ancient
 Reputation.




These 
Remonstrances,
 of which they could not doubt the 
Truth,
 con∣sidering the lamentable 
Condition
 of the 
Republick,
 mov'd the 
Emperor
 to pity, as also the Marquiss of 
Bran∣denburgh,
 and several other Princes of the 
Empire:
 The Marquiss of 
Brandenburgh,
 as being the most po∣tent, was the first that took the field for their 
Relief:
 So that the King knowing that he had now to deal with a Prince stout, resolute and a try'd Souldier, rais'd his Camp from before 
Zeist,
 and returned toward 
France.
 But before his departure he resolved to try to make himself Master of 
Boysleduc,
 which was block'd up upon one side by the Garrison of 
Creveceur
 on the other by that of 
Endoue Bois le duc,
 is a 
Town
 seated in the midst of a Marsh, but

 notwithstanding the strength of its Scituation, the Fortifications are but weak. Nevertheless there is a Cittadel on that side next to 
Hol∣land,
 with two Forts on the other side next 
Maestricht,
 which however would signifie little, did not the Situation render it almost inaccessi∣ble. The King took up his Head Quarters at 
Boustel,
 but while he was preparing all things for a seige, God who had began to take 
Hol∣land
 into His 
Protection,
 sent such continual 
Rains
 for four or five days together, so that the Country being Level was immediately all under Water, as if the Sluces had been opened. The King however ho∣ping for hard 
Weather,
 stop't at 
Bockstel
 for eight or ten days, but finding the 
Weather
 continue bad,

 he Discamped and returned Home.


And now the Prince of 
Orange,
 who after the Death of the Pensio∣nary, had the sole Authority of command conferred upon Him, seeing the People in some sort of Repose upon the Retreat of the King of 
France,
 bethought himself of giving them yet further Con∣tent by the Punishment of 
Mombas;
 whose Head they eagerly demand∣ed. He had been conveyed from 
Utrick
 to 
Wordes,
 and from 
Wordes
 to 
Nieurburk,
 whether the 
Dutch
 Ar∣my was retired. Thereupon the Prince of 
Orange
 call'd a 
Counsel of War,
 and began to examin the bu∣siness, which appear'd every day more foul than other; at length his 
Conscience
 not permitting him a∣ny rest, and giving himself for lost,

 he began to think of making his e∣scape, which nevertheless was a difficult thing to do, by reason he was very strictly guarded, having 
Sentinels
 at his 
Chamber Door,
 and un∣der the Windows of his 
Lodging:
 While he was musing what course to take, one of his 
Friends
 brought him a 
Letter,
 which gave him to understand that he had but three Days to live, if he did not find some way to escape: For that the 
Council of War
 was resolv'd to make him an 
Example
 to others, and therefore advis'd him to look to himself. 
Mom∣bas
 finding himself so severely threatned, discours'd the same day with one of his 
Guards,
 who pro∣mis'd him for a certain Sum of 
Mo∣ney
 to let him escape out at the Win∣dow, when he should be put to

 stand 
Sentinel
 at that Post, which would fall out the next day. Having gone thus far, he also sounded a 
Spanish
 Officer, who was to be upon the 
Guard
 the same day, at a deep Water, to know if he would let him pass that way, and get him a 
Guide
 ready: The Officer no less covetous of Money than the 
Senti∣nel,
 agreed for an hundred 
Pistols
 to all that 
Mombas
 desired, The Bargain being thus driven, gave the 
Hundred Pistols
 to one 
Villare,
 who served him in the 
Nature
 of his 
Squire,
 and had been an Agent in the business, to carry them to the 
Spaniard:
 but 
Villare,
 instead of gi∣ving them to the 
Officer,
 ran quite away with them; whether it were that he were naturally enclin'd to such kind of 
Varlet
's Tricks, or

 whether his Master were in his 
Debt,
 and so he thought to pay him∣self while he had an opportunity; however it were 
Mombas
 reckning upon his 
Payment,
 made it his busi∣ness now to deceive the Watch that guarded him in sight; to which purpose,


He first complained of a great 
Pain
 in his 
Leg,
 upon which he sent for a 
Chyrurgeon,
 and shewing him his 
Leg,
 which by reason of a wound he had received was grown bigger than the other: He also de∣sired the 
Prince
 to send him one of his 
Chyrurgeons,
 who concluded, that his 
Grief
 required a large Plai∣ster, which they sent him to apply to the place affected; upon this pretence, he kept his Bed without any Suspition, and upon the day

 appointed he sent for some 
Tobacco,
 telling the 
Guards
 he would smoak a 
Pipe
 with them after 
Supper;
 but pretending of a suddain to be very sick, he went to Bed in the 
Souldi∣ers
 presence, desiring them withal to smoak their 
Tobacco
 in the next Chamber, because it offended him. The 
Souldiers
 seeing him in Bed, and not dreaming that he had a Design to escape, presently withdrew; who were no sooner out of the Chamber but 
Mombas
 slipt out of his Bed, took the 
Plaister
 from his Leg and clapt it upon his 
Eye,
 and leapt out at the Window where the 
Sentinel
 stood that had been brib'd, as alrea∣dy has been said.


In this 
Disguise
 he got through the Camp without being discover'd; but when he came to the 
Spaniard


 he was strangely surpriz'd to find, that he would not let him pass any farther, unless he gave him the 
Hun∣dred Pistols
 before-hand, which he had promised him. By this dispute 
Mombas
 presently discovered the Roguery and Treachery of his Man 
Villaire;
 but there was no retreiving that which was gone; and there∣fore he must now satisfie the 
Spani∣ard
 as well as he could; for the 
Spaniard
 was resolved he would have his Bargain, and 
Mombas
 had it not to pay over again. In the end being forced to make a Vertue of Necessity, he turned his Poc∣kets the inside outermost, and of∣fered him all he had about Him: But seeing that nothing but the 
Hundred
 Pistols would content him, 
Mombas
 told the 
Officer
 that he might

 do with him as he pleased, but if he were the occasion of his being retaken, he vowed to discover him in the first place, and therefore bid him quickly consider, for he had nothing farther to say. The Offi∣cer terrifyed with these 
Threats,
 took what 
Mombas
 was able to give him and let him pass with his 
Guides.
 After this 
Mombas
 waded up to the Wast in Water for three Leagues together, very often in danger of being drown'd. But it was but just that a Traitor who had occasi∣oned the Ruin of a Nation, should have his turn of Misery; who tho he endured a large Portion of Mis∣fortune and Hardship, yet suffered not the 
half
 of what he deserved.


Mombas
 being thus arrived at 
Wordes,
 after he had endured an O∣cean

 of Disasters more easie to ima∣gine than to describe, took a Room in the Boat that goes from 
Wordes
 to 
Uytrecht,
 but he was no sooner sat down, but he perceived that a Wo∣man who sat next him, knew him and had told his Name to another Woman that sat next to her. There∣upon in a Peck of Troubles he quitted the Boat, being resolved to take some other way. But not da∣ring to adventure the High road for fear of being known, he threw himself into any other guide then his own despair, having neither 
Sous
 nor 
Doit
 to help himself.


When he came within a quarter of a League of 
Utrecht
 he forsook the Water, but so bedaub'd with Mud and Dirt, that there was no possibility of presenting himself in

 that condition. Thereupon he got leave at the next House to dry his Cloaths, and so getting into the Town, he went to the 
Sign
 of the 
Palace Royal,
 where he met one of his 
Nephews
 by chance, who was a 
Captain
 in the 
French Army.
 His Ne∣phew seeing him enter, was so far from believing him to be his 
Uncle,
 that he took him for an 
Apparition:
 For there had lodged the night be∣fore a 
Person
 who came from 
Ni∣eurburgh,
 who had reported it for 
certain News,
 which he had seen with his own Eyes, that 
Mombas
's Head was cut off. And this 
Report
 was so spread about the City, that no body would believe that 
Mom∣bas
 was come to 
Town.


In the mean while the Duke of 
Luxembergh,
 who was then chief

 
Governour
 of 
Utrech,
 paus'd, whe∣ther he should admit 
Mombas
 into his presence or no? For on the one side he knew it might be of advan∣tage to discourse him, as who per∣fectly understood the 
Country;
 and on the other side he consider'd that it would be no good 
Policy,
 to give him a kind 
Reception,
 which would but convince the World of the 
pri∣vate Correspondence
 which he held with the King; which latter thoughts prevailing, he resolv'd not to see him at all, and therefore to those that told it him for great News, that 
Mombas
 was in Town, he made Answer that he did not be∣leive it, adding withal, that it could never be, that a Man who had born 
Arms
 against the King would put himself into his hands.

 Every Body understood what the Duke meant, so that all Peoples mouths being clos'd after that, there was no more mention made of 
Mombas,
 than if he never had been.


As for 
Mombas
 himself, when he understood, that the Duke of 
Lux∣embergh
 would not see him, he went to wait upon the Prince of 
Conde,
 at 
Arnheim,
 but that Prince be∣ing as 
Politick
 as the Duke of 
Luxem∣bergh,
 deny'd to speak with 
him,
 but in private, and that at such an 
hour,
 when all People else were asleep. Thereupon he sent the Captain of his Guards for him, about three of the Clock in the Morning, to bring him to his Quarters, where the Prince received him into his Closet, wrapt up in his great Leaguer Cloack. There he sold 
Holland
 a

 second time, disclosing all the se∣crets of that Republick, or at least as much as he knew before he was Arrested, and after he had informed the Prince of as much as he desired to know, he retired to 
Collogne,
 in expectance there of a Promission to return into 
France,
 which was one of the wry Faces he was to make, in hopes to wipe off the suspicions which he already lay under. Some∣time after he had intimation given him, that he might go and attend the Duke of 
Luxemburgh,
 who made use of him in the taking of 
Wordes,
 which the 
French
 quitted, after they had been only once Masters of it. He it was also that brought the 
Duke
 before this place, when the Prince of 
Orange
 beseig'd it; so that he seemed now as desirous to make

 his Treacherie publick, as he was before careful to conceal it.


Now though all this that I have said may seem to be rather a Histo∣ry of the War then a keeping close to my Subject, which is to set forth the falshood of 
France,
 however I beleive it not so remote from the matter neither, since it serves so well to recal to Memory the 
Idea
's of so many Treacheries and Breach∣es of Faith. In a word, though it cannot be denied but that the 
French
 are sufficiently couragious, yet we may say, that she rather chooses to joyn Subtlety and Slight to Strength, without which she could never prove so Successful in all her Enterprizes; though we must needs say at the same time that ano∣ther great Reason of Her Prospe∣rity

 is this, that Money costs Her lit∣tle or nothing; for to come now from War to Peace, let us examine how she brought to pass a separa∣tion of the Allies, and whether that Metal did not stand her in more stead then all the Rhetorick of her Ministers.


One of the great Obstacles of the Peace, was the great difficulty of Reconciling the Interests of the Crown of 
Sweden,
 from the Inte∣rests of those Princes who had any thing to do with it. As for the Crown of 
Sweden,
 its chiefest In∣terest was this, that as it was en∣gaged in a War only for the 
Service
 of 
France;
 that 
France
 should there∣fore cause 
Restitution
 to be made of all those Places, which either the King of 
Denmark,
 the Princes of

 
Brandenburgh,
 or of the House of 
Brunswick
 had taken from it. On the other side it was the Inte∣rest of those 
Princes
 not to hear talk of 
Peace,
 unless they might preserve all their 
Conquests,
 or at least a good part of them. The difficulty then was to reconcile these 
opposite In∣terests;
 now you shall see what it was that put this Affair into a fair way, and made it not so impossible as it seem'd to be. It hapned one day, at a 
Collation,
 that was given by one of the 
Three French Ministers,
 who understood the 
Court Secret,
 a 
Dish
 of 
Olives
 was set upon the 
Table,
 which the 
Swedish
 Embassa∣dor tasting, and liking very well, the 
French
 Embassador promis'd to send him a 
Barril,
 which his 
Secre∣tary
 soon after carry'd him. The

 
Swedish
 Minister was not a little sur∣pris'd to see the 
Secretary
 of the 
Em∣bassie
 become a 
Porter
 of 
Olives,
 but presently recollecting himself he took the 
Barril
 in his hand, and find∣ing it somewhat ponderous he ask∣ed the 
Secretary
 what was in the Barril? The 
Secretary
 made An∣swer, that his 
Excellency
 would see when he open'd it; and withal de∣sired him to open it himself, and not to let any body see him when he open'd it: Then the 
Swedish
 Em∣bassador knew what it meant, and so having dismissed the 
Secretary,
 he open'd the 
Barril
 which was cram∣med to the bottom with 
Golden Lewisses,
 among which he found a little Note wherein these words were contain'd, 
If You intend that we should send you more
 Olives, 
you must let Us have a Peace.




Now you will ask me how a thing that was carry'd so secretly on the Minister of 
France
's part, as on the Minister of 
Swedens,
 should come to my knowledge, to which I answer, how do so many secrets transacted in the Cabinet Councel, come to be known? but I must tell ye more then this, that 
France
 hap∣pening afterwards to be at variance with 
Sweden,
 took no great care to conceal a secret, since it was of no Importance to her to keep it pri∣vate. Rather she was glad of an opportuny to Divulge it, on pur∣pose to raise Jealousies and Mi∣strusts, among the Chief 
Grandees
 of 
Sweden,
 where the story is in e∣very bodies Mouth, insomuch that the Rupture between the two Crowns is attributed to it. In a

 
word,
 though the Homage which the King of 
France
 demanded of the King of 
Sweden,
 for the Dukedom of 
Deux Ponts,
 were a thing which that Young Prince took very un∣kindly, yet the more nimble Poli∣ticians beleive, that it would not have been a sufficient cause of a Rupture, had not the King of 
Sweden
 been exasperated before, by the Disadvantageous Peace which 
France
 had caused him to conde∣scend to; of which it will not be from the purpose to speak a word or two, in regard that while I was at 
Paris,
 I met with few of the 
French,
 who did not maintain that 
Sweden
 vvas extremely obliged to 
France,
 since she vvould not en∣dure to hear of any Treaty, till all vvas restored that had been con∣quered

 from 
Sweden.
 But they vvere Ignorant, that in lieu the 
Swede
 vvas constrained to deliver up to the Duke of 
Brandenburgh,
 several places in 
Pomerania,
 in the Dutchie of 
Bremen
 several places to the King of 
Denmark,
 and several other pla∣ces in the Bishoprick of 
Venden
 to the Princes of the House of 
Brun∣swick.
 But now I am speaking of 
Sweden,
 I will tell ye how the Dut∣chy of 
Deux Ponts
 came to be taken for Her, and under what pretence; the last Duke was a Healthy Per∣son and like to live long, when 
France
 who lik'd the Country very well, as lying fit for Her, proje∣cted how to get possession of it, having not yet bethought her self of the 
Knack
 of 
Dependency,
 under pretence of which she has since in∣vaded

 so many Provinces. Now you must understand that the 
Duke
 having no Children, the Dukedom after his Death fell to the House of 
Swedland,
 though not immediately to the King of 
Swedland,
 in regard that 
Duke Adolphus
 pretended to ex∣clude him as being the next in pro∣pinquity of Blood to the present Possessor. On the other side the King 
of Sweden
 pretended that the 
Dukedom
 should descend to 
Him,
 as being the Son of the Eldest House, which seemed a very likely pre∣tence. For though in several parts of 
Germany
 the Custom is such, that the next of Kin to the Deceased succeeds to his Estate, yet in the Electoral Families, especially the 
Palatine,
 which was then in dispute, the Usuage is quite otherwise. How∣ever

 it were the King of 
France,
 who was willing to make the Pro∣verb good, That while two are in dispute for the Possession, there comes a third and carries away the Prize, sent a considerable force to make himself Master of the Dut∣chy of 
Deux Ponts,
 under pretence nevertheless to preserve it for the King of 
Sweden,
 in whose favour he had decided the difference a∣gainst Duke 
Adolph.
 The Duke of 
Deux Ponts,
 who was still living, was nothing surprized that the 
French
 had entred his Country, as having often been subject to their violences, but he wondred not a little when he understood that they came to claim the Succession, espe∣cially finding himself so likely to live, and having no desire to die so

 soon. Nevertheless the 
French
 having taken Possession of the place of his Residence, he saw not only his 
Coun∣try
 reduced to slavery, but himself a kind of Prisoner; for in regard the 
French
 could not choose but think that a Prince of such a Noble and Illustrious 
Birth
 would not easily condescend to live under 
Tutelage,
 & fearing least that he would call the 
Emperor
 to his 
Assistance
 they watch∣ed him so narrowly, that he might well be lookt upon rather as a Pri∣soner then a Freeman.


However 
France,
 who was desi∣rous to make sure of the King of 
Sweden,
 of whom she then stood in need (for all this happened during the War) gave him to understand that what she had done was only in 
kindness
 to 
Him;
 so that the 
Swede










 not dreaming but that 
France
 meant as she said, began to talk of send∣ing a Governour into the 
Dutchy,
 but while he offered the Govern∣ment sometimes to the Count of 
Carlson,
 his natural Brother in lieu of something that he had taken from 
Him,
 and sometimes to a Prince of the House of 
Baden,
 the King of 
France
 sent thither the Prince Palatine of 
Berkenfield,
 and reconciled the Prince of 
Baden,
 and the Count of 
Carlson,
 who began to look with an evil aspect one up∣on another, as it is the Custom of two Persons, that aspire both to one Command.


The Peace ensuing soon after, 
France,
 who had no mind to part with so toothsom a Morsel, be∣thought her self of the Right of

 Dependency, and demanded Ho∣mage and Fealty from the King of 
Sweden.
 This pretention altoge∣ther new, extremely surprized the 
Swedish
 King, but in regard the 
Dutchy
 lies at a great distance from his Dominions, the chiefest part of his Ministers concluded to let it pass, and not to quarrel with 
France,
 at what time 
France,
 who had laid this Rub in the way, only because she would not restore what she had got into her Clutches, caused Duke 
Adolph
 to interpose himself to the end, that according as they had a∣greed among themselves, she might remain always in the Possession.


And thus as she had despoiled the Old Duke in his life time, who ended his days for sorrow remote from his own Territories, so she

 scruples not to keep from their Rights to other Princes still alive and live like. And it is very pro∣bable, that without considering whether the claim belong to the King of 
Sweden,
 or Duke 
Adolph,
 that she will rather choose to sur∣render it to the 
Palatine
 of 
Birken∣field,
 then to either of the other two, as being loath it should fall into the Hands of the King of 
Sweden,
 for fear of enlarging the Power of a Prince, whose Friendship she has so little reason to hope, and having the same reason to be jealous of 
Duke Adolph,
 whose Interest it is to keep firmly united to the Head of his own Family.


Moreover, it cannot but be a great trouble to the Palatine 
House,
 to see such a number of Princes be∣come

 subject to 
France.
 For be∣sides that, the Person upon whom 
France
 shall be pleased to confer the 
Dutchie
 of 
Deux Ponts,
 will be ob∣liged to do her Homage, how ma∣ny others are there, who at this day groan under the weight of her Fet∣ters: The Prince 
de la petite Pierre
 could say something, if the unfor∣tunate example of one of his Kins∣men did not oblige Him to silence. I could speak of the Prince of 
Wel∣dens,
 who for having the soul of a Prince, and being willing to pre∣serve himself in that high Dignity where Providence has placed him by Birth, might starve, if his own Subjects had not pity upon him; I say that he might starve; nor do I aggravate the matter; for 'tis well known to many others, be∣sides

 my self, that because he would not do Homage to 
France,
 he has been dispossessed of his 
Territory,
 and lives now in a hired House upon the Alms of his Subjects. 'Tis as vvell knovvn to vvhat a mean con∣dition his Son is reduced. 'Tis vvell 
known,
 I say, that his Father not having vvherevvithal to sup∣port him, that rides up and dovvn upon a sorry Nag vvithout any Train or Attendance, like the poor∣est Gentleman in 
France,
 being at length constrain'd to put himself in∣to the 
Service
 of the 
States,
 vvho have given him a 
Foot Company,
 vvhich is all he has to subsist upon at this Day.


Some perhaps may ask me, vvhy the 
Prince
 of 
Weldens
 carries himself so untractably considering his ovvn

 vveakness, against a 
Power
 so ab∣solute? vvhy does he not give vvay to the 
Times,
 as others do; and in a Word, vvhat difference there is be∣tvveen being a 
Vassal
 to the 
Emperor
 and a 
Homager
 to the King of 
France.
 For I knovv these are the 
Discourses
 generally in the 
Mouths
 not only of those that follovv the 
Interests
 of 
France,
 but also of several others, who cannot but compassionate the 
Misfortunes
 of this 
Prince,
 and en∣deavour to help him: To this I an∣swer that the Prince of 
Wildens,
 fin∣ding himself reduced to utmost ne∣cessity, has sought an 
Accommodati∣on
 by all-manner of ways; but he could never resolve to be a 
Slave.
 In short, when he saw that a great many 
Princes
 of his 
Family
 had shew∣ed him the way, he sent his 
Son
 in∣to

 
France,
 who offer'd on his 
Fathers
 behalf to do 
homage
 to the 
King,
 pro∣vided he would use him like a 
Prince
 and suffer him to enjoy the same 
Rights
 and 
Privileges,
 as before the 
Change
 of his 
Affairs:
 But the King laugh'd at his 
Proposals,
 so that the young 
Gentleman
 was forc'd to re∣turn as wise as he went. Never∣theless if I may reflect upon the present 
Condition
 of the 
German Prin∣ces,
 and what it was formerly, we may easily see how they abuse themselves, that think there is no difference between a 
Vassal
 to the 
Emperor,
 and a 
Vassal
 to the King of 
France:
 But I do ill, to say a 
Vassal
 to the 
Emperor;
 for all the 
Princes
 of the 
Empire,
 I mean the 
Soveraign Princes,
 as the 
Electors
 and several other great 
Houses,
 are ra∣ther

 
Members
 of the 
Empire,
 not the 
Emperor
's 
Vassals.
 They are indeed oblig'd to assist the 
Empire,
 under 
Forfeiture
 of their 
Privileges
 and 
Ter∣ritories,
 but they are not oblig'd to assist the 
Emperor,
 unless he be first attack'd. Let us then conclude that this Word 
Vassal
 is not properly ap∣plyed to the 
Princes
 of 
Germany,
 who have 
Soveraign Authority
 within their own 
Dominions,
 as much as the 
Em∣peror
 exercises in His own. They have the 
Power
 of 
Life
 and 
Death,
 they impose 
Taxes
 and 
Subsidies
 at their pleasure, & lastly are accoun∣table for their 
Actions
 to none but God. Let us conclude, I say, that such 
Princes
 as these, who enjoy all the 
Marks
 of 
Soveraignty,
 are far dif∣ferent from the 
Princes
 of 
France,
 who except that they stand with

 their Hats on, when the King gives 
Audience
 to 
Embassadors,
 are in no∣thing else more than other Subjects. It may be said in some 
Sort,
 that they are inferiour to some of the Kings Subjects; for the 
Dukes
 and 
Peers
 take the 
Precedency
 of them, and that the 
Princes
 are oblig'd not to appear at any 
Ceremony,
 least they should be constrain'd to walk after them. Nevertheless if we look back to the beginning of the last 
Century
 we shall find that among those 
Dukes,
 there are some, whose 
Fathers
 were only 
Notaries,
 others no more than 
Merchants
 in 
Paris.
 And we know what the 
Descendants
 from one of these great 
Families
 did not long since, to conceal the knowledg of such a mean and ignominious 
Ex∣traction:
 We know that they caus'd

 an 
Epitaph
 in the Church of St. 
In∣nocents
 to be eras'd, instead of which we find another in the 
Celestins,
 wherein there are as many 
Falshoods
 as there were 
Truths
 in the other.


And yet it so falls out, that 
Prin∣ces,
 whose 
Ancestors
 were in the 
Num∣ber
 of 
Soveraign Princes,
 are at this day forc'd to submit to Men of that low and sordid 
Extraction.
 To which I may add, that the 
Princes
 of the 
Blood
 themselves are glad to 
court
 and 
fawn
 upon Persons of a much lower and baser 
Extraction
 than what I have already mention'd. We know the way to 
rise
 in 
France
 is not to stir from the 
Anti-chamber
 of a 
Great Minister;
 and a Colonel of 
Horse,
 whose Name I could tell, and one whom every Body knows as well as I, does not disdain to be

 a 
Buffoon
 to one of the 
Secretaries
 of 
State:
 For which reason he quitted his 
Regiment,
 for fear, least in time of War, some other 
Minion
 might step into his 
Honourable Employment.
 'Tis well known also that while Monsieur 
Colbert
 sate at Diner, the greatest Lords of 
France
 sate pum∣ping for a Jest to make him laugh, and he that had had the best 
Success,
 glory'd in his happy Fortune, as if it had been he who had defended 
Vienna
 against the 
Turks.
 Lastly 'tis well known, and yet a thing which a Man would hardly believe, that Monsieur the 
Kings
 only 
Brother
 is oblig'd to have recourse to them, when he has any particular 
Favour
 to beg of the 
King,
 and that not∣withstanding this 
Submission,
 he ma∣ny times is forc'd to go without the

 
Grant
 of his 
Petition.
 I could prove by a 
Thousand Examples
 what I here alledg; but it shall suffice to men∣tion only what happen'd about a year or two since, upon the score of a 
Person
 whom the 
Monsieur
 had a kind desire to put into one of the 
King
's 
Farms;
 for not being able to obtain what he desir'd of Monsieur 
Colbert
 after many and many 
Entrea∣ties,
 he was forced himself at length to speak to the 
King.


To give a little farther proof of the 
Tyrannies
 of the 
Ministers
 of 
France,
 and how the lofty 
Princes
 are forced to cringe and bow before those 
Idols,
 there needs no more than to repeat what hapned some few days since to Monsieur the 
Dauphin,
 he had beg'd of Monsieur 
Segnaly,
 the Son of Mr. 
Colbert,
 the Employ∣ment

 of 
Purser
 of a Ship, for a Son of one of his 
Domesticks,
 which Monsieur 
Segnalay
 having granted Him with great difficulty, this same 
Minister
 of the last 
Edition
 took a 
Fancy
 sometime after to displace the 
Purser,
 pretending him uncapable of the 
Imployment.
 The 
Dauphin
 un∣derstanding this, told Monsieur 
Segnaly
 that it was his desire the Per∣son might be restor'd, and that if he had done amiss, it was only for his want of years, and that he him∣self would undertake the 
Young man
 should do better for the future. Monsieur 
Segnalay
 having heard the Prince with that Gravity which he so awkardly affects, made answer, that the thing was out of his Pow∣er, and that therefore he must speak to the 
King:
 But Monsieur the 
Dau∣phin


 not enduring that a Person of his 
Condition
 should so unworthily requite the 
Honour
 which he did him, Schol'd him so severely that he soon humbled his vain-glorious 
Pride.


Let us then conclude from hence that it is a great 
Misfortune
 for a Prince to be born a 
Subject
 of the 
Crown
 of 
France,
 and a great 
Impru∣dence
 in him that is free to put him∣self under the 
Yoak.
 Ask the Prince 
Palatine
 who is only his 
Neighbour,
 how he likes his 
Neighbourhood,
 and I am sure he will tell you, there is no difference from being a 
Subject
 and a Neighbour. If he speaks like a Prince, they speak to him like Masters, and if he intends that 
France
 should let him be at quiet, He must submit to all her Demands. Let us ask him whether he hath any

 Subjects that are 
Faithful
 to him a∣mong so many 
Subjects
 as are obedi∣ent to him? and whether 
France
 have not quite debauch'd their 
Alle∣giance?
 Lastly let us ask him whe∣ther he dares complain, though e∣very day he finds one Corner or o∣ther of his Territories lopt off from his Subjection, and whither they do not tell him on the other side, that he is happy to be under the Protection of so great a Potentate? Let us now visit the Courts of the other Princes of 
Germany,
 and see what passes there, before we make any Reflection upon the Princes of 
France.
 What shall we say of the Ec∣clesiastical Electors; of which the one sells his Country by the sugge∣stion of 
her Emissaries;
 the other suffers her self to be scar'd by her 
Emissaries:


 & the other is so obedient to her 
Will
 as if the same Interest actuated in all. Yet at the same time let us confess, that this is not done with∣out some sort of Violence, for who questions the various Tricks and gins that are made use of daily to separate 'em from their real Inte∣rests? To some they pretend, that the most part of their Territories are Dependencies upon the Crown, and that if they do not use all means to Captivate the Kings fa∣vours, he will no longer suffer 'em to enjoy that to which they have no Right at all; so that while he deprives them of the true Chara∣cter of Soveraign, which is to be independent in their Authority, he endeavours to insinuate the contra∣ry, that their dependance upon 
France
 is the only way to support

 their Dominion. To others he cries, that they have nothing to do but to consider his 
Power,
 & from thence to assure themselves that they have no other hopes but in 
Him;
 and while he feeds them with these fair 
Hopes,
 he boys up the 
People
 in their 
Disobedi∣enc,
 to the end the Soveraigns may always standing in need of him, to suppress their mutinies. It may well be thought that I speak of 
Liege,
 where 
France
 holds her 
Di∣van
 contrary to the Faith of 
Treaties,
 and where the 
Dissentions
 between the People and their 
Sovereign,
 make her as absolutely Mistress of the City, as if it belonged solely to 
Her;
 for who is so blind as not to see through her Politicks upon this occasion? For being in conti∣nual fear, least Monsieur of 
Cologne
 should at length open his Eyes, she

 resolves to have a Remedy ready against all manner of Accidents. And therefore as she maintained the People of 
Messina
 in their Rebelli∣on, so will she support the Inhabi∣tants of 
Liege
 in all their Rebelli∣ous Practices, should 
Monsieur
 of 
Cologne
 at any time bethink himself of re-assuming his Lawful Sove∣raignty. For indeed if this were not the Intention of 
France,
 what could hinder 
Monsieur Cologne
 at this day, from reducing to Obedience a City which is open on all sides, without Fortifications or any Gar∣rison. It were then to be wished that he would come again to him∣self, and consider that his Alliance with 
France,
 has only serv'd to draw upon him the hatred of his People, and the utter Ruin of his Country

 for not to mention the Imperial-Armies, who have been Constrained to feed upon his Country, we see How he has been treated himself, by those in whom he has put all his hopes and confidence. Who can be Ignorant of the Horrible Contri∣butions which 
France
 has Levied upon his Subjects, the General De∣solation of his 
Territory,
 the Sacking and Plundering of his 
Towns,
 and the Destruction of his 
Citadels
 and other Stately 
Buildings?
 Who can be Ignorant of what Happened at the 
Hay,
 where the 
French
 not contented, to have 
Tyranniz'd
 o're the 
Inhabitants,
 threw the 
Castle
 to the 
Ground,
 and ru∣in'd one of the 
Noblest Bridges
 upon the 
Meuse,
 by which meanes that 
City
 finds her self 
depriv'd
 of all her chief∣est & most considerable 
advantages


 for having admitted them within her Walls. But let us go on to the other Princes of 
Germany,
 and see whether they have any more rea∣son to boast of the 
French
 kindnesses.


I could Epitomize all at once what I have to say to this point, by only declaring what happened but lately to the King of 
Danemark.
 For as it may be easie for others to judge what they are to expect, by the carriage of the 
French
 toward their Allies, therefore in my opi∣nion, that might suffice to prove the 
Violence
 of her Proceedings, and how she goes about to make her self Mistress of the whole World. But in regard there are several that would be glad to see what pretty 
Courses
 she takes to bring about her 
Designs,
 I will give you a short ac∣count

 of her 
Maxims
 and 
De∣vices.


There is no Body can be igno∣rant of the 
Marriage
 of the 
Dauphin
 with the 
Dauphiness.
 The great 
Re∣phuation
 which Monsieur of 
Bavaria,
 and the great 
Sway
 which he carries in the 
Empire,
 as well by reason of the 
Extent
 of his 
Dominions,
 as also by reason of their 
Situation,
 caus'd him to be courted of all hands du∣ring the last War, as He who brought a great Accession of 
Strength
 to the side for which he should declare. The King of 
France
 being careful of losing such an Ad∣vantage, dayly made him a 
Thou∣sand
 advantageous 
Propositions
 to en∣gage himself in his 
Interests.
 On the other side the 
Emperor
 was no less sedulous to gain him to his 
Party.


 So that the Duke of 
Bavaria
 judg∣ing of his Power by the Applica∣tions that were made to him, re∣solved to hear both, and to fix where he could make his best Markets.


As for the 
Emperor
 he only offer∣ed him a League Offensive and De∣fensive against 
France,
 whose Am∣bitious designs he laid before him, beleiving that enough to bring him over to the 
German
 Interest: But 
Bavaria
 being in hopes of some∣thing more advantageous, listened more willingly to the propositions of 
France,
 which the 
French
 endea∣voured to make as acceptible as possibly they could. In short too many politick Arguments, which might have been more prevalent at some other time, but now of lit∣tle or no effect, they added most

 magnificent Presents, which they were careful to renew from time to time; so that 
Princes
 being wrought upon many times by such kind of 
Temptations
 as well as other Persons, the Duke began to be more and more enclined to 
France.
 Madam of 
Bavaria,
 whom the King had formerly had some thoughts to have married, and who was not a little troubled that she had missed the preferment, hoping to advance her Daughter to the 
Throne
 which she had failed off, prest her 
Hus∣band
 with all her might to the 
French
 Alliance, provided he made sure of the Advancement of his 
Daugh∣ter,
 who could not expect a more advantageous match in all 
Europe.


Nor was it long before the Mi∣nisters of 
France
 discovered what

 had passed in the Duke of 
Bavarias
 Cabinet, and therefore beleiving it would be more kindly taken to pre∣vent the Duke, by proposing the Match before the Duke offered it himself, they declared that they had orders from their Master to di∣scourse him about it; and this they also made known to Madam of 
Ba∣varia,
 who was ready to leap out of her skin for joy. After this pro∣position thus made, the Emperors Ministers were no longer minded, and nothing was discoursed of but the future Alliance, which was the Foundation of the ensuing Treaty between 
France
 and 
Bavaria,
 by which the Duke of 
Bavaria
 promi∣sed to remain 
Neuter,
 which was all that 
France
 desir'd. For in regard that 
Bavaria
 had a powerful 
Army
 on 
foot,
 & that he was 
resolved
 to stand 
Neu∣ter,


 so long at the 
War
 endured, 
France
 conjectured, and that not without reason, that the Emperor would be awed by his potent strength, which would be as beneficial to 
France,
 as if the Duke acted openly. And by the Event it appeared that those 
Conjectures
 were not ill groun∣ded. But not to make a repetition of things known to every body; it will suffice to say, that this Treaty continued till the Treaty of 
Ni∣meghen,
 and that the Mariage of 
Madamoiselle
 of 
Bavaria
 was soon af∣ter 
consummated,
 there being at that time no Princes in 
Europe
 unmarried, either of a nobler 
Family,
 or endow'd with more Princely Qualities.


And now 
France
 thought her self secure of the House of 
Bavaria,
 but the Duke and Dutches dying, and the 
Dukedom
 falling into the 
Hands


 of a 
Prince,
 more clear sighted than his Father and Mother, 
France
 finding he did not stand so right for their Turn, made it their business to fasten him by some new Ally∣ance. To this purpose, because their is nothing sooner tempts a young Prince then Beauty, chiefly when it is accompanied by great Merit, the Ministers of 
France
 so ordered it, that they whom they had gained to their Party, should fill his Ears with their discourses of 
Madam Blois,
 the Kings natural Daughter, who appearing so love∣ly in her tender Age, promised to be in a short time, one of the most charming Persons in the World. 
Monsieur
 of 
Bavaria
 perceiving him∣self perhaps smitten with what was imprinted every hour in his mind,

 or else out of 
Curiosity
 to know whe∣ther Fame did not too much exalt the 
Beautys
 of that Lady, seem'd to intimate as if he should not be un∣willing to see her 
Picture.
 Of which his most 
faithful Friends,
 and those that were more jealous of his 
Honor
 being inform'd, they made him so effectually sensible of the Snares that were spread for his 
Youth,
 that the Prince recollecting his 
Thoughts,
 began to be 
asham'd
 of what 
perhaps
 he had only done out of 
Curiosity.


In the mean time several 
Portrai∣tures
 of Madam 
de Blois
 were sent from 
France,
 but the 
Ministers
 of that 
Crown,
 perceiving that the 
Ille∣gitimacy
 of her 
Birth,
 defaced all the Impressions that her 
Beauty
 could make, gave over the 
Design
 of that 
Match,
 of which they had concei∣ved

 such hopes a little before.


After this they proposed another Match to the 
Bavarian,
 which was certainly much more suitable: And that was between the 
Duke
 and 
Ma∣damoiselle
 the Queen of 
Spains
 Sister, and Daughter to the 
Duke
 of 
Or∣leans.
 But the 
Bavarian
 Ministers, who had diverted his first Passions, easily beat him off from this, per∣swading him that it was only a 
snare
 to keep him from allying with the 
Emperor,
 whose Daughter he might be in hopes to marry, which would not be only a greater advantage to him, but more necessary and re∣quisite for his Interests. That it behov'd him to have his Eyes open and to look upon the 
Designs
 of 
France,
 which were only to ruine the 
Emperor
 and the 
Empire.
 That

 it was true she fed him from time to time with fair 
Fancies,
 as that she would cause him to be 
Elected King
 of the 
Romans;
 but that the bottom of her 
Design
 was only to disunite the 
Princes
 one from another, that when the 
Election
 should happen, she might be the better able to carve for her self, what she offer'd to others. That it was not his 
Inte∣rest
 to desire a 
Neighbourhood
 so dreadful to all that had been so un∣fortunate to be her 
Neighbours;
 which was no 
Reproach
 or 
Detracti∣on,
 and that there needed no more than the 
Consideration
 of their 
Condi∣tion
 to make others sensible of the danger of 
Falling
 into the like.


These sage 
Councels,
 made that 
Impression
 which might well be ex∣pected upon the mind of a Prince,

 who lov'd 
Honour
 and scorn'd to stoop under 
Subjection.
 On the o∣ther side the 
French Ministers
 not re∣lishing these 
Proceedings,
 were so en∣rag'd at the Dukes 
Refusal
 of their propounded Match; that they had the 
Insolence
 to tell him, that if the Duke of 
Bavaria
 had married 
Ma∣dammoiselle de Blois,
 it had been no Disparagement to him. That there was no doubt but that Princes as puissant as himself would desire her in 
Marriage,
 who were like to go without her for all that; and that the King was sufficiently potent to 
Revenge
 one day the 
scorn
 and 
con∣tempt
 which he had put upon his 
Alliance.
 These 
Rhodomontadoes
 gave the Duke sufficiently to understand, how 
France
 at first wound her self in by softness and mildness, but that

 she was still for force where that fail'd. But these Proceedings ser∣ving to no other end then to alie∣nate the Duke the farther off from the 
French,
 he presently treated with the 
Emperor,
 with whom he might be certain to find more Honour, and more Security.


Nor has the Duke of 
Saxonie
 more reason to applaud the Con∣duct of 
France,
 who finding that Prince fast link'd to the true Inte∣rest of 
Germany,
 not suffering him∣self to be fed with her empty pro∣mises, has raised him up several E∣nemies both at home and abroad, and used all imaginable tricks to set him at variance with the 
Princes
 of his 
Family,
 but not being 
able
 to bring her designs to pass: She had been tampering with the 
Princes
 his 
Neigh∣bours,


 which occasioned those jea∣lousies so prudently already laid asleep by the Emperor.


As for the Marquiss of 
Branden∣burgh
 and the King of 
Danemark,
 I know nothing that could beget a greater Aversion to 
France,
 then her behaviour towards them. For if we look upon the manner how she came to intrude her self into their 
Confidence,
 we shall find that she has left no 
Tricks
 unplaid to bring it to pass, but after she had got her Ends, there was no sort of 
Severity
 and 
Cruelty
 which she did not exercise to their 
Dammage.
 The 
Propositions
 are well known; which were made by the Count 
de Roy,
 upon his 
Arrival
 in the 
North.
 'Tis well known, I say, that he demanded of the 
King
 of 
Danemark,
 in the name of the

 
King
 his Master, that he might have a share in the 
Disbursement
 of the Money which he received from Him, adding withal, that the Mo∣ney was wasted to little purpose: He demanded also little less of the Duke of 
Brandenburgh;
 yet fearing to provoke those 
Princes,
 jealous of their Honours, by such kind of harsh Complements, he kept his 
Pensioners,
 or else certain 
Frenchmen
 still at their Elbows to mollifie and sweeten those severe Pieces of 
Court∣ship;
 so that those 
Princes
 being de∣tain'd, as I may say, between hope and fear, knew not what to resolve upon. But let us admire the 
Poli∣ticks
 of that Crown, which draws it's 
Advantages
 from all things, even from those things that seem to be 
contrary
 and 
prejudicial
 to it's 
Interest.




Every one knows how Monsi∣eur 
de Bricquant
 was prosecuted; who after he had been a long time in the 
Bastile,
 for being stedfast to his Principles, was at length for∣ced to fly his 
Country,
 having no∣thing more to hope from his ser∣ving 
France;
 where he had never∣theless spent all his youthful years: but so soon as 
France
 understood, that he was gone to 
Brandenburgh,
 and that he was received by the E∣lector, her Malice was not only ap∣peased of a suddain, but she would needs Recommend him to that Prince, not immediately as from her self, for that would have been suspicious; but indirectly by the means of her Generals, so that this same Recommendation accompa∣nied with the merit of the Person,

 got him in a short time a Regiment of Horse with the Government of 
Wesel;
 and of this Person it is that she makes use, but cunningly and slily to obtain her desires; For tho he does not appear to be entrusted with the secret, but that on the con∣trary, he still complains of his suf∣ferings and hard usage in 
France,
 he knows how to give the blow when Opportunity serves, a Blow so much the more dangerous, as com∣ing from a kind and unsuspected Hand.


Boisdavid,
 who was constrained to fly 
France,
 where he was a 
Bri∣gadier
 and Colonel of Foot, for ha∣ving duell'd Monsieur 
d'Aubijoux,
 understood the way to regain her 
Favour
 by managing her 
Interests
 in the Court of 
Zell,
 where he was

 advantageously preferr'd, so that nothing there pass'd of which Mon∣sieur 
de Louvois
 was not advertis'd from time to time. And that which was most extraordinary was this, that though there be no Mercy for those who are accus'd of the same Crime that he was, he forbears not to make a Journey sometimes to 
Paris,
 whether it be upon his own occasions, or which is most likely to confer with Monsieur 
de St. Po∣vange,
 about such things as he dares not commit to Writing.


All the Courts of the other 
Prin∣ces
 are in the same manner stuft ei∣ther with bannish'd or 
Malecontented French.
 But at the same time those Princes give 'em Entertainment, if it may not be said that they receive Serpents into their Bosoms, at least

 we may say, that they are to be very wary how they easily trust 'em with their Secrets. For besides that the 
Genius
 of the 
French
 Nation carrys them to insinuate themselves into all manner of business, they rarely forget their Fidelity to their Prince, so that it is a great piece of 
Imprudence
 to confide in their 
A∣ctions.


Having thus discoursed of the Misfortunes daily attending those Princes who are 
Neighbours
 to 
France
 or that are in any sort of 
Amity
 with Her, let us now see in what a 
Condi∣tion
 they are, who are envellop'd by her in her 
Claims
 of Dependen∣cies. I will say nothing of the Prince of 
Petite Pierre,
 or of 
Weldens,
 of whom we have spoken suffici∣ently already, but I will mention

 something of the Prince of 
Baden,
 who no sooner came to be in the number of Her Subjects, but he was constrained to give a large 
Pen∣sion
 to his Wife, who left him a long time since, with a resolution never to Cohabit with him any more. He might shew himself ready as he did, to take her home again, but there was no regard had to Reasons, and the first thing im∣posed upon him was to ascertain Her a revenue, where he could not come to Finger it. I pass over in silence the Tyranny which She Ex∣ercises over other Princes of less repute; for since the Princes of the Sovereign Families, are no other∣wise spared then as I have related, there is no likelihood that the rest should fare any better. It would

 be tedious to recount what they daily suffer from those Petty 
Tyrants,
 who, of great Ministers 
Lacquies,
 becoming 
Commissaries,
 and Com∣missary 
Intendants,
 assume to them∣selves a Soveraign Authority. Nor are they contented to deprive these Princes of their 
Honour,
 but of their 
Estates.
 How many suits do they commence against them for the 
De∣cision
 of 
Limits,
 and several other slight occasions; insomuch that those Princes, who but lately had the Power of Life and Death over their Subjects, are now forced to go and answer their suits at the 
Bar,
 and frequently loose their Causes. For it is a Maxim of 
France
 to sup∣port the Vassals against their 
Lords,
 well knowing, that as long as they have the People of their side, the

 Princes and Gentry are not to be feared at all, who can do little with∣out the People, so that Her Interest sweys Her beyond all manner of Justice, provided she can thereby Establish her Dominion, or rather her absolute Tyranny.


If we pass from hence to her u∣sage of the meaner Gentry, how many may we find ruin'd by their Garrisons: For she does not stop at ordinary Forms to establish her 
Do∣minion,
 though it be the Law to seize the Lands only of those that refuse Homage and Fealty, how many has she nevertheless imprisoned, to the end that by detaining at the same time, both their Persons and their Estates, necessity may con∣strain them to an absolute Subje∣ction to her Pleasure? But the 
Con∣summation


 of her Tyranny and In∣justice was her severity to the 
Baron de L'Evenop,
 a Gentleman of qua∣lity, and of a Family that once ho∣noured 
Sweden
 with a Queen. For after 
France
 had received his Fealty and Homage, she dispossessed him of his demeans, no person being able to say for what reason, nor could she ever give any her self, but her own covetous thirst after other Peoples Estates.


There is no Prince in 
Europe
 who has not had a taste of her violences: who though they are sufficiently powerful to repress her 
Insolence,
 yet such is their blindness, that instead of uniting together for the com∣mon good, one would think they had conspir'd by their Disunion to surrender into her hands the 
Empire


 of the World. They know that she is in League with the 
Turk
 to harrass 
Germany,
 one on one side, and the other on the other side, and yet they will not unite to destroy an Enemy that seeks to reduce them to utter Slavery.


And now since I have mention'd this 
Allyance
 with the 
Turk,
 it may not be amiss to convince those who have hitherto seem'd to make some question of the Truth of it, and that by one 
Circumstance
 against which there is no 
Reply.
 Every one knows the vigorous 
Resistance
 which the Count of 
Starenbergh
 Governour of 
Vienna
 made against the 
Turk.
 So that the 
Grand Visier
 after the loss of an 
Infinite Number
 of his Men, would have raised the Siege, if he could have done it with 
Honour.
 To which

 purpose he sent back Count 
Albert Caprara,
 who was Embassador at the 
Emperors Court,
 whom he would never permit to return before that, to make him some 
Propositions
 of 
Peace,
 much more reasonable than those which he had proposed be∣fore: But the Marquiss of 
Seppeville
 who attended the 
Emperor
 from the King of 
France,
 being advertis'd thereof, dispatch'd a 
Currier
 to his Master to give him advice of it; up∣on which 
Information France
 sent a∣nother to the 
Grand Visier,
 to lay be∣fore him the 
Dishonour
 it would be to his 
Reputation,
 to raise the 
Siege
 so ignominiously after had lost such a Number of Men: Therefore that he would enter 
Flanders
 to constrain the 
Princes
 of the 
Rhine
 to recal their 
Succours,
 which they had sent to the

 
Emperor;
 by which 
Diversion
 he might soon accomplish his 
Design.
 Monsieur 
Seppeville
's Currier arriv'd at 
Fountain Bleau
 the 22d. of 
August
 between 
eight
 and 
nine
 of the Clock in the Morning. The Person who was dispatch'd to the 
Grand Visier,
 or to Monsieur 
Seppeville,
 which is the same thing, went away at 
one
 of the Clock in the 
Afternoon;
 and the same 
Afternoon
 they did not only noise abroad their 
Intentions
 of inva∣ding 
Flanders,
 but orders were also given out in order thereto; so that the 
Grand Visier
 not questioning but that the 
French
 would keep their words this time more punctually than they had done before, continu∣ed his seige, and it is very probable that he would never have raised it, had he not been constrained to it,

 till he had been Master of the Town. Which having brought me to speak of 
France
's breach of 
Faith
 to the 
Grand Visier,
 it will not be amiss to tell the cause of it. Cer∣tain it is that by a 
Private Treaty
 be∣tween 
France
 and the Ottoman 
Port,
 for which 
Teckeley
 became security, and one whose name was 
Bohan
 the Instrument that managed the busi∣ness, 
France
 was obliged to attach the Empire upon the side next the 
Rhine,
 at what time the 
Ottoman
 was to invade 
Hungary.
 To which purpose the King of 
France
 was al∣ready advanced upon the 
Frontiers;
 but finding that the 
Turks
 having made such a prosperous Progress at the beginning, that he made no question but that they would carry 
Vienna,
 where they had already

 planted their seige, had put all 
Ger∣many
 into such a Consternation, that all the Princes of the Empire gave themselves for lost, he stopped his March neither out of Moderation nor Christianity; but fearing to loose the good opinions of the Princes, imagining that in the condition to which they were reduced, they would be constrained to fly to him for Succour. And therefore think∣ing himself cock sure of the 
Empire,
 he would not carry Terror and De∣solation into a place which he ex∣pected so soon to command; which was the reason that he rather set up∣on 
Spain
 than the 
Empire.
 For he was always in hopes, that if the 
Turks
 got possession of 
Vienna,
 there was not any but himself that could oppose so formidable a Power, as

 if the Princes of the 
Empire
 would not rather have chosen to have be∣come Tributary to the 
Turk,
 then to have submitted to the Yoak of 
French
 slavery. In a word, not to speak any more of Her Tyranny, which is incomparably more intol∣lerable than 
Pagan
 Servitude, may we not probably believe that she will exercise the same severy over their Conscience, not permitting the publick worship of God, where∣as among the 
Heathens
 you shall ne∣ver hear of those terrible Edicts, that commanded the demolishing of Churches, nor of Souldiers that only serve for Hangmen and Exe∣cutioners, to those that assembled together upon their Ruins, to sing Praises to their Creator.




But though it be an easie thing, at least as I imagine to inculcate a horrour and dread of this unsuffe∣rable Domination, it is not so easie to teach the means to avoid it; con∣sidering, as I have already said, that all the Princes of the 
Empire
 seem to conspire to lay poor subju∣gated 
Germany
 in Fetters, at Her Feet. For is it not a thing that would move both Pity and Indig∣nation at the same time, to see that at a time when every one should labour their utmost, to withstand such an encroaching Violence, they daily strive to enlarge and support her Power? For what may they be said to think, who went about to Elect the Bishop of 
Cologne,
 or ra∣ther of 
Strasburgh
 to the Bishoprick of 
Munster?
 do they not know that

 they are both entirely devoted to the Interest of 
France?
 Or if 
Mon∣sieur
 of 
Cologne
 should chance to o∣pen his Eyes, 
Monsieur
 of 
Strasburgh
 has such an Ascendant over him; that he would still prevail over him to continue in his 
Blindness?
 Do they not know, that if 
Monsieur
 of 
Cologne
 be a lover of 
Peace, Monsieur
 of 
Stras∣burg
 affects nothing so much as 
War?
 Do they not know, that it was by the perswasions of the 
Deceased Arch∣bishop
 of 
Cologne,
 and the defunct Bishop of 
Strasburgh,
 that 
France
 so furiously invaded the United Pro∣vinces; and that to increase the Power of their Successors, no less passionately enclined to enslave 
Eu∣rope,
 they have the same Repute, the same Inclinations, the same De∣signs with the Deceased? as ha∣ving the same Blood in their Veins,

 and the same Souls in their Bodies? And yet when they saw into what a Precipice the 
Deceased
 had plung'd all 
Germany,
 as if they had quite forgot what was past, they would needs put the same Power into the Hands of their 
Nephews
 to Execute those things, which the Uncles had only in their Wills to do. The one already has surrendred the Capital City of his Bishoprick into the Hands of the 
French;
 and they would have the other to deliver up the rest of 
Germany,
 which is already suf∣ficiently captivated by their Trea∣chery. They would in a word tie up the 
Hollanders
 Hands, by the Vi∣cinity of a new Enemy, and by that means enchain the rest of 
Eu∣rope,
 whose 
hopes
 depend upon 'em.


But let us conclude a discourse which 'tis to be feared will do but

 little good, in regard that all the World is of that disposition; as not to love to be too nakedly told the Truth. So that as much as 
France
 may be offended with me for disco∣vering her Maxims and Policies, as much will others bear me ill will for reprehending their Weakness and Blindness. Yet I cannot for∣bear from saying this, with the ha∣zard of what ever they may think, that they make themselves Accom∣plices in all the 
Enterprizes
 of 
France,
 if they do not put an end to those differences that have so long kept them in Dis-union. For what can we say more? For one strives to invade 
Lubec,
 another 
Pomeraenia,
 others make head against them, while on the other side a Potent E∣nemy minds nothing more then to bring them altogether under his

 subjection. They will not permit one Neighbour to grow more pow∣erful then another, but the never consider that there is an Enemy approaching, who not contented to have encreased his Dominions by large Conquests, will never be satisfied with being no more then their Neighbour, agreeable to what is said by the 
Author
 of a 
late Pasquil
 upon the present condition of 
Eu∣rope.
 For when he speaks of the 
United Provinces,
 he brings them in saying, That they will not have the Prince of 
Orange
 Reign over them; to which answer is made, That they 
Act
 like 
Fools
 and 
Blindmen;
 they are afraid lest the 
Dog
 should bite 'em, but ne'r mind the 
Wolf
 who is ready to devour 'em. Thus the 
Northern
 Princes perceive that 
Dane∣mark


 would fain joyn 
Hamborough
 and 
Su∣beck
 to the 
Crown;
 but they do not see that 
France
 will not only joyn to her 
Crown,
 not only both those Ci∣ties, but their own 
Territories
 them∣selves, if they do not 
Unite
 to hin∣der Her. They find that the 
Mar∣quiss
 of 
Brandenburgh
 has a design upon 
Pomerania,
 from whence he believes himself Excluded 
contrary
 to 
Reason,
 but they do not observe, that while they oppose the Enlarge∣ment of 
His Dominion,
 another en∣creases his Power so fast, that they run the hazard of being totally swallowed up by his Oppression. What remedy then against so many Mischiefs, but to forget the 
Old Quar∣rel,
 and to begin a new one. But first it behoves 'em to banish from 
their Councils
 those 
Treacherous Souls,


 who having crept into the favour of their Princes, reward 'em with continual Treasons for their kind∣nesses. They must give ear to none but their old Servants, whose Fide∣lity they have so often experienc'd that it would be an injury to sus∣pect 'em. For in the age we live in, we ought to distrust all the World, considering the general Corruption that shews it self every day; For had not 
Strasburgh
 been free to this day, had she had no o∣other then Persons of Fidelity with∣in her Bosom? But let us here I be∣seech ye consider and admire the differences between the Services that 
France
 receives from her Sub∣jects, and that which other States receive from theirs, which are in the service of 
France.
 I have shew∣ed

 ye before, how 
Boisdavid
 and 
Brignant
 banish'd and proscrib'd as they are, notwithstanding serve as spies, the one in the Court of 
Bran∣denburgh,
 the other in the Court of 
Zell.
 I find I have shewed ye be∣fore that their Fidelity ought to have been little Credited by those Princes; but now let us on the o∣ther side see why the Fidelity of Count 
Hasfield,
 born a Subject to the King of 
Sweden,
 should be sus∣pected by the Prince his Master.


Every own knows his Birth, and it would be superfluous to speak of it here, were it not to tell ye, that his Father being a 
French Man,
 and his Mother a 
French Woman,
 'tis no wonder he retains the nature of a 
French Man
 himself. Nevertheless there is this to be said against him,

 that after he had been born in 
Swe∣den,
 and raised from nothing by the favour of the King, all other 
Ob∣ligations
 ought to have given place; for that, what was a Vertue in his Father was a Crime in Him. Now who could ever dream without having an enmity to his person, that while 
France
 treats the King his Master after so gentile a man∣ner, that he should conspire the slavery of 
Germany?
 and yet was it not he that made so many Jour∣neys to 
Strasburgh,
 where he had more advantage to treat then o∣thers, by reason of his familiarity with the Language, and for that he was least suspected? Is not this he that kept so many Cabals in 
Swe∣den?
 where he knew the Great Per∣sonages were discontented, by rea∣son

 that the King has taken from them sundry great profits, which they enjoyed rather by the Profusi∣on then Liberality of his 
Predeces∣sors?
 I only call the great Persons to Witness these things, and whe∣ther it be not likewise true, that at a drinking bout, where there were about seven or eight in Company, one of the Gang said to the rest, that if 
Hasfield
 were to be belei∣ved they would soon make a 
Tecke∣ley
 among themselves. However it be, he cannot say but that 
France
 has recompenc'd him very well for his good Service. For besides that he receives very considerable Pen∣sions and large Presents, She has advanced all his Family: He has two Brothers, of which the one is suddainly to be a Bishop, the other

 an Abbot, the King having promi∣sed them, who never fails of his Word, unless it be that which he and his Ministers call 
Word of State.
 He has also two other Brothers, of which the one is at 
Hamborough,
 em∣ploy'd by the King of 
France,
 the worthy Brother of Monsieur 
Has∣field,
 that is to say, one as ready as himself to sell 
Germany,
 if it were in his Power, and the other in 
Swe∣den,
 who gives Intelligence of all that passes there; besides all those other Noble Gentlemen there, the Son of Monsieur 
Bidal
 a Merchant, the famous Bankrupt whom 
Bolleau
 has not failed to paint forth in his Satyrs, though he was lately com∣manded by an express order of the 
Court,
 to leave that passage out in in his next 
Edition.
 For Monsieur

 
Hasfield
 performing so many re∣markable Exploits, to render his Name immortal, it is but just to deface the Monuments of his Infa∣my.


The way then to prevent so ma∣ny Abuses, is to imitate the Exam∣ple of 
France
 at this day; for she does not only confiscate the Goods of such as betake themselves to the Service of other Princes, but she always prohibits them under strict Penalties and corporal punishment, to go abroad. Nevertheless if she shews her self indulgent to any, it is easily thence to be infer'd; they only serve as spies in the Courts of those Princes that employ them; which is too serious a Truth.


Let us then conclude, that so long as there is no order taken to

 prevent these abuses, it is impossi∣ble we should ever prosper; but that 
France
 on the other side will have all the Advantages she can desire. For how is it possible that any un∣dertaking of ours should be 
Crown'd
 with happy Success, of which the 
Enemy
 has 
Intelligence
 long before it be put in Execution. To this let us add, that if it will not suffice for a Prince to distrust his own Mini∣sters, or to change them, let him be himself his own 
Minister,
 as one that may be assur'd that if there be one Person in his 
Council
 who is 
Tem∣tation-proof,
 there are hundreds that cannot resist the 
Golden Charms.
 And let him consider that if he himself as frequently now adays it happens will suffer himself to be purchased by him that offers most, his Mini∣sters

 may well do the same, who have more need of Money then he has.


There might be something also said touching the Remedy to be ap∣plied for prevention of these Mis∣chiefs, with which we find our selves at this day overwhelm'd. But in regard I can say no more then what other People have said before me, I had rather be silent, then to make too many repetitions in vain, and for the most part ra∣ther Speculative then Real. For when I consider what I have read in so many Authors, and heard in so many places, that it behoves all the Protestants to unite together, since the Catholicks are so negli∣gent, to oppose themselves against the common Ruin, may not I con∣clude,

 that it is much more easie to discourse in this manner, then probable to see the Effect of such advice. For how is it possible that the Protestants should singly un∣dertake a War against 
France,
 when the Catholicks keep such a strict Watch upon them. We find at this day an apparent example of the Catholick designs, by which it is easie for us to judge how little Reliance there is upon the 
French
 Protestants in 
Silesia,
 and other ad∣joyning Provinces, where they are reduced to that misery, that they have more need of our Assistance. But they had rather the whole Em∣pire should perish, then remit any thing of their Cruelty.




The House of 
Austria,
 which is maliciously incensed to our Destru∣ction, does not perceive the heavy Hand of God upon her for so many Crimes, for which she is accomp∣table to his Justice in respect of us, provoking still the same Justice by new transgressions, in contempt of Heavenly Mercy. Nor does she perceive that the Authors of all these violent Councels, I mean the Jusuits do not advice these things but for their own Interest. She is resolved to sacrifice the rest of the Empire to them, as she has already sacrificed a good part. Neverthe∣less let no man believe that what I have said proceeds from any natu∣ral Aversion to them, so natural to those of my Religion. I protest before God, that I bear malice to

 no Man; and that I would not im∣pute to them the least of our Mise∣ries, but that I find that none of the honest and moderate party of their Religion, have any greater affecti∣on for them than my self. 'Tis well known that it was their Hun∣ger after the Estates of these four 
Hungarian
 Lords, whose 
Heads
 the Emperor caused to be struck off, rather to satisfie their urgent 
Impor∣tunities
 then for any Crime (unless yo will say their zeal for their 
Re∣ligion
 was a Crime) that was the main occasion of 
sheding
 their 
Blood.
 But seeing all that I could say, would as little prevail as what o∣thers have said before me, it will be better to make an end, and to confess that all our Miseries are at this day reduc'd to such a 
Condition,


 as well as the 
Calamities
 of 
Germany,
 that our 
Preservation
 is only to be ex∣pected from 
God
 alone.










The 
Speech
 of Monsieur ZIEROW∣SKI, the 
Emperors
 Embassador in 
Poland.
 Spoken in the Royal Palace before his Majesty of 
Poland,
 and in the Presence of the Princes, Noblemen and Embassadors at that Court, at 
Tavoravia,
 the 6th. of 
October, 1682.


Most Great King,


AMongst other Books, I have hit upon that of the Life and Exploits of Cardinal 
Commendon,
 who was sent to this Court by the Pope, with the Qua∣lity of extraordinary 
Legate
 in the Empire of 
Sigismond,
 and Reign of 
Henry de Valois:
 I have observed in it, that it was that Cardinal's Maxim, Never to answer but with an affected Silence and Contempt,

 to all that his Ememies could do or say against him. Without doubt, in his Time, the State of Affairs, the Customs and Spirits were very different from what they now are; at least a long experience has made me judge them very different; and I know I cannot, without great disadvantage, conceal or connive at a thing that very much troubles me. I have understood that the French King's Minister's, published some days ago certain Letters, which brought, as it were, assured Testimonies, that His Imperial Ma∣jesties Envoyes only Business, with the 
Ottoman
 Court, was to endea∣vour, by all possible means, to turn the 
Turkish
 Armies against 
Poland.


There is no Body but sees, and your Majesty must needs perceive,

 how injurious this is to the 
Empire;
 and to what end it is done. They give this out to disunite two King∣doms; both which, at this present Conjuncture of Affairs, have their chief Interest in being firmly uni∣ted. But the Letters took not so great an effect as they expected. The Spirits of this Court, were not so credulous as to believe them. They are too well satisfied in 
Po∣land,
 of the Piety and Affection of those of the House of 
Austria;
 to think that the Emperor, my 
Master,
 gives his Embassadors such base and unworthy Commissions. There is no body here that can doubt that his Imperial Majesty, would be as sensi∣ble of the loss of 
Poland
 as of 
Hunga∣ry,
 since it is as much his Interest to preserve the one as the other.




I come not hither, great King, to tell you what through my Aver∣sion, I could publish upon little Rumours that have been spread a∣mong us: I bring your 
Majesty
 those things, which I can beyond all di∣spute, produce before the whole World, as the true 
Originals
 of 
Let∣ters
 and 
Answers,
 which the most Christian 
Kings
 Embassador, Mon∣sieur 
Du Vernay Boucauld,
 who is here present, has writ to Count 
Teckeley,
 the Head of the 
Malecontents,
 or received from him. These will evidently discover to your Majesty, what Affairs Monsieur 
Du Vernay
 has Treated about, with so much Secresie and Circumspection with 
Count Teckeley;
 and the reason he had so cautiously to conceal from you, the Commission he had in this 
King∣dom.




I humbly entreat your Majesty to remember how earnestly I in∣treated you, to remove the Sieur 
Du Vernay
 from your 
Court
 and 
Do∣minions,
 as a man pernicious to the 
Empire
 and 
Poland.
 You would have, great King, invincible Proofs and Testimonies of what I related; Here they are such as you will wish for, and I am perswaded they will be sufficient to make you judge the speedy departure of Monsieur 
Du Vernay,
 out of your Kingdom, ve∣ry necessary. But I fear, troubling your Majesty with a long 
Discourse;
 I pass by a thousand things which I could add; this Memorial is enough: To you I present it with all imagi∣nable respect.








A 
Memorial
 presented to the King of 
Poland,
 by Monsieur 
Zierowsky, the
 Emperor's Resident. Which was read in the Presence of his Ma∣jesty of 
Poland,
 and before the Princes and Ministers of his Court; at 
Tavo∣ravia,
 the 6th. of 
October, 1682.


SInce the lact 
Memorial,
 which I had the Honour to present to your Majesty, I have endeavoured, according to the Advice of the Il∣lustrious Lords of the Senate, to furnish my self with some piece that might evidently appear what Cor∣respondence the 
French
 King's A∣gents have in your Kingdom with Count 
Tekeley,
 Head of the 
Male∣contents
 in 
Hungary.
 These want∣ed also to inform you, what Bar∣gains

 and Agreements passed be∣tween them, which, as I said, tend to the breaking off the Peace and Treaties, that are between your Majesty and the Emperor, my Ma∣ster. You could not easily be infor∣med of it, from any but my self. I know the 
French
 King's Ministers daily assured your Majesty, that they had a hand in no such thing; and that we accused them falsely. And the 
French
 would no longer be suspected to have any ill 
Design
 a∣gainst the 
Empire,
 after the 
Decla∣ration
 the 
French
 King had made, at the raising the 
Bloccade
 of 
Luxem∣bergh.
 His most 
Christian
 Majesty would inform all 
Europe,
 how he be∣haved himself in that occasion; and they were careful to carry his De∣claration to all the Courts of the

 chief 
Christian Princes.
 The 
French
 King plausibly declares, that having been informed of the Designs which are carrying on in the 
East
 against the 
Empire,
 he would put nothing in execution which might hinder his 
Imperial Majesty,
 and the most au∣gust House of 
Austria,
 from oppo∣sing the 
Turk
 with all their Forces, and providing for the common good of 
Christendom.


This could by no means allow your 
Majesty
 to believe, that the 
French
 were in League with the 
Male-Contents
 and 
Turks;
 and that they contributed to the taking and plundering the Towns of 
Hunga∣ry;
 for that appeared to be quite contrary to such fair 
Declarations;
 but God the Defender and Reven∣ger of 
Christians,
 has ordered those

 things to fall into my hands, which I lay at the foot of your Majesties Throne; and which I lay before the Eyes of the whole 
World.
 These are the Sieur 
Du Vernay
's Letters, and Correspondence with Count 
Tekeley;
 which you will find dia∣metrically opposite to those Decla∣rations, so worthy the piety and ge∣nerosity of the most 
Christian King.


I have made use of no evil pra∣ctice for the obtaining these 
Letters:
 I have not, though I could have done it, so much as employed any Body to observe the 
French.
 And to tell you all, I got these Letters by the means of the Steward of the most Illustrious Lord 
Stadnick
's E∣state. The Sieur 
Du Vernay,
 after having long importuned the 
Monks
 of a Monastry of St. 
Basil,
 went

 also to importune the Steward, who is 
Castellan
 at 
Premislaw.
 So much he did, that he stirred up the Gen∣tlemans anger against himself, and so consequently he became my friend, and has ever since been ve∣ry favourable to my Intentions. This 
Castellan,
 some days ago, stopt certain 
Hungarians
 coming back from 
Nimiravia,
 whither they went to see the Sieur 
Du Vernay;
 im∣mediately he ordered them to be brought to me, with the Letters he found about them. I presently took care to convey them to the 
Emperor
 my Master's 
Territories;
 sending at the same time the Letters, to the end that all the World might judg, whe∣ther I had not just 
Cause
 to suspect, that the Sieur 
Du Vernay
 exceeded his 
Masters
 Orders.




Certainly, this Agent, this Mini∣ster, this 
Spy,
 this 
Embassador,
 I know not what to call him, but I mean Monsieur 
Du Vernay,
 has committed a great Outrage against all 
Christen∣dom.
 Against the 
Emperor,
 in fomen∣ting and contriving what he has a∣gainst him. Against your Majesty, in entertaining a 
Commerce
 so unwor∣thy, so pernicious, and for so long a time, without your knowledg, and in your Kingdom, as if he had been at home. I must add, for the Interest of your Kingdom; that this 
Conduct
 has given the 
World
 occasion to be∣lieve, that the 
Polanders
 were blind enough, not to see the dangers their Neighbours made them fear, and that they would themselves drive the 
Ponyard
 to their own Breast, in permitting the Sieur 
Du Vernay
 to

 live amongst them. His 
Proceeding
 will, without doubt, appear very in∣jurious to the 
French King;
 for that Posterity may judg and believe, that the great King, 
Lewis
 the XIV, authorized or commanded, what the Sieur 
Du Vernay,
 his 
Agent
 did in his Name.


Your Majesty will not take it ill, that we have discovered to the As∣semblies at 
Francfort
 and 
Ratisbone;
 the Famous Exploits of the 
French,
 with the Turks and Rebels of 
Hun∣gary,
 in your Kingdom, which for so many Ages has been closely uni∣ted with the August House of 
Au∣stria;
 and has always acknowledged its own Interest, to preserve 
Hun∣gary
 to the Empire, thinking it im∣possible for 
Poland
 to subsist if 
Hun∣gary
 shall fall.




It is now a year, that the Sieur 
Du Vernay
 travels up and down several parts of your Majesties Dominions, on the 
Borders
 of 
Hungary.
 He always pretends his Masters, as if we could see that 
Dantzick
 or 
Rogiomont,
 which are the Places the 
French
 come through, were not nearer and more proper to receive what Orders the 
French
 King would send, but he stays there to observe the nearer, the Af∣fairs of 
Hungary:
 It may be also, to be in a better condition to give Count 
Tekeley Joy,
 and to get the reputation with him, of the progress the 
Turks
 by his means, might make in that Country


I desire your Majesty, That after you have seen the 
Memorial,
 I pre∣sent; and after you are convinced of all the Arts the 
French
 have used in

 this 
Kingdom,
 you will be pleased to order the Seiur 
Du Vernay
 to depart your Dominions, since he abuses his Employments to the prejudice of all Christendom; and renders himself unworthy the protection the Law of Nations allows.


You may do so much the more justly, great King, because the Ro∣man Catholick Church, your Mo∣ther, esteems them as Excommuni∣cated Persons, who side with Infi∣dels, whether it be carrying them Arms, or treating with them.


The Seiur 
Du Vernay
 has drawn this upon his own head, and if he is punished according to his deserts the most Christian King will banish him his Kingdom, for exeeding his 
Orders,
 & engaging his Master's Ho∣nor and Reputation. In fine, he has

 committed his Vilanies in the 
French
 King's Name, and broke his Ma∣sters word; acting in all things con∣trary to the 
observance
 of it, which if it should fail in the world, could be no where found but in the Mouth of a King or Prince.


I doubt not, great King, but all my pressing, reiterated and just In∣stances, will at last take effect. The Alliances and Treaties that are be∣tween this Kingdom and the Em∣pire, require it from your Majesty. And I also, with a most profound respect, beg to be admitted to the honour of some part of your Affe∣cti










A
 Letter 
from Monsieur
 Du Vernay, 
to Count
 Emery Tekeley.


My Lord,


I Received with great joy the Let∣ters, you did me the honour to write to me, from the Camp before 
Filleck,
 enclosed in the Pacquets of our Embassadors at 
Constantinople;
 nevertheless, 
I
 was a little surprized that you should seal them before he had seen them. 
I
 wonder also you said nothing about the Siege of 
Filleck.
 However, 
I
 doubt not but that place, by this time is in your power. Monsieur 
Jaygel, I
 be∣lieve, knows by my last Letters, that 
I
 have several times endeavou∣red to send him what 
I
 promised and let him have what 
I
 have recei∣ved,

 but 
I
 always wanted an oppor∣tunity. When you send any of your People to me, order them not to come to my House but at night, to the end we may do our business without any bodies knowledge. But what I most earnestly desire is, that above all things, they take care not to follow the Road that goes directly from 
Tavoravia
 to 
Nimiro∣via.
 For here are several Polish Gentlemen, who by the most Se∣rene King of 
Poland
's Order, search, visit and detain all strangers that pass. The safest way in my opi∣nion is, that they leave 
Premislaw
 and 
Toreslavia
 on the right hand, and follow the Road that leads to 
San∣domiria,
 least they be seen to enter 
Nimirovia,
 where I am surrounded with Spies. I recommend the En∣closed

 to you; and desire you to send them according to their Dire∣ctions, by the first opportunity. I will take the same care in all things you shall be pleased to command me. I am most cordially,


Sir,


Your most zealous Servant,
 Du Vernay Boucald.


Nimirovia,
 
Sept.
 the 22d. 1682.






The
 Superscription 
was thus,


To the most Illustrious Lord, Count 
Emery Tekeley,
 Lord of 
Kesmark
 and 
Arve,
 General of the 
Hungarian
 Army, that fights for it's Country. 


THE 
Audience
 being ended, His 
Majesty
 of 
Poland
 said, he was convinced of the 
French Correspon∣dence
 with the 
Male-Contents.
 He shew'd himself very angry that the thing had been conceal'd from him. Next day some of the 
Chief Officers
 of his 
Court,
 had Orders to go and command the Sieur 
Du Vernay,
 im∣mediately to depart the 
Kingdom.
 He said, he would obey his 
Majesties Or∣der;
 but that he earnestly desired those 
Gentlemen
 to give him some

 days, that he might take the 
Coach
 of 
Transylvania.
 On the other side, the 
Emperor
's 
Resident
 used all dili∣gence, and with great Success; for Monsieur 
Du Vernay
's Letter carrier called 
Kelemeschi,
 returned to 
Nimi∣rovia,
 before his departure. This 
Courier
 came with those whom 
Te∣keley
 sent to the Sieur 
Du Vernay,
 with his 
Letters;
 and those of his great 
Agent
 and 
Confident Jaygel.
 These 
Couriers
 were seized, and the 
Letters
 they had intercepted, were partly writ in 
Cyphers,
 which you will here find interpreted.






A
 Letter 
from Count
 TECKELEY to Monsieur 
Du
 VERNAY.


SIR,


I Doubt not, but you have made much of Monsieur 
Valentine Ne∣messani
 my Envoy. He has always been faithful to me, and very true to my Interest. The Recommen∣dations you gave him touching the Affairs he communicated with you, will without doubt be of great Im∣portance to him, with the most Christian King. I am beholding to you for all you have done for him, and shall acknowledg it as occasion serves: It is time I should inform you, of the present State of my 
Affairs.
 After I had taken 
Cassovia,
 and entred some 
Forts
 about it; I

 went with the 
Visier
 of 
Budas
's 
Troops,
 to attack the 
Famous
 Fort of 
Filleck:
 The 
Inhabitants
 refused, at first, to put themselves under my 
Protection;
 but after a Fortnights Siege, they came to beg 
I
 would admit them to capitulate; 
I
 gran∣ted them what they asked; which was, that the 
Garrison,
 and what o∣ther 
People
 there was, should go out, carrying with them as much as they could upon their Backs: Then 
I
 raised the 
Fort,
 in sight of the 
Imperial Army,
 which was hard by in the 
Mountains.
 As 
I
 am now in∣formed, it is marched away; and having sacked the Town of 
Vieux∣sols
 and other 
Places
 retires very ha∣stily. 
I
 design to follow the 
Imperi∣alists,
 and drive them far off, to re∣store my 
Country
 to its former Li∣berty.

 At length the 
Emperor
 will be forced to yield by 
Force,
 what we beg as a 
Favour.
 Heaven has com∣miserated my 
Fortune
 indeed some∣what late; but 
I
 also hope, it will draw on a greater and more speedy Vengeance. Sir, 
I
 will take care to inform you of all my other 
Affairs;
 however 
I
 desire you always to stand my 
Friend. I
 am


Sir,


Always ready to serve you,
 EMERY TEKELEY.

A 
Letter
 from Monsieur 
Peter Jaigel,
 Governour of 
Cossovia,
 To Mon∣sieur 
Du Vernay.


SIR,


LAst Wednesday we took and raised 
Filleck;
 where above a 
Thousand Janizaries
 were slain. After∣wards, the 
Visier
 made all the 
Hun∣garians
 that were present, and were under the Prince of 
Transilvania
's Dominion, be brought before our 
Illustrious Count;
 then all the 
Estates
 of the Upper 
Hungary
 being Assem∣bled, Monsieur 
Tekeley
 was Proclai∣med King, and confirmed in that Quality by the 
Great Turk,
 who sent him from the 
Port,
 a Hat instead of a Crown, with a 
Standard
 and 
Scep∣ter.
 After the Ceremony, the 
Count


 very modestly refused the Title of 
King:
 He is satisfyed with that of Prince Regent of 
Hungary:
 His 
Ti∣tles
 are, 
Emericus Thokolius Princeps, ac partium Regni Hungariae Dominus,
 &c. After this Election, the 
Visier
 gave him the best Troops, to pursue at the 
Head
 of the Army, those of the 
Imperialists. Caprara
 having de∣serted the Mountains, pillaged the Towns, and abandoned the Forts 
Vigles
 and 
Zolian,
 and is at last retir'd and has taken his way towards 
Threnezin.
 Sir, we had done some∣thing more, but we have not recei∣ved what you promis'd us, and without that supply, we are forced to proceed gently in our business. Monsieur 
Nemessani
 is gone to treat of Affairs, at the 
French King
's 
Court.
 He needs your 
Instructions;
 we have

 order'd him in all things, to Act to your Honour. We will very sud∣denly send you an Express; I beg of you for God's sake, make him up as large a Sum as you can. I always remain, as I ought,


SIR,


Your most obliged Servant,
 Peter Jaigel.

Sept.

 Du Vernay Boucauld, 
Embassa∣dor Extraordinary from the French King.




After the 
Emperors Resident
 had the second time produced these 
Letters,
 and the 
Days
 appointed were expired, his 
Majesty
 of 
Poland
 sent word to the Marquiss 
de Vitry,
 the 
French Embassador
 in 
Poland,
 to cause the Sieur 
Du Vernay,
 immediately to retire, that he was weary of hea∣ring daily of his new 
Designs.
