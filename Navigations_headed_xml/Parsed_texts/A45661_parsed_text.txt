THE DEFENCE OF THE 
SCOTS Settlement
 AT DARIEN, ANSWER'D, Paragraph by Paragraph. By 
Philo-Britan.

London

Westminster,

THE DEFENCE OF THE 
SCOTS Settlement
 AT DARIEN, ANSWER'D.


WHEN this Pamphlet came first to my Hands, these bold and unaccountable In∣sinuations, with which I found it stuff'd up from the very beginning to the end, invited me to make some Reflections upon it, for my own Diversion, and the Use of some few of those whom I knew to be both my Friends, and con∣stant Adherers to the present Government in 
England;
 not questioning but that some more able Pen than mine would take this Task in Hand, and convince the World of the unreasonableness of such an Under∣taking by a private Hand, which amounts to no less than charging both His Majesty, and the present 
English
 Government with Injustice, and a mistake of their own Interest; as will more evidently appear out of the following Sheets.



The Dedication, which if rightly considered, is nothing else but an Introduction to the rest, is to make the World believe, that the 
English
 stand much indebted to the 
Scots,
 for suffering themselves to be united with them under one Head, and cannot discharge this Obligation, unless they maintain them in their present Settlement of 
Darien,
 which if they don't do, they must expect to be treated as an Un∣grateful and Unjust People, by the 
Scots,
 who, if we will take this Gentleman's Word for it, are power∣ful enough, either by themselves, or with the Assi∣stance of their Allies, to reduce us to a more pliable Temper.


That this is the main design of the Dedication, as well as the whole Treatise, will sufficiently appear to any one who will take the Pains carefully to pe∣ruse them; for tho' he is pleased to tell His Majesty at the beginning of the Dedication, that his Design is to vindicate the Settlement of the 
Scots
 in 
Darien,
 against the Aspersions of the 
Spanish
 Memorial; yet, when not long after he says, That those cannot be look'd upon as Friends to His Majesty's Dignity as King of 
Scots▪
 who call in question what he en∣acts in the Parliament of 
Scotland;
 I say, these Words are an undeniable Proof, that the whole is more levell'd against 
England
 than 
Spain.
 I will not pretend to make particular Reflections upon each Passage here, because I shall have occasion to do it hereafter, but I cannot forbear to take notice of that unaccountable Arrogance which has emboldened some of our Modern Writers to foster the Inventions of their own Brains, and their speculative Politicks upon the World, under the Cloak of the Royal Authority: Will not Posterity stand amazed when they see a Person, whose Faith has not only been call'd in question, but also condemn'd by a legal Sentence, to cover his Zeal, Self-Interest, and pri∣vate Passion, under the Veil of His Sacred Majesty's Name? But we will proceed to the Book it self, which begins thus.






DEFENCE.


The Heads propos'd to be insisted upon in the following Sheets, are,
 The Legality of the 
Scots
 Esta∣blishment: The Advantage or Disadvantage that may redound from it to 
England:
 Whether the 
Scots
 with∣out the Assistance of the 
English,
 may be able to main∣tain their footing in 
America;
 and what may probably be the Consequences if the 
Scots
 should be oppos'd therein by the 
English,
 and miscarry in the Ʋndertaking.






ANSWER.


These s
veral Heads give us sufficiently to under∣stand, what I mentioned just now; to wit, That the chief aim of this Author was against the 
Eng∣lish;
 and that what is said in relation to the 
Spani∣ards,
 is only a Preparative to the rest, as will more plainly appear out of the following Sheets. Upon the first Head he says further thus:






DEFENCE.


The chief Objections against the Legality of their Establishment, arise from the Memorial delivered in against it to the King, by the Ambassador Extraor∣dinary of 
Spain, May
 3: 1699. 
O. S.
 as follows:






ANSWER.


As these Animadversions were intended at first only for a private use, so I had not the opportunity of informing my self, whether the following 
Spanish
 Memorial be Authentick in all its Parts or not, which therefore I insert here barely upon our Author's Credit, as it is extant in his Defence, &c.




THE Ʋnder-Subscriber, Ambassador Extraordinary from His Catholick Majesty, finds himself oblig'd by express Orders, to represent to Your Majesty, that the King his Master having receiv'd Information from diffe∣rent places, and last of all from the Governour of 
Ha∣vana,
 of the Insult and Attempt of some 
Scots
 Ships,


equipp'd with Men and other things requisite, who design to settle themselves in His Majesty's Soveraign Demains in 
America,
 and particularly the Province of 
Darien,
 His Majesty receiv'd those Advices with very much Discontent, and looks upon the same as a Rupture of the Alliance be∣twixt the Two Crowns, (which His Majesty hath observed hitherto, and always observes very Religiously, and from which so many Advantages and Profits have resulted both to Your Majesty and Your Subjects) as a Conse∣quence of which good Correspondence, His Majesty did not expect such sudden Insults and Attempts by Your Majesty's Subjects, and that too in a time of Peace, without pretext, (or any cause) in the very Heart of his Demains.


All that the King desires, is, That this may be re∣presented to Your Majesty, and that Your Majesty may be acquainted, that he is very sensible of such Hostilities and unjust Procedures, against which His Majesty will take such Measures as he thinks convenient.


Given at 
London,
 
May
 13/3. 1699.




It were easie (says the Author of the Defence of the 
Scot
's Settlement) to make proper Remarks up∣on the Weakness, Insolence and Ingratitude of this Memorial, but it is not worth while; all the World knows what the Crown of 
Spain
 owes to His Ma∣jesty of 
Great Britain;
 and therefore a more civil Application might reasonably have been expected to a Prince who had not only sav'd the 
Netherlands,
 but prevented his Catholick Majesty from being in∣sulted on his Throne at 
Madrid.
 But these things we pass over, and come to the chief Point in the Memorial, which is, 
That the
 Scots 
have posted them∣selves in the King of
 Spain
's Demains in
 America, 
con∣trary to the Alliance betwixt the two Crowns.
 If this be prov'd to be false, then the Cause of the great Com∣plaint ceases, and His Majesty of 
Great Britain
 hath reason to demand Satisfaction for the Affront offe∣red thereby to his Justice and Sovereignty.



To prove the Falshood of the Allegation▪ That the Province of 
Darien
 is part of the King of 
Spain
's Demains: It is positively denied by the 
Scots,
 who challenge the 
Spaniards
 to prove their Right to the said Province, either by 
Inheritance, Marriage, Do∣nation, Purchase, Reversion, Surrender, Possession,
 or 
Conquest;
 which being the only Titles by which they or any other People can Claim a Right to those or any other Dominions, if the 
Spaniards
 cannot make out their Right by these or any of these, their Claim must of consequence be null and void.






ANSWER.


It is a most surprising thing to see the Author Charge one of the greatest Kings in 
Europe,
 who thinks himself touch'd in the most sensible part of his Sovereignty, with Insolence and Ingratitude against His 
Britannick
 Majesty▪ when he, who owns himself a private Person, and his Subject, uses so many reflecting Expressions throughout the whole Treatise, upon the 
English
 Government. That 
Spain
 owes in a great measure its preservation to His Majesty of 
Great Britain,
 is scarce disputed by any, but he must be but indifferently vers'd in the Politicks of 
Europe,
 who does not know, That the Councils of Princes are sway'd more by the Considerations of their present Interest, than by the Remembrance of pass'd Obligations. Amongst all those Titles which he Assigns for the 
Spaniards
 to prove their Claim by, the Three last seem to be the most likely to do their Business; and supposing they should be able, by either one of them, or per∣haps all Three together, to prove their Claim, What will then become of our Author's bold Chal∣lenge? But let us hear what he further says upon this Head.








DEFENCE.


It is Evident, (says he) That the 
Spaniards
 can∣not pretend a Title to that Country by Inheritance, Marriage, or the Donation of Prince and People; and as to Conquest it would be ridiculous to al∣ledge it, since the 
Dariens
 are in actual possession of their Liberty, and were never subdued, nor re∣ceiv'd any 
Spanish
 Governour or Garrison amongst them. Nay, they w
re so far from it, that 
Wafer, Dampier,
 and others that have wrote of that Coun∣try, do all agree, that they mortally hate the 
Spa∣niards,
 were in War with them, and that the 
Spa∣niards
 had no Commerce with those 
Indians,
 nor Command over them in all the North-side of the 
Isthmus
 a little beyond 
Porto-Bello.
 Captain 
Sharp
 in the Journal of his Expedition, published in Cap∣tain 
Hacke
's Collection of Voyages, gives an Ac∣count, That in 1680, he landed at 
Golden Island
 with 330 Men; and being join'd by one of the 
Darien
 Princes, whom they call'd 
Emperor;
 and another to whom they gave the Title of 
King Golden Cap,
 with some hundreds of their Men, took 
Sancta Maria,
 attempted 
Panama,
 and made Prize of se∣veral 
Spanish
 Ships; which is the more remarkable, because Captain 
Sharp
 was afterwards tried in 
Eng∣land
 for Robbery and Piracy on this very Account, but acquitted, because of his Commission from those 
Darien
 Princes; which is a plain Demonstration, that the Government of 
England
 did then look up∣on 
Darien
 to be no way subject to 
Spain,
 whatever some who are Enemies to the 
Scots,
 do now say against the Legality of their Settlement in that Country. This same Expedition against the 
Spa∣niards,
 by the assistance of the 
Darien Indians,
 is confirm'd by Mr. 
Dampier
 in his Introduction to his 
New Voyage round the World.
 And the Bishop of 
Chiapa,
 a Prelate of their own, in his 
Relation of the
 Spanish 
Voyages and Cruelties in the
 West-Indies,



Pag.
 217. owns, 
That the 
Spaniards
 had no Title to the 
Americans,
 as their Subjects, by right of Inheritance, Purchase, or Conquest.
 


We have likewise a large Account, and a full Confirmation of the War and perpetual Enmity betwixt the 
Dariens
 and 
Spaniards
 in the History of the Buccaneers of 
America, Vol.
 2. 
Part
 4. wrote by 
Basil Ringrose,
 who was one of their Company. There he informs us, That the 
Indians
 of 
Darien,
 and the 
Spaniards,
 are commonly at War with one another; and that the Buccaneers were invited into that Country, and join'd by the 
Darien
 Princes, Captain 
Andreas,
 Captain 
Antonio,
 and the King of 
Darien,
 who assisted them in the taking of 
Sancta Maria,
 and their attempt upon 
Panama;
 and the King, whose Daughter the 
Spaniards
 had stole away, promised to joyn the Buccaneers with 50000 Men. This is the more remarkable, because those very Princes or their Successors are now in League with the 
Scots,
 and have joyfully receiv'd them into their Country. So that it is the strangest position that can be put upon any Nation, and one of the most audacious Affronts that ever was put upon so Great a Prince as K. 
William,
 for the 
Spaniards
 to pretend a Right to 
Darien,
 and accuse him of a Breach of the Peace, because a Colony of his Subjects have settled themselves there: when it is so well known to the World, that the Crown of 
Spain
 has no manner of Title to that Province.


Then as to any Claim by virtue of Possession, the 
Spaniards
 have not the least ground of Plea: All they can alledge on this Head, is, That they were once admitted by the Consent of Captain 
Di∣ego,
 another of the 
Darien
 Princes, to work on some Golden Mines within 15 Leagues, or there abouts, of the 
Scots
 Settlement. But it is plain that this makes nothing for their purpose. That Prince admitted them only as Labourers, but not as Proprietors; And when they broke the Condi∣tions on which they were admitted, 
viz.
 To allow the 
Dariens
 such 
d such Shar
 of the Product,


they were expell'd again by force; and ever since that time, the 
Dariens
 refuse to have any further Dealings with the 
Spaniards,
 who made themselves odious to them by their Treachery and Insolence: So that Mr. 
Wafter
 tells us, 
Pag.
 133. They allow a distinguishing Mark of Honour to him who has kill'd a 
Spaniard:
 And 
Pag.
 179. That 
Cascata,
 one of the chief of the 
Darien
 Princes, did in his Converse with him, express his Sense and Resent∣ment of the Havock made by the 
Spaniards
 in the West of 
America,
 at their first coming thither.






ANSWER.


Our 
Philo-Calydon,
 as he calls himself, pretends to prove here, That the 
Spaniards
 can lay no Claim to 
Darien
 as a Conquest: His Reasons are; Because they were never subdued; but I would fain ask this Gentleman, how he came to know this? 'Tis possible some of his Countrymen have been told so, by some of the 
Dariens;
 but this will be but a slender Argument against the 
Spaniards.
 It is most unquestionable, that there is much more probability on the 
Spaniards
 side than on the other. For how can it be supposed, that the 
Spaniards,
 who have conquer'd such a vast Tract of 
America,
 and several Plantations there, should not have been able to force a few petty 
Indian-Lords,
 who are en∣closed within their Dominions, to a Submission? His Arguments, by which he would prove them a free People, is much more ridiculous, than the pre∣tended Conquest of the 
Spaniards;
 it being evi∣dent, that a few Cottages, inhabited by a barbarous and unarmed People, headed by many Leaders, resembling the Heads of 
Clans
 in 
Scotland,
 did re∣quire neither a 
Spanish
 Governour nor Garrison. What he alledges concerning the Hatred they bear to the 
Spaniards,
 and their joyning with the Bucca∣neers against them, does not in the least invalidate the Title of 
Spain
 to 
Darien;
 And all what 
Wafer, Dampier,
 and the History of the Buccaneers, says,


upon this Subject, proves no more, than that those Petty 
Indian
 Lords, who formerly, either volunta∣rily or by force, submitted to the 
Spaniards;
 took this opportunity to shake off the 
Spanish
 Yoke, and to Revenge themselves upon their Conquerors; For if they had been in a Condition to make War a∣gainst them without a foreign Assistance, What need had there been for them to call in the Buc∣caneers, and to allow them so large a share in the Booty? Our 
Calidonian
 Gentleman further tells us, That the 
Spaniards
 have no other Plea for Posses∣sion, but what was granted them by one of the 
Darien
 Princes, to Work as Labourers in some Golden Mines: I must confess this is somewhat difficult to be contradicted at so vast a distance, and I would have pass'd by this Point in silence, if 
Pag.
 78. he had not himself furnish'd me with an Argument against his Assertion, where he says: 
That they had been informed by a
 Frenchman, 
who married one of the Natives there, That the
 Spaniards 
have Gold and Silver Mines on the
 Isthmus, 
which they might make themselves Masters of with a
 100 M
n: This, I say, and the Hostilities committed already by the 
Spaniards,
 against the 
Scots
 in their New Set∣tlement, does▪ I think, carry with it a great pro∣bability, that to this day they are not excluded from the Province of 
Darien,
 but remain in actual Possession of so much of that Province, as they think consistent with their own Interest. What he alledges of Captain 
Sharp
's being acquitted in 
Eng∣land,
 by reason of his Commission from one of the 
Darien
 Princes, can in no wise affect the 
Spanish
 Title; for, supposing the Court of 
England
 was at that time not sufficiently inform'd concerning their Pretensions, What detriment could that be to their real Pretensions? If our Author could have given us an instance of a Person who had been acquit∣ted upon the same Account in 
Spain,
 his Argu∣ment would have been of unquestionable Vali∣dity, which bears not the least weight now, at least not in reference to 
Spain.
 But, let us hear


the rest of his Arguments against the 
Spanish
 Title.






DEFENCE.


It remains then that the 
Spaniards
 can lay no other Claim to 
Darien
 but what they plead 
from the Pope's general Grant of
 America, 
its being bounded by their Dominions, and the Treaties with
 England, which shall be consider'd in their Order.


To urge the Pope's Grant amongst Protestants is ridiculous, and amongst Papists themselves but pre∣carious: But admitting it were sufficient to justifie their Title, it is easie to prove that the 
Spaniards
 have forfeited all the Right they can Claim by virtue of that Grant.


The Church of 
Rome
 will not publickly own her Power to grant a Right of Conquest, but in order to propagate the Faith, and not that neither, ex∣cept the Infidel Prince or People be guilty of a Breach of Treaty. So that the Pope's Grant with those Restrictions is so far from establishing the Title of the 
Spaniards,
 that it plainly overthrows it.


That the 
Indians
 were committed to the 
Spaniards
 by Pope 
Alexander
 VI. on condition that they should teach them the Christian Religion, is prov'd by Don 
Bartholomew de las Casas,
 Bishop of 
Chiapa,
 in his 
Ac∣count of the first Voyages and Discoveries made by the
 Spaniards 
in
 America, 
and the Relation of their un∣parallell'd Cruelties, Pag.
 195. and there he likewise owns, 
That by their acquitting themselves so ill of that Commission, they ought to make Resti∣tution of all they have taken from them under this pretext.
 And 
Pag.
 200. he charges them with breach of the Terms prescrib'd by the Apo∣stolical Brief, tho' Queen 
Isabella,
 to whom it was granted, earnestly intreated them in her last Will to keep exactly to it. 
Pag.
 218. he says, That the Title of the King of 
Spain
 to the 
Indians,
 is founded only on the Obligation he had taken upon himself


to instruct them in the true Faith, as appears by the Apostolick Brief: Which they were so far from performing, that instead of converting their Souls, they destroyed their Bodies; having in those early days, 
viz.
 in the time of the Emperor 
Charles
 V. mur
her'd above 40 Millions of them; and took so little care to instruct them in the Christian Religion, that they perfectly obstructed their Conversion, and sold those very Idols that some of the poor People had th
own away with Abhorrence, to others of the 
Indians; Ib.
 P. 194. which, together with their other horrid Impieties, created an Aversion in those poor Infidels for Heaven it self; according to the known Story of 
Hathwey
 an 
Indian
 Prince, 
Ibid.
 Pag. 21. 
Who being fasten'd to a Stake by the 
Spaniards
 in order to be burnt, for no other Crime but in∣deavouring to defend himself and his Subjects a∣gainst their Cruelties, ask'd a Friar that was dis∣coursing to him of Heaven, promising him eter∣nal Happiness there if he would believe; and threatning him with Hell if he did not, whether Heaven was open to the 
Spaniards;
 and being an∣swer'd that it was to such of them as were good, replied immediately, that he would not go thi∣ther for fear of meeting such cruel and wicked Company as they were, but would much rather chuse to go to Hell, where he might he deliver'd from the troublesome sight of such kind of People.
 So that their forfeiture of all Right or Title to 
Da∣rien
 by the Pope's Grant, if it were of any validi∣ty, is plainly demonstrated.






ANSWER.


Our Author takes a great deal of Pains to de∣monstrate, that supposing the Pope's Grant of 
Ame∣rica
 to be valid in its self, they have forfeited the same. I believe there will scarce be any body so void of Humanity, who is acquainted with the most barbarous Cruelties committed by the 
Spani∣ards



against the poor Natives of that Country, as to take upon himself the Defence of them in this Point: But how far this affects their Title is the matter in Question at present. Not to enter upon the Topick here, How far the Miscarriages of Go∣vernours and other Officers, who transgress the Bounds of their Commission, affects the Titles of their Sovereigns. I will only insist upon this Head, which I believe will scarce admit of a Contradiction by any body who has a true insight into the matter; That supposing some of those Cruelties to have been committed by publick Authority, there is no body who can be acknowledg'd a competent Judge of the Forfeiture of the 
Spanish
 Title, but the Pope himself; who, admitted he has a Power to Grant it, must of necessity be the only Person who can Recal it; and till any such thing be done, their Title will stand unshaken upon that bottom, at least on the 
Spani∣ards
 side; whatever our Author may alledge against it out of the Bishop of 
Chiapa,
 whose Authority is in sufficient to maintain his Assertion in this Point, as being only a Bishop under the Jurisdiction of 
Spain;
 and, as being a Church-man, he might as well make use of a Dragoon for a Pilot, as make those of his Profession competent Judges of the Titles of Princes. But let us see further.






DEFENCE.


Their next Plea, is, That 
Darien
 is bounded or inclosed by their Dominions, 
viz.
 By 
Porto-Bello
 and 
Carthagena,
 with their Territories on the North, and 
Panama
 and 
Sancta Maria
 on the South. To this it is answered, That 
Darien
 is bounded only by the Sea on both sides, without so much as a 
Spanish
 For
 or Garison, from 
Nombre de Dios
 to the Gulf of 
Darien
 on the North Sea, or from the River of 
Che∣
o
 to the River 
Congo
 on the South Sea. The Ter∣ritories of the 
Spaniards
 confining on both ends of the 
Isthmus
 are not unlimited, but are restricted on


both sides by the 
Dariens,
 who has been already said, were never subject to 
Spain.
 Nor is it any new thing in the World for independent Soveraignties to lie inclos'd within the Dominions of other Princes; to instance in no more than 
Orange
 and 
Avignon
 in 
Europe, Ceuta, Metilla,
 &c. possessed by the 
Spani∣ards
 themselves in 
Africk,
 which lie in the very Bo∣som of 
Morocco,
 and yet the 
Spaniards
 don't think their Title to them e're a whit the worse. The 
Dutch
 and 
Portugueze
 have both of them Settlements on the Coast of 
Brasil,
 to which the 
Spaniards
 pre∣tend a Right. The 
French
 have Settlements in 
Hi∣spaniola
 and 
Guiana,
 notwithstanding the Neighbour∣hood of the 
Spaniards.
 The 
English
 and 
French
 have both of 'em Plantations in 
Newfound-land.
 The 
Dutch
 in time of Peace settled on 
Long Island
 in the middle of the 
English
 Plantations, yet no War en∣sued upon it. The 
English
 possessed themselves of 
Bahama
 Islands, tho' the 
Spanish
 Fleet passed betwixt them and 
Florida:
 And the 
English
 have several times settled at 
Port-Royal
 in 
Campechy Bay,
 to cut Logwood, &c. and remov'd and settled as they found convenient. King 
Charles
 II. in time of Peace grant∣ted a Patent to Dr. 
Cox
 to settle a Colony in the Bay of 
Mexico,
 which was never question'd by the 
Spa∣niards:
 And the 
French
 have now since the Conclu∣sion of the last Peace, planted a Colony on the Ri∣ver 
Messissipi
 in that same Bay, against which we hear of no Complaints from 
Madrid.
 So that the Plea of the 
Spaniards
 from this Topick is perfectly over∣
urn'd by Common Practice, the Law of Nations, and their own Concessions in parallel Cases.






ANSWER.


If the Matter be well weighed, it will be no dif∣ficult Task to find out, that these Cases mentioned by our 
Calidonian,
 are so far from being parallel to the 
Scots
 Settlement at 
Darien,
 that they are of a quite different Nature. Dr 
Cox
's Patent came to


nothing, and what occasion was there for the 
Spani∣ards
 to complain then? And because the 
English
 have now and then Landed in 
Campechy Bay,
 to cut Log-Wood, Is this, I say, to be put in comparison with the 
Scots
 attempt upon 
Darien?
 Some 
Dutch
 settled themselves among the 
English
 in 
Long Island,
 but in a peaceable manner▪ and tho' no War ensued, yet Complaint was made of it, and the Matter brought to an Agreement.


The 
Dutch
 and 
Portuguese
 have both Settlements in 
Brasil,
 the 
French
 in 
Hispaniola
 and 
Guiana,
 and the 
English
 and 
French
 in 
Newfoundland;
 What Argu∣ment is this to the 
Scots
 Settlement in question? For whoever questioned but that different Nations might settle their Colonies upon waste Grounds in the same place, provided they were not in any Bodies Posses∣sion before. The Instances he gives of 
Orange, A∣vignon, Ceuta,
 and 
Metilla,
 which lie (as he says) in the Bosom of other Prince's Dominions, seem to car∣ry something of more Weight with it, in so far as they prove that there is a possibility of independent So∣vereignties being inclosed by the Dominions of other Princes▪ I could furnish our Author with a great many more of this nature, as the Imperial Cities in 
Germa∣ny,
 the Lordship of 
Vianen
 in 
Holland,
 the 
Mor∣lacks
 in 
Dalmatia,
 and the 
Cossacks
 on the Frontiers of 
Poland
 and 
Muscovy;
 but all duly considered, it will appear, that they are still of a different Nature from the Matter in Question. For 
Orange
 and 
Avig∣non
 are the Remnants of those many Lordships and Principalities▪ which formerly composed the Empire of 
France,
 before it was brought in subjection under one Head: Their Situation is such, that they can∣not be relieved from abroad, and their strength so in∣considerable, as not to be able to hold out against the first Attack of the Prince who commands round a∣bout it: The Case is quite different with the 
Spani∣ards
 in 
America,
 who when they established them∣selves there by their Sword, had not the least reason 
o leave those petty Principalities unattempted, which lay in the very Heart of their Conquests, and


by reason of their convenient Situation on the Sea∣shoar, might one time or other prove dangerous Neighbours, if not brought to Submission either by force of Arms, or a voluntary Surrender. If the Em∣perour of 
Morocco
's strength were equivalent to his Title, he might very justly drive the 
Spaniards
 from the 
African
 Coast, where they have no other Title but Possession; and those Places which I have men∣tioned are so engaged either by Alliances or other Contracts to those Princes, in whose Dominions they are inclosed, that without offering a notorious vio∣lence to those Engagements, they cannot submit themselves to any Foreign Power.






DEFENCE.


The next Plea (says our Author) of the 
Spaniards,
 is from the Treaties betwixt them and the Crown of 
Great Britain,
 of which they alledge the Settlement of the 
Scots
 at 
Darien
 to be a Breach: But that there's no ground for this Allegation, will appear to those that peruse the said Treaties, 
viz.
 that of 
May
 23▪ 1667. and that of 
July
 1670. wherein there's not the least mention of excluding either Party from en∣larging their Dominions in 
America,
 upon Wastes, or by consent of the Natives, in such places as have ne∣ver yet been possest by 
Spain,
 or 
Great Britain.
 So that all that can be infer'd from those Treaties, is, that they were a mutual Security for the peaceable possession of what each Crown enjoy'd in that Country, and no more; which is sufficiently confirm'd by the Patent granted to Dr. 
Cox,
 and the settling and removing of the 
English
 in 
Cam∣pechy
 Bay, &c. without Controul, as before men∣tion'd.








ANSWER.


If it were granted by the 
Spaniards,
 or sufficient∣ly proved by the 
Scots,
 that their Settlement at 
Da∣rien
 was made in such a place as never had any de∣pendency on 
Spain,
 it might easily be granted, that their Establishment there was no breach of those Treaties; but I hope they will allow at the same time that till the same be proved beyond Contradiction, we ought at least to suspend our Judgment in this point, which hitherto has not appear'd so evident in the 
English,
 as ours to our 
Calidonian:
 For thus he says further.






DEFENCE.


Having thus made it evident that the 
Spaniards
 have no manner of Title or Right to 
Darien,
 it is natural in the next place to shew that they themselves are guilty of the Breach of Treaty by proceeding in this Affair as they have done.


By the third Article of the Treaty between the Crowns of 
Great Britain
 and 
Spain,
 concluded at 
Madrid, May
 12/23. 1667. it is provided, 
That if any Injury shall be done by either of the said Kings, or by the People or Subjects of either of them, to the People or Subjects of the other, a∣gainst the Articles of that Alliance, or against common Right, there shall not therefore be given Letters of Reprisal, Marque, or Countermarque, by any of the Confederates, until such time as Ju∣stice is follow'd in the ordinary Course of Law.
 Yet the 
Spaniards
 without any such Procedure, or offering in the least to prove their Title to 
Darien,
 present a virulent and huffing Memorial, at the ve∣ry first charging the King 
with want of Friendship, and a breach of Alliance, and threatning to take such measures as the
 shall think meet:
 When their sickly


Monarchy has not yet had time to breath, since res∣cu'd from the common Danger wherein 
Europe
 was involv'd, by the Arms of that very Prince, whom they treat so ungratefully.


But this is not all: for contrary to the express Words of that same Treaty, they attack the 
Scots
 by Sea and Land, who had done them no Injury, but acquainted them that they came thither peaceably, without any hostile design against them, or any o∣ther People, and were so generous as to reject the Motion of Captain 
Andreas,
 one of the 
Darien
 Prin∣ces, and their Ally, when he offer'd to make them Masters of 
Panama,
 if they would but joyn him with 500 of their Men.


The 
Spaniards
 have also, contrary to the 10th and 11th Articles of the Treaty concluded at 
M drid, July
 8/18 1670. concerning 
America,
 de∣tain'd the 
Scots
 and 
English
 Prisoners who were for∣ced a shoar at 
Carthagena
 by Shipwrack, tho all such Practices be expresly provided against by the said Articles: And they have also violated the 14th Ar∣ticle of that Treaty which forbids Reprisals, except in case of denying or unreasonably delaying Justice. From all which it is evident that the King of 
Great Britain
 has just reason to demand Satisfaction of the 
Spaniards
 for Attacking his Subjects contrary to Treaty; and that the 
Scots
 being thus injuriously treated, may very lawfully, not only make Repri∣sals upon the 
Spaniards
 for themselves, but joyn with the King of 
Darien
 in taking 
Sancta Maria, Panama,
 or any other place belonging to the 
Spaniards
 in that Country, of which the 
Dariens
 are Natural Lords, and the 
Spaniards
 Tyrannical Usurpers, as is plead∣ed by the King of 
Darien
 himself; and therefore he invited the 
English
 Buccaneers to assist him to retake it: And by this Capt. 
Sawkins
 justified his Proceed∣ings in a Letter to the Governour of 
Panama,
 assert∣ing that the King of 
Darien
 was true Lord of 
Pana∣ma,
 and all the Country thereabouts; and that they came to assist him. 
History of Buccaneers,
 Vol. 2. Part 4. P. 32. And we have mentioned before that Capt.



Sharp,
 who was accused of Piracy, for that same Expedition, and succeeded 
Sawkins
 in his Com∣mand, was acquitted in 
England,
 because he had that Prince's Commission.






ANSWER.


If it had been made so evident as our Author ima∣gines, that the 
Sp
iards
 h
ve no Title upon 
Dari∣en,
 I would soo
 
 with him in Opinion, that they themselves had 
 guilty of that Breach of these Treaties, whic
 
 charge upon the 
Scots;
 but this being look'd upon by the now unbyass'd, as a Case, which at the bes
 is yet undetermin'd, the Question is, Whether as su
h they have controve∣ned against several of the Articles of these two Treaties. I will not pretend here to Patronize or defend every step the 
Spania
ds
 have made since the 
Scots
 Settlement, this ought to be left to the Deter∣mination of His Majesty of 
Great Britain,
 who, as he is the true Judge of it, so no Question, but he will in due time demand Reparation for the Miscarriages committed against the said Treaties: I will only put the Reader in mind of that most ancient and gene∣ral Maxim founded upon the Law of Nations, 
Vim vi repelere licet.
 What Wonder is it, if the 
Spaniards
 when they saw a Foreign Nation, without their per∣mission, Land good store of Men, and other War∣like Instruments, in a place which they look'd upon as their own Propriety, and which is of the utmost consequence to them? What Wonder is it, I say, when they saw them erect Fortifications, and enter into Alliance with those who were at that time their declared Enemies (according to our Author's own Confession) they endeavoured to draw that Thorn out of their Feet, without seeking first for Redress at so many Thousand Miles distance. I would have our Author turn the Tables, and let the 
Scots
 make the Case their own, whether they would not force any Foreign Nation from their Shoar, that should


pretend to come in the same manner to settle them∣selves without leave in any place under their Pre∣tension or Jurisdiction. If it be considered, What a considerable Traffick the 
English
 have in 
Spain,
 it is evident, That it had been in their Power to make themselves an ample amends by way of Re∣prisals; but since they have not taken any such Mea∣sures, their endeavours to dislodge the 
Scots
 from 
Darien,
 at such a distance from 
England,
 may admit of a much more favourable Construction, than our zealous 
Calidonian
 would put upon it. He goes on further.






DEFENCE.


Having fully prov'd that the 
Spaniards
 have no Title to 
Darien,
 it remains to be prov'd that the 
Scots
 have as good and just a Title to their Settle∣ment there, as any People in the World can have; which may easily be demonstrated thus: They were authorized by an Act of Parliament, and the King's Letters Patent, 
to plant Colonies in
 Asia, Africa, 
or
 America, 
upon Places not inhabited, or any other Place, by consent of the Natives, not possest by any
 European 
Prince or State.
 Being provided with this Authori∣ty, than which there cannot be a greater▪ or one more duly and honestly limitted, they Equipp'd their Ships, and landed on the North side of the 
Isthmus
 of 
Darien
 in 
November
 1698. where the 
Spaniards,
 as has been fully prov'd, never had any Posseis
on, and no other 
European
 Prince or State pretends any Claim to it. Being arriv'd there, they fairly obtain'd the Consent of the Princes and People of the Country, and particularly of Captain 
Andreas,
 who is the chief Man in that Tract; and after a solemn Treaty and Alliance deliberately made, and wrote in 
Spanish,
 because the said Prince understands that Language, they peaceably enter upon their new Colony, without either Force or Fraud. So that they have religiously kept to the


Conditions of the Act and Patent, which is a plain Demonstration that they have a just and legal Ti∣tle to their Settlement, and a Right to the Prote∣ction of the Government, against the Attempts of the 
Spaniards,
 or any other People whatsoever.






ANSWER.


The 
Scots
 Title to their Settlement at 
Darien,
 pursuant to their Patent, might pass for very good, if they could make it evidently appear, that the same had not 
been possess'd before by any European Prince or State,
 according to the Tenure of the said Letters Patent; but till that be done upon a more sure Foundation than our 
Calidonian
 has pleas'd to lay, they ought not to be angry, if the Govern∣ment is not so forward in granting them the d
si∣red Protection; And I suppose, the 
Scots▪
 for all our Authors Threats, will be better advised 
 they join with the Natives in making an 
 upon 
Panama,
 or any other strong 
 
Spaniards,
 for fear they should by 
 their Commissions, forfeit all the righ
 
 In∣vested with by Virtue of the said Grant
 
 other irreparable Mischiefs upon their 
. But let us now hear, what our Author says to the next Point, which has a more particular Relation to 
England.






DEFENCE.


The next Topick to be insisted upon, is, The Advantage or Disadvantage that may redound to 
England
 from this Settlement. We shall begin with the Disadvantage which consists in the supposed Damage it may do to the Trade of 
England;
 and that it may, as is pretended, occasion a Rupture betwixt them and 
Spain.
 To this we may easily Reply, That being a distinct and Independant Na∣tion, we are not oblig'd to consult their Interest,


any further than they consult ours; and that we have as much reason to maintain this Colony, be∣cause of the Advantage it may bring to our selves, as they have to oppose it, because of the Disad∣vantages that they fancy may arise from thence to 
England.
 But withal we deny that it can be any damage to their Trade, which from that part of the World consists chiefly in Sugar and Tobacco, nei∣ther of which are yet to be found in 
New Calidonia.
 But that which we look upon to be a compleat An∣swer to the Objection, is this, That they may be Sharers with us in the Settlement if they please, and by consequence Partners in the Profits and Trade, and lay it under such Regulations as may prevent its endamaging the Commerce of 
England.


And whereas it is further Objected, That by the great Immunities and freedom from Customs grant∣ed to the 
Scots
 Company for so many years, we shall be able to Under Sell the 
English
 Company, forestall their Markets, and lessen His Majesty's Customs: We Answer, That this Objection is in a great measure obviated, since we do not now pre∣tend to set up an 
East-India
 Trade; but admitting it were true, it will be to the general Advantage of the 
English
 Nation, since the Buyers are always more than the Sellers. It must certainly 
e better for the Kingdom in general, that every one who has occasion for Muslin or 
Indian
 Silks, &c. should save so many Shillings 
per
 Yard or Piece in their Pockets, than that some two or three Merchants should once in an Age get Money enough to make a Daughter or two a Countess or Dutchess. Nor can it be denied, but it's better for 
England,
 that House-keepers in general should save that Money to buy Provisions for their Families, which con∣sumes our own Product, than that a dozen of Mer∣chants should be enabled by the extravagant Prices of those Commodities to keep their Coaches. Add to this, That the 
English
 if they please by joining with the 
Scots
 may have an equal share of all those Immunities; and if there should be for some time a


lessening of the King's Customs, of which there is at present no manner of prospect, it will be suffi∣ciently made up in time to come by a large Addi∣tion, if that Colony prospers; so that the King's Bounty in that respect is but like the bestowing of charge to improve barren or waste Ground, which will return with treble Interest to him or his Heirs.


There's another Objection made against the 
Scots
 Company, That by their Constitution such Ships as belong them must break Bulk no where but in 
Scot∣land,
 which will diminish the number of 
English
 Ships and Seamen, and make 
Scotland
 the only Free Port of all those Commodities. To which it's Re∣plied, That tho' our own Ships are obliged to break Bulk no where but at home, they don't lay the same Obligation upon others, but, allowing them a free Trade to 
Darien,
 they may carry their Goods where they please; or upon fair Proposals, there's no doubt but the Parliament of 
Scotland
 will give the 
English
 all possible Liberty as to that matter.






ANSWER.


Allowing the 
Scotch
 Nation to be Independant, (tho' this has been questioned by some) our Author, tells us, They are not obliged to consult the Interest of 
England
 further than they consult theirs; which indeed is the best Argument he has made use of hi∣therto in the Defence of the new Settlement: But then I hope, he will also grant, That this being Re∣ciprocal betwixt these two Nations, he ought not to blame the 
English,
 if they won't Sacrifice their own Interest to that of the 
Scots,
 and take all ne∣cessary and legal Precautions against their Encroach∣ments, to the Disadvantage of our Trade. This Objection, he says, may be answered, By making such Regulations as will prevent the endamaging the Commerce of 
England.
 This is much sooner said than put in practice; For if the 
Scots
 could have found out an Expedient, which might be satisfacto∣ry


both in respect to the Honour and Interest of the 
English
 Nation in that Point, Why was it not pro∣posed and put in Execution before the 
English
 saw themselves under a necessity to represent their Grie∣vances against the 
Scots
 new Company to His Ma∣jesty, and to take such further Measures against it as they judged most suitable to their own Interest? He further would perswade us. That the Immuni∣ties from paying Customs, granted to the 
Scots
 Com∣pany, cannot be any Detriment to 
England;
 because Muslin, Indian Silks, &c. will be sold Cheaper for the general benefit of the Buyers; But what would in such a case become of our 
East-India
 Trade, who being obliged to pay heavy Customs, could not afford to Sell at the same Rate? What would become of our Silk Manufactory, and the 
Turkey
 Company? It is certain, That a great many thou∣sands of People, who maintain their Families by the Silk Manufactory, must be reduced to a star∣ving Condition, if those 
East-India
 Silks were sold at a cheaper Rate than they are now. This is indeed the way to make our Merchants go on Foot, and s
t the 
Scots
 on Horseback. By the Consti∣tution of this New 
Scots
 Company, their Ships are obliged to break Bulk no where but in 
Scotland:
 This Advantage he pretends to balance, by assu∣ring us, That the 
Scots
 Parliament will Dispence with the 
English
 upon that Score; But pray, what Reason is there for the 
English
 to depend on the favour of a 
Scots
 Parliament, when they may carry on the 
East-India
 Trade in their own Coun∣try without it? especially, since it remains doubt∣ful, under what Restrictions and Limitations this Liberty might be granted to the 
English.
 But let us hear what he says, in Reference to the danger of a Rupture with 
Spain.








DEFENCE.


Then as to the hazard of a Rupture with 
Spain,
 we Reply, That the 
Spaniards
 are in no Condition to break with 
England,
 when they are not able to maintain themselves against the Insults of the 
French
 by Sea and Land; and the only way to secure them in the 
British
 Interest, is to have a powerful Colo∣ny in 
Darien,
 which lying in the very Centre of their 
American
 Dominions, and within reach of their Silver and Gold Mines, will be an effectual Curb upon them, and not only prevent their own Hostilities, but their joining at any time with our Enemies; or if they do, being Masters of their Money, we shall speedily cut the Sinews of their War.






ANSWER.


That 
Spain
 is no Match for 
England
 at this time, in case of a Rupture, is scarce to be denied by any who have the least insight into the Affairs of 
Eu∣rope;
 but this does not answer the Question in hand; which is, Whether it be for the Interest of 
England
 to run the hazard of a Rupture with 
Spain,
 on the Account of the 
Scots
 Settlement? which I answer in the Negative. For, tho' the Monarchy of 
Spain
 be brought to so low an Ebb, as not to be formidable to us, yet at this juncture, when the 
French
 as well as the 
Austrian
 Family, endeavour to court this Crown at any rate; I see not the least reason, why the 
English
 should run the hazard of such a Rup∣ture, which at the best, would Ruin their Traffick in 
Spain,
 endanger that in the 
Mediterranean,
 or at least put us to the charge of keeping a great Fleet at Sea for the security of our Commerce; and all this for what purpose? to maintain the 
Scots
 Settle∣ment, which we look upon as against our own In∣terest;


But if it was not, Who would Reimburse the Charges? I question whether the 
Scots
 Com∣pany, or perhaps the whole Kingdom, would be a∣ble to do it. But if, notwithstanding all this, the 
Spaniards
 should transgress their Bounds, we have a King who knows how to maintain his Authority, and the Glory of the 
British
 Nation, of which he has given us an Instance in the 
Spanish
 Ambassador, but a few Days ago. But let us hear, how our Au∣ther proceeds further.






DEFENCE.


In the next place we urge, That it will be very much for the Interest and Advantage of 
Eng∣land,
 to incourage and support us in this Settle∣ment.


1. Because by this means the 
Scots
 will increase their Shipping, and come in time to have a Naval Force, capable of assisting the 
English
 in the com∣mon Defence of the Island, in maintaining the So∣veraignty of the Seas, and Convoying their Mer∣chantmen in time of War. The 
English
 can't al∣ways promise to themselves the Amity of the 
Dutch,
 who are their Rivals in Trade, and differ far enough from them both in Temper and Interest, there's no∣thing to cement them but the Life of our present Soveraign: Whereas the Scots being united with the 
English,
 under the same Government, and Inha∣biting the same Island, must of necessity have the same Interest as to Trade, and to defend the Coun∣try against all Foreign Invaders, as they constantly did in former times, against 
Romans, Danes, Saxons,
 and 
Normans,
 notwithstanding their living then under a separate Prince, and their frequent Wars with 
England.
 Nor is that brave Resistance which a few of them made to the 
Dutch
 at 
Chatha
,
 to be


forgotten, which did in a great measure repair the Honour of 
England.






ANSWER.


Our 
Caledonian
 puts the probability of increasing the Naval Strength of 
Scotland
 in the Front, which he supposes to be absolutely necessary for the 
English
 Interest at Sea. But I am afraid it will be a great while before the 
Scots
 will be able to make any con∣siderable addition to it. It is the more safe way for us, to encourage our own Commerce, and Naval Force, which is such, that if rightly managed, we need not be beholding to the 
Scots,
 for what assi∣stance they are able in all likelihood to give us at Sea. But, says he, The 
Dutch
 may not be always our Friends, because they differ from us in Temper and Interest: and so do the 
Scots
 as the case now stands, in reference to the last; and as to the first, I know not whether it be not as different from the 
English,
 as that of the 
Dutch:
 Besides, if we may take this Gentleman's Word for it, the 
Scots
 may not be always our Friends neither, but look for Alli∣ances abroad, to support their Interest against ours, which is a seasonable Caution he has been pleased to give us, as we shall see anon.






DEFENCE.


2. As 
Scotland
 increases in Shipping, they will increase in Wealth, and by consequence be able to bear a greater share of the Burden of any Foreign War, which will save Men and Money to 
England,
 and lighten their Taxes.



3. The Success of the 
Scots
 in their 
American
 Co∣lony, will be an additional Strength to the 
English
 Plantations in the 
West-Indies,
 as well as an ad∣vancement of their Trade, by consuming their Pro∣duct, and giving them theirs in exchange.


4. The Success of the 
Scots
 at 
Darien,
 will be of great advantage to 
England▪
 for the more Money the 
Scots
 acquire by their Trade, the more they will spend in 
England,
 which being the Seat of the Go∣vernment, must frequently be visited by their Nobi∣lity and Gentry, who generally furnish themselves in 
England
 with their best Apparel, Houshold Fur∣niture, Coaches and Horses, &c. besides the Money that the Young Noblemen and Gentlemen spend in their Passage through that Nation, when they go and come from their Travels. These things occasion their laying out vast Sums of Money annually in the Ci∣ty of 
London,
 which being the Seat of the Govern∣ment, will as certainly draw Money from 
Scotland,
 as the Sun draws Vapours after it.






ANSWER.


We will take it for granted, that the 
Scots
 would consume more Money in 
England
 than they do now, if they were more wealthy, but I deny that thereby we should draw Money from 
Scotland:
 For if they could under-sell our 
East-India
 Commodities, that would be such an over-balance to what they can in all likelihood spend in 
England,
 that it bears not the least proportion to it; whereas now the 
Scots
 are o∣bliged to 
England
 for all these things▪ they having no considerable Manufactures among themselves, or any better conveniency to supply the want of them but from 
England,
 which, considering how little we stand in want of the Products of their Country, and how little it affords, must needs draw Money from 
Scotland.
 The Products of our 
West-India
 Planta∣tions consisting chiefly in Sugar and Tobacco▪ I don't see what great prospect of advantage the Consump∣tion


of them in one Colony, can bring to the 
En∣glish,
 when they furnish the greatest part of 
Europe
 with them to a much greater advantage; and as to the 
Scots
 be
ing a share in the Burthen of a Foreign War, the Supposition of it is built upon so an un∣certain a Foundation, that it scarce deserves to be mentioned considering especially, that the 
Scots
 hitherto have not been the most forward in parting with their Money upon that account.






DEFENCE.


5. The Success of the 
Scots
 in their Foreign Plan∣tation, will not only ease 
England
 of great numbers of their Pedlars, so frequently complain'd of in Par∣liament by Country Corporations and Shopkeepers, but it will occasion the return Home, and prevent the going out of vast numbe s of their Youth, who follow the same sort of Imployment, or betake them∣selves to the Sword in 
Denmark, Sweden, Poland, M
s
oy, Germany, Holland
 and 
France;
 by which means the Government of 
G
at Britain
 may furnish their Fleets and Armies 
t a much cheaper and easier rate than formerly▪ and with as good Mariners and Soldiers as 
ny in the World.


6. The 
English
 by joyning with the 
Scots
 and supporting their 
olony at 
Darien,
 may have their P
a
e brought home in their own Bottoms and from their own Mines, with which we are assured that Country abounds, without being obliged to touch at 
Cadiz
 or any Foreign Port, being liable to the vexa∣tious Indulto's of Foreign Princes, or in such ha∣zard of being intercepted, as they many times were during the late War.


7. The 
English
 may by joyning with the 
Scots
 ren∣der themselves more capable than ever of keeping the Balance of 
Europe
 in their hands; a Trust which Nature and Providence seems to have assign'd 'em, since their Situation and Naval Force not only makes it proper for them, but they have had an opportuni∣ty


put into their Hands in little above the Revoluti∣on of one Century, of twice breaking the Chains of 
Europe
 when threatned with Slavery; first by the 
Spaniards,
 and then by the 
French.
 This is so much the more evident, that by being possess'd of 
Darien,
 they will be able either to prevent the uniting the 
Spanish
 and 
French
 Monarchies; or if not so, to render that Union so much the less dangerous, when it will be in their power to seize their Trea∣sure and Dominions in the 
Indies,
 without which, that bulky Monarchy must fall by its own weight This is likewise of so much the greater importance, that it may very probably either prevent a Religious War, towards which the 
Papists
 discover so much inclination, or at least bring it to a speedier Conclu∣sion: For we have as good reason to look upon the 
Spanish
 Mines in the 
West-Indies,
 to be Antichrist's Pouch, by which he maintains his War against the Church, as the Old 
Taborites
 had to call the Silver Mines in 
Bohemia
 by that Name. It is certainly the surest Method of destroying Antichrist, to seize his Purse; for if he once be depriv'd of 
Judas
's Bag, he will quickly drop St. 
Peter
's Keys. It's by the Charms of her Gold that the 
Babylonish
 Whore hath made the whole World to wonder after her, and the Kings of the Earth to be drunk with the Cup of her Fornication.






ANSWER.


By this Cant of Antichrist's Pouch, the 
Babylonish
 Whore, and some other Expressions our 
Calidonian
 makes use of in this Treatise, one would shrewdly suspect him to be a Disciple of the Old 
Covenanting Crew,
 the more because I find he has a great Itch af∣ter the 
Spanish
 Mines, a Property belonging in a most peculiar manner, to that Gang, who sold their King for Money, as 
Judas
 did 
Christ.
 But to return to our more serious Considerations.



I think we have all the reason in the World to hope, that, since 
England,
 has been twice instru∣mental in breaking the Chains of 
Europe,
 and keep∣ing up that Balance which is absolutely necessary for the Repose of 
Europe,
 without the Assistance of the 
Scots,
 it may be able to maintain its ancient Glo∣ry without their New Settlement at 
Darien;
 which, in my Opinion, will contribute but very little either to prevent the Union of the 
Spanish
 and 
French
 Mo∣narchies, or to render it less dangerous; for, I am well Convinced, that if the last should happen, the 
French
 would soon tell the 
Scots, Veteres migrate Colo∣ni:
 For if they would not take the Compliment, they would find some other way to send them back to the 
Highlands.


He promises the 
English
 Golden Mountains, and that without any trouble, free from all Imposts and Danger; but if these Mines should prove Abortive, if it should happen with them as the Poet says, 
Parturiunt Montes,
 would not the 
English
 deserve to be Laugh'd at, to expose their 
Spanish
 Commerce to hazard, for the uncertain hopes of some imaginary Mines promised them by an unknown Gentleman, who can give no better Account of them, than what has been told him by others, who perhaps have it no more than by hearsay themselves. We are obli∣ged to this Gentleman however, for the Kindness he is pleased to shew for 
England,
 in easing us of the 
Scotch
 Pedlars, but the Danger is, that, in case the 
Scots
 should be permitted to furnish 
England
 with Muslins, Silks, &c. as he mentioned before, they would all turn Wholesale Men, and those that now are gone to carry their Packs upon their Backs would go about the Country with as many Pack-Horses, as a Carrier that comes to 
London
 freighted with all sorts of Commodities.








DEFENCE.


8. By this means the 
English
 may be better able to prevent the Ruine of their Trade in the 
Mediterra∣nean
 and 
West-Indies,
 if the 
French
 should possess themselves of the Kingdom of 
Spain:
 And they will likewise be the better able to prevent their pos∣sessing themselves of the 
Netherlands;
 which if once they should do, and get Ports there capable of hold∣ing a Fleet, they would also ruine their 
Eastland
 Trade, and put a period to the Liberties of 
Great Britain.


9. It will effectually Unite the 
Scots
 to 
England
 by an inseparable Tie, if the 
English
 join us in this Undertaking: Their Ancestors would have gladly purchased this Union at a much dearer rate, but were always outbid by 
France:
 And the want of that U∣nion made the 
English
 not only an easie Prey to their successive Conquerors, but lost them all the large Provinces that they enjoy'd beyond Sea, which were their Natural Barriers, gave them a free Access to the Continent, and made the 
English
 Name so glo∣rious in the Days▪ of their Ancestors.






ANSWER.


I can't for my Life conceive how this 
Scots
 Settle∣ment should prove of such vast consequence, as to support our 
Mediterranean
 and 
West-India
 Trade a∣gainst the 
French,
 if they should become Masters of 
Spain,
 much less how it should influence our Affairs so near Home, as to prevent them from possessing themselves of the 
Netherlands,
 unless the whole be built upon the hopes of his Mines; but as the same hitherto are but imaginary, so he would have done very well to have given us some more satisfactory reason for this Assertion.



What he says of the 
English
 being made an easie Prey to their Conquerors, for want of an Union with 
Scotland,
 ought to be look'd upon as a piece of Romance; and this Gentleman, has forgot what he alledged not long before, 
viz.
 how instrumental the 
Scots
 had been in defending the Island against any Foreign Invaders: All that the 
Scots
 have to brag of in this Case is, that the great distance and unkindness of their Climate secured them against the Attempts of those who being possess'd of the Fertile Grounds of 
England,
 did not think it worth their while to look after them among the Cold and Barren Moun∣tains. It must be confess'd that their frequent In∣roads in 
England,
 gave the 
French
 a fair opportunity of ridding their Hands by degrees from the 
English,
 but it was not so much for want of such an Union, as he would make us believe, but because they were glad of any opportunity to supply their Wants at Home, by Plundering and Ravaging the Borders of 
England;
 and because, as he himself confesses, the 
French
 paid them very well besides for their Pains; so that we may well apply to 
Scotland,
 what 
Jagurtha,
 if I mistake not, said of 
Rome: O Romam venalem, dummodo emptorem invenisset:
 For the 
Scots
 were al∣ways for him that did bid most. But let us hear his last Argument upon this Head.






DEFENCE.


10. It will be of general Advantage to the 
Protestant
 Interest, and contribute to the Advancement of pure Christianity, without any of the 
Romish
 Sophi∣stications: Which certainly ought to weigh much with all true 
Protestants;
 and so much the more, that the Pope and the Conclave of 
Rome
 have espoused the Quarrel of the 
Spaniards
 in this Affair as a Cause of Religion. Doubtless the poor 
Americans
 will be more in
linable to imbrace Christianity, when they find the difference of the Morals and Doctrine be∣twixt 
Protestants
 and 
Papists,
 and see that the former


treat them with Humanity, and seek their Welfare both in Body and Soul; whereas the 
Spaniards
 have render'd themselves, and the Religion they profess, odious, by the Inhumane Cruelties and Brutish Lusts which they have exercis'd upon so many Millions of the Natives. This is so far from being a Calumny, that an unexceptionable Author of their own, 
Don Bartholomew de las Casas
 Bishop of 
Chiapa,
 formerly mention'd, who was an Eye-witness of their Cruel∣ties, gives an Account that they had in his Time de∣stroyed above 40 Millions of the poor 
Indians;
 tho' they receiv'd them with the greatest kindness imagi∣nable, were ready to do 'em all the Friendly Offices that one Man could desire of another, and testified their great Inclination to have embrac'd the Christi∣an Religion. But the 
Spaniards
 aim'd at the Destru∣ction, and not at the Conversian of the 
Indians;
 and are avowedly charg'd with it by the said Bishop, who in many places of his Book declares, That af∣ter they had sent for the Chiefs of the Countries to meet them in an amicable manner, which the poor harmless Creatures did without suspicion of any Fraud, these merciless Tyrants Murder'd them by wholesale, on purpose to make themselves terrible to them. This was a Practice so inconsistent with Hu∣manity, that all the People 
f the World ought to have resented it: as having much more reason to de∣clare the 
Spaniards
 to be Enemies to Mankind, than ever the 
Roman
 Senate had to declare 
Nero
 to be such.


But this sort of Treatment compar'd with what they made others to suffer, may well be call'd Mer∣cy: For tho' it was Death, the 
Indians
 were hereby quickly deliver'd from their Misery; whereas they put Multitudes of others to lingring Deaths, that they might feel themselves die gradually; and yet this is not so intolerable neither as the Condition of those poor People that had the Misfortune to survive that Cruelty; for the whole time of their Lives under that miserable Servitude, is but Death prolong'd or making his Attacks upon 'em by intolerable Labour,


and continual Hunger, the most insupportable of all Plagues; those poor Creatures that toil in the Mines, and are imploy'd in Pearl-fishing, &c. having no more Sustenance allow'd them, and that too of the coarsest sort, than is just enough to keep Soul and Body together, in order to prolong their Misery. Then let any Man, who has but the least remains of Humanity left him, judge whether the 
Scots
 could be Criminal, if they should have actually Landed upon a 
Spanish
 Settlement, and have seiz'd the same, in order to deliver their Brethren the Sons of 
Adam,
 from such Hellish Servitude and Oppression as the above mention'd Bishop describes; and if no Man that has any Bowels of Compassion within him can say they could, what shadow of reason is there to blame the 
Scots
 for erecting a Colony where the 
Spa∣niards
 never had any footing?






ANSWER.


If this could be proved beyond Contradiction, I must confess no Body could blame the 
Scots
 for set∣tling themselves at 
Darien,
 but till that be done, we must ask our Author'
 Pardon, to suspend at least our Judgment, as to the legality of their Title to it. If I mistake not the matter, he does not seem to build altogether upon that Foundation so much as upon their having forfeited their Title by their unheard of Cruelties; for, to what purpose else this tedious Repetition, when he had enlarged himself suffici∣ently before upon that Theme? Which indeed may serve to render the 
Spaniards
 odious but in my Opi∣nion is but a slender Addition towards the strength∣ning of their Title upon 
Darien,
 since with the same Right, not only the 
Scots,
 but any Nation whatsoe∣ver might lay claim to all 
America,
 as far as it is in the Possession of the 
Spaniards.
 We will therefore hear what he has to alledge for us 
Caledonians
 in the third Head.








DEFENCE.


The next thing to be consider'd is, Whether the 
Scots
 without the assistance of 
England,
 may proba∣bly maintain their footing there, which there's no doubt may very well be determin'd in the affirma∣tive.


1. Because the whole Kingdom of 
Scotland
 being more zealous for it, and unanimous in it▪ than they have been in any other thing for forty or fifty Years past, it is not to be doubted, but they will use their utmost Efforts to support themselves in it by their own strength; or if that will not do, by making Al∣liances with other Nations that are able to assist them with a Naval Force.


2. If they meet with no other Opposition but what the 
Spaniards
 are able to make to them, it will be easie for the Nobility, and Gentry, and Royal Burroughs of 
Scotland,
 to raise Money upon their Lands, &c. to increase their Stock for the 
American
 Trade, and buy Ships of Force to protect it. Nay, without that it's but giving Commission to the Buc∣caneers to become an over-match for the 
Spani∣ards.


3. Supposing the 
French
 should offer to join with the 
Spaniards,
 and assist them to drive the 
Scots
 from 
Darien,
 as some say they have already proffered; we are not to imagine that the 
Spaniards
 will accept their Proffers in this case, when they refused them as to the driving the 
Moors
 from before 
Ceuta.
 The Rea∣sons are obvious: They declin'd the accepting their Proffers as to 
Ceuta,
 because they would not thereby give the 
French
 an opportunity of possessing them∣selves of any of their Towns in 
Africa,
 as it is but too common for Foreign Auxiliaries to do in such cases. Then certainly they have much greater rea∣son to refuse their Proffers as to 
Darien, America
 be∣ing of infinitely more value to them than some 
A∣frican
 Towns: And if once the 
French
 should get


footing there, it would be in vain for the 
Spanish
 Grandees any further to dispute the Succession of 
France
 to their Crown; for they would immediately seize upon their Mines and Treasures in the 
West-Indies,
 without which the 
Spanish
 Monarchy is not able to support it self.


Or supposing the King of 
Spain
 should live for many Years, and by consequence keep the 
French
 out of possession; yet having once goot footing at 
Darien,
 which they will certainly do, if the 
Scots
 be expell'd by their assistance, the 
Spaniards
 will quick∣ly be convinc'd to their Cost, that they are more dangerous Neighbours than the 
Scots;
 not only be∣cause of their greater Power to do them more mis∣chief, but because of their incroaching Temper, which all 
Europe
 is sensible of; and being of the same Religion with the 
Spaniards,
 and having of late Years set up for the Champions of Popery, they will by the Influence of the Clergy, bring all the 
Spanish
 Settlements of 
America
 to a dependence upon them, and a love for them as the great Protectors of the Catholick Faith; which will at once destroy the Interest of 
Spain
 in 
America.


This will appear to be no vain Speculation, to those that consider the Temper of the Popish Cler∣gy, and the Insolence of the 
Spanish
 Inquisitors, who so daringly reflected upon the late Alliance of 
Spain
 with Protestant Princes and States, tho' absolutely necessary to preserve that Nation from being swal∣lowed up by 
France.


Whereas the 
Scots
 being Zealous 
Protestants,
 and for that very reason hateful to the Popish Clergy and Laity, they are under a moral Impossibility of ha∣ving so much Influence to withdraw the 
American
 Settlements from the Obedience of 
Spain:
 And be∣sides, being under an obligation by the Principles of their Religion, and their fundamental Constitution, not to invade the Property of another, the 
Spa∣niards
 have no cause to fear any thing from them, provided they forbear Hostilities on their part; but on the contrary may find them true and faithful Al∣lies,


and useful to assist them in the defence of their Country, if attack'd by the 
French
 as in the late War: It being the Interest of the 
Scots,
 as well as of the 
Spaniards,
 to prevent the Accession of the Crown of 
Spain
 to that of 
France.


These things, together with the known Endea∣vours of the 
French
 to procure an Interest amongst the Natives of that Country, and especially with 
Don Pedro
 and 
Corbet,
 in order to a Settlement, make it evident enough, that it is the Interest of 
Spain
 the 
Scots
 should rather have it than the 
French,
 who have already been tampering with the 
Spaniards
 as well as with the 
Indians,
 and doubt not to have a large share of 
America
 whenever the King of 
Spain
 dies.






ANSWER.


Most People, I am apt to believe, will soon agree with our Author in this point, That the 
French
 would be by far the more dangerous Neighbours to the 
Spa∣niards
 in 
America,
 both in respect of their Power, and the influence they might have over the 
Spaniards
 in 
America
 upon the score of their Religion; but I hope he will also grant me, that it is much more for the 
Spanish
 Interest, not to be troubled with any Neigh∣bours at all there, that may be in any probability to interfere with them either in Power or Traffick; but whether the 
Spaniards
 will be able, as the case now stands, to gain this point, is what must be the present Object of our consideration.


I will for once suppose the 
Scots
 to be so unanimous in this matter, as our Author would have them, yet it is much to be doubted whether they would be so fond of a Project that is subject to so many Casualties, and to no small danger of succeeding, as the Nobi∣lity, Gentry, and others, to mortgage their Estates upon that Score; but supposing they should, it would still be a question, Whether they could be in a condition to procure time enough, such a number of serviceable Ships, and other Necessaries requisite


for the maintaining themselves at 
Darien
 even against the 
Spaniards
 alone. For, granting they should not be in a capacity to force the 
Scots
 from their Fortifi∣cations, they have other means to annoy and inter∣cept their Convoys, which, considering a Com∣munication betwixt the 
English West-India
 Plantati∣ons, and the 
Scots
 Settlement, is taken off, may in all likelihood reduce them to a starving condition there, or at the best put the 
Scots East-India
 Compa∣ny under a necessity of providing their Ships with such strong Convoys, at so great a distance, that the Charge may surmount the Profit, notwithstanding the hopes of their rich Mines.


What our 
Calidonian
 says of giving Commissions to the Buccaneers, is little to the purpose, it being evident that they have no power so to do by vertue of their Letters Patents, and that consequently by so doing, they must put themselves in the same range with them, which would be the ready way for them to forfeit all the Title they can pretend to upon that Settlement.


But supposing the 
Scots
 should put the 
Spaniards
 so hard to it, as to be obliged to seek for aid by the 
French,
 who at this juncture seem to be very for∣ward to purchase their good will at any rate, it is very probable that they may have their Assistance upon much easier terms, than the Surrender of 
Da∣rien
 into their Hands; neither is it to be questioned, but that the 
Spaniards,
 who are jealous of the 
French
 to the highest degree, might take such sure Measures as to the Number and other Circumstances of the 
French
 Auxiliaries, as might free them from the dan∣ger of being surprized by them, especially at this time, when the 
French
 are so cautious of creating a Jealousie in that Nation.


What our Author alledges of 
Ceuta,
 is no paral∣lel to this; the only reason of the 
Spaniards
 refusing the Offers of the 
French
 as to the relief of that place, being no more, than that they thought it inconsi∣stent with their Grandeur, to leave the Glory of re∣lieving a place, which is so near them, to a Foreign


Nation▪ when as yet they were sufficiently able to defend it against the 
Moors.


It may also be consider'd, That the 
French
 have not shewn so much inclination to get a firm footing in 
America,
 as our Author would fain perswade us; for what reason I will not pretend to determine; but certain it is, that when Monsieur 
de Ponti
 had made himself Master of 
Carthagena,
 they might with as much probability have defended themselves there a∣gainst the 
Spaniards,
 as the 
Scots
 in their Settlement at 
Darien.
 And if 
Darien
 was of so much conse∣quence to 
France,
 what could hinder them from set∣tling there, when Monsieur 
de Ponti
 touch'd at that place in his way to 
Carthagena.
 Which makes it very evident that the 
French
 did not think it for their Interest to plant any Colonies at this time in 
America,
 or at least not at or near 
Darien.






DEFENCE.


But admitting (says our 
Caledonian)
 that the 
Spa∣niards
 should so far mistake their Interest, as to ac∣cept of the Proffers of the 
French
 to expel the 
Scots,
 it is not impossible for the latter to find other Allies than the 
English
 to assist them with a Naval Force to maintain their Possession.


The 
Dutch
 are known to be a People that seldom or never mistake their Interest: They are sensible how useful the Alliance of 
Scotland
 may be to them, both in regard of their Liberty to Fish in our Seas without controul, and of being a Curb upon 
Eng∣land,
 in case the old 
Roman
 Maxim of 
delenda est Carthago,
 should come any more to be applied by the 
English
 to that Republick, as in the Reign of King 
Charles
 II. They are likewise sensible of the Advantage it would be to their Trade to be Partners with the 
Scots
 at 
Darien;
 and how effectual it may be to disable the 
French
 to pursue their Claim to 
Spain,
 and by consequence to revive the old Title of that Crown upon their own seven, as well as to


swallow up the other Ten Provinces. These things, together with a long continued Amity and Trade be∣twixt 
Scotland
 and 
Holland,
 and their Union in Reli∣gion and Ecclesiastical Discipline, are sufficient to evince that the 
Dutch
 would become our Partners in 
America
 with little Courtship. That they are able to assist us in that case with a Naval Force sufficient, is beyond contradiction; and that they would soon be convinc'd it is their Interest to do it, to prevent that monstrous Increase of the French Monarchy, is obvious enough from the Part they Acted in the late War.


But admitting that none of those Considerations should prevail with the 
Dutch,
 and that they should likewise abandon us; it is not impossible for us to obtain an Alliance and Naval Force from the Nor∣thern Crowns: It's well enough known that those Kingdoms abound with Men and Shipping, and that they would be glad with all their hearts to make an Exchange of these for the Gold and Silver of 
America▪
 which they might easily carry from Town to Town, and from Market to Market, without the trouble of a Wheel-barrow, as they are now obliged to do with their Copper. From all which it is evident enough that it is not impossible for the 
Scots
 to maintain themselves in 
Darien
 with∣out the Assistance of 
England.






ANSWER.


Tho' it may not be altogether impossible, yet it appears to me very improbable, that the 
Scots
 shou'd be able to maintain their Settlement without the As∣sistance of the 
English,
 who, by reason of their ma∣ny and considerable Plantations in the 
West-Indies,
 are the only People from whom the 
Scots
 might have seasonable assistance, especially with Provisions; what our 
Caledonian
 says concerning the Alliances with the 
Dutch
 or the 
Northern
 Crowns, are meer Chime∣ra's: For, first I would ask him, how the 
Scots
 can


enter into any such Alliance in opposition to 
Eng∣land?
 But supposing they could, the 
Dutch,
 who as he tells us himself, seldom mistake their Interest, have the same Reasons that 
England
 has, to oppose the 
Scots East-India
 Company, because of their vast Commerce in those Parts; and the 
Spanish
 Trade is of such consequence to them, that they will scarce be perswaded by our Author, to break with 
Spain,
 and consequently to lose the Advantage of their Traffick in that Kingdom, for the uncertain hopes of his 
Darien
 Mines. What he says of the Useful∣ness of the 
Scots
 Alliance to 
Holland,
 in case of a Rup∣ture with 
England,
 is said to no purpose at this time of the day, and is besides this Founded upon another supposition, 
viz,
 That the 
Scots
 must be in a Condi∣tion to assist them, which they are not likely to do as long as they are united with 
England
 under one Head. But our 
Caledonian
 tells us strange Won∣ders about the Northern Crowns; he takes a great deal of pains to give us to understand, that Gold and Silver would be much more convenient for the 
Swedes
 and 
Danes,
 than Copper; truly, I will not quarrel with him upon this Point, but I am apt to believe, that they will scarce part with their Men and Shipping before they are better convinced what share they are to have of them, and whether the 
Scots
 are able to make good their Promises; for without that, they had better keep to their Copper, which yields them good Money in Foreign Countries. Be∣sides that their great distance makes their assistance very difficult and uncertain, if not quite useless, it being the Opinion of most People who have a true insight into this matter, that the want of seasonable Supplies, which must be sent at so great a distance, will oblige the 
Scots
 to quit their Settlement of 
Da∣rien,
 unless they will rather chuse their Graves a∣mongst their imaginary Mines, where we will leave them to their own Destiny, and apply to them the Epitaph the Poet made upon the Hare-brain'd 
Phaeton.




Hic situs est 
Phaeton,
 currus auriga paterni


Quem si non tenuit, magnis tamen excidit ausis.


But we must hear what he further says upon the fourth and last Head.






DEFENCE.


The next thing to be discours'd of, is, what the Consequences may probably be, if the 
English
 should oppose us in this Settlement.


We could heartily wish there had never been any ground for this Suggestion, and that the Opposition we have met with from 
England
 hath been less Nati∣onal than that which we had from both their Houses of Parliament, after the passing an Act for an 
Afri∣can
 Company, &c. in ours: And it were to be wish∣ed that so many of the 
English
 had not given us such proofs of an alienated Mind, and Aversion to our Welfare, as they have done since by their Resi∣dent at 
Hambourgh,
 and their late Proclamations in their 
West-India
 Plantations: And we could have wish'd above all that His Majesty of 
England
 had not in the least concurr'd, or giv'n his Countenance to that Opposition; And we could wish that his 
English
 Counsellors, who put him upon those things, would remember that 
Strafford
 and 
Laud
 lost their Heads for giving King 
Charles
 I. that fatal Advice of oppressing and opposing the 
Scots.






ANSWER.


It is not denied but that those two Lords were, by the 
Presbyterian
 Party, Sacrificed to their Covenant∣ing Brethren in 
Scotland,
 but what is that to the


Point in question, since what has been done in op∣position to the 
Scots
 Settlement, is, by his own Con∣fession, a National Concern, back'd by the Autho∣rity of both Houses of Parliament in 
England;
 and it cannot be look'd upon any otherwise, than as a most unaccountable Arrogance in our 
Caledonian,
 who stiles himself a Private Man in his Dedication, to call in question, and that in so gross a manner, what has been done in this Matter by His Majesty and His Parliament, for the promoting and main∣taining their own Commerce: But let us see how he proceeds further upon this Head.






DEFENCE.


We did verily think (says he) that the suffering of our Crown to be United with that of 
England
 in the Person of King 
James
 their I. and our VI; our seasonable coming to the Rescue of their expiring Liberties in the Reign of King 
Charles
 I. our being so instrumental to rescue them from Anarchy and Confusion, by the Restoration of King 
Charles
 II. and above all, or generous and frank Concurrence with them in the late happy Revolution, and Ad∣vancement of King 
William
 III. We did veri∣ly think, that all these things deserv'd a better Treatment: And to evince that they did, we shall beg leave to insist a little upon the first and last.


The 
English
 have no cause to think that we were ignorant of the Reason why their Politick 
Henry
 VII. chose rather to Match his Eld
st Daugh∣ter with the King of 
Scots,
 than with the King of 
France,
 because he foresaw, that if the King of 
Scots
 should by that means come to the Crown of 
England,
 he would remove the Seat of his Government thi∣ther, which would add to the Grandure and Riches of 
England:
 Whereas if the King of 
France
 did by


that means fall Heir to the 
English
 Crown, he would certainly draw the Court of 
England
 to 
Paris.
 This the 
Scots
 were so far from being ignorant of, that ma∣ny of the Nobility and Gentry did express their dis∣like of the Union of the Crowns, as well knowing that it would reduce our Kingdom into a Subjection and Dependance upon 
England,
 and drain us of what Substance we had; and therefore some of them ex∣press'd themselves on that occasion, That 
Scotland
 was never Conquer'd till then: Yet such was our Zeal for the Common Welfare of the Island, the Interest of the 
Protestant Religion,
 and of 
Europe
 in general, which were then almost in as much danger by 
Spain,
 as they have been since by 
France,
 that we quietly and freely parted with our King, and suffer'd him to accept the 
English
 Crown, rather than that Nation should be involv'd in War and Confusion, and the 
Protestant Religion
 endanger'd by another Successor, as it must necessarily have been, had the 
Infanta
 of 
Spain,
 whose Title was then promoted by the 
Popish
 Interest, succeeded. And all the Re∣ward we had for this Condescension and Kindness, was a Contemptuous and Disdainful Refusal, on the part of 
England,
 of an Union of the Nations when proposed, tho' the same would visibly have tended to the Benefit of the whole Island, the general Ad∣vantage of 
Europe,
 and the Security and Increase of the 
Protestant
 Interest. And our King was so little thankful on his part, that tho' he promis'd solemnly in the Great Church of 
Edinburgh
 before his Depar∣ture▪ that he would visit his Ancient Kingdom once in three Years, he never saw it after but once, and that not till Fourteen Years after. And by the in∣fluence of that same Faction in 
England,
 who are still our Enemies, he made Innovations both in Church and State. These were the first Advantages we had by the Union of the Crowns.


His Son King 
Charles
 I. had scarce ascended the Throne, when we had new Proofs of the Disadvan∣tages we labour'd under by that Union; for he by the Advice of some Enemies to our Nation, did in


an Imperious and Arbitrary manner send for our Crown, tho' the only Monument almost left us of our Independency and Freedom; but was generous∣ly answer'd by him that had it in keeping, That if he would come and be Crown'd in 
Scotland,
 he should have all the Honour done him that ever was to his Ancestors; but if he did not think it worth his while, they might perhaps be inclin'd to make choice of another Soveraign, or to that effect; as recorded in the Continuation of Sir 
Richard Baker
's History.


Another Disadvantage we had by that Union of the Crown, was this, That that Unfortunate Prince being inspir'd with an Aversion to the Constitution of our Country, by his Education made War upon us to bring us to a Conformity with 
England
 in Church-Matters.


We shall not here offer to debate which of the Churches was best Constituted, or most agreeable to the Scripture-Pattern: It suffices for our Argument, That we were Injur'd in having a Foreign Model of∣fer'd to be obtruded upon us, which was the Conse∣quence of the Union of the Crowns, and of having our King Educated in another Nation; but that was not all, another mischievous Effect of the Union was this, That whatever King 
Charles
 had deserv'd at our Hands, yet out of Natural Affection, Consci∣ence and Honour, we were oblig'd to do what we could to prevent his Illegal Trial and Death, and to defend his Son's Title, which threw us into Convul∣sions at Home, occasion'd us the loss of several Ar∣mies, and expos'd our Nation afterwards to Ruine and Devastation, by our implacable Enemy the U∣surper, which together with the Ungrateful Retri∣butions made us by the Government after the Resto∣ration, were enough to have wearied any Nation un∣der Heav'n, but our selves, of the Union of the Crowns▪








ANSWER.


Our 
Caledonian,
 as I believe, being somewhat mi∣strustful of the strength of the 
Scot
 Title, as well as of his Arguments, to perswade the 
English,
 that it is for their Interest to maintain the 
Scots
 in their New Settlement, thinks it best to take other Measures now, and to try whether he can hector them into a Compliance with the 
Scots;
 he sets the best Counte∣nance upon the Matter, and labours very hard to give the World to understand, that the 
English
 are highly indebted to the 
Scots,
 for suffering, as he terms it, their Crown to be United with that of 
Eng∣land.


I will not enter into a Dispute with him, about the design of 
Henry
 VII. in Marrying his Daughter to the King of 
Scots.
 I will allow him to have acted in this Point as much for the Interest of 
England,
 as our Author would have him; but what is all this to their suffering the two Crowns to be United under one Head. I hope he will grant me, that both the 
English
 and 
Scots
 Crowns were Hereditary; and be∣ing such, how was it in the Power of the 
Scots
 to alter the Succession upon that Score? I will fur∣ther allow him, that whenever two Kingdoms, or States are United under one Head, the less Potent will in some measure be independent on the other: But I would also have him grant me this Position, That if at that Juncture the Infanta of 
Spain
 had succeeded in 
England,
 the 
Protestant
 Interest both in 
England
 and 
Scotland,
 must have been brought into no small Jeopardy, and our Author would have had no great occasion at this time to brag of the So∣veraignty and Independency of the 
Scots.
 He makes a large Rehearsal of the Miscarriages in the Reign of King 
James
 I. and King 
Charles
 I. especially of their Innovations in Church Matters in 
Scotland;
 but our Author might have remembred if they in∣troduced Episcopacy among them, they were not


behind hand in furnishing 
England
 with Presbytery. What he alledges concerning their Sufferings in the Civil Wars, for the Defence of K. 
Charles
 I. and his Sons Title, ought not to be put upon the 
English
 Score. I wonder how he can be so forgetful as not to remember, That the 
Scots
 Covenanters were of that Gang that begun the Dance, and all the reason in the World they should help to pay the Fidler; And this is so unquestionably true, that many of the wiser sort are of Opinion, That the Presbyterian Faction would never have carried Matters to that heighth, under that unfortunate Prince's Reign, if they had not been back'd by the Covenanting Party in 
Scotland;
 So that 
England
 may in a great measure lay the Calamities of the late Civil Wars, and its fatal Consequences, to their Doors, which our Au∣thor would fain put altogether upon the 
English.
 But let us see how he goes on in magnifying his beloved 
Scots.






DEFENCE.


Yet such was our Zeal for the Protestant Interest, the Welfare of the Island, and the Liberty of 
Eu∣rope,
 that tho' we had a fair opportunity of provi∣ding otherwise for our security and the Advance∣ment of our Trade, and of forming our selves into a Commonwealth, or of bringing 
England
 to our own Terms, yet we frankly and generously con∣curr'd with them to settle our Government on the same Persons, and in the same manner as they did theirs, and all the Reward we had from them, is, that an Union of the Nations, tho' twice propos'd by His Majesty in Parliament, hath been rejected: To this they have added an opposition to our receiv∣ing Foreign Subscriptions at 
Hamburgh
 and else∣where, refus'd us a Supply of Corn for our Money,


to relieve us in our Distress; and discourag'd our Settlement at 
Darien,
 by forbidding their Subjects to Trade with us there. If these continued Slights be not enough to make us weary of the Union of the Crowns, let any Man judge.


To discover a little of the unreasonableness of this sort of Treatment, we dare Appeal to the calm thoughts of such of our Neighbours in 
England,
 as prefer the Interest of the Publick to private Animo∣sities, and foolish ill-grounded Piques, either as to Church or State; whether at the time of the Revo∣lution, and before we declar'd our selves, they would not have been willing to have assur'd themselves of our Friendship, at the rate of Uniting with us as one Nation? Had we but demurr'd upon forfeiting the late K. 
James,
 or made but a Proffer of renewing our ancient League with 
France,
 and joyning with that Crown to keep that Prince upon the Throne of 
Great Britain;
 they know we might have made what Terms we pleas'd with the late King and 
Louis
 XIV. on that condition, and might have been restor'd to all the Honours and Privileges that our Ancestors enjoy'd in 
France,
 which were almost equal to those of the Natives; and yet that gallant Nati∣on thought it no disparagement to them, however we be despis'd and undervalued now by a certain Party in 
England.


Had we but seem'd to have made such Overtures, the 
English
 must needs have foreseen that the natu∣ral Consequences of such a Design, if it had taken effect, must have been these, 
viz.
 The late King's Adherents in 
England
 would certainly have join'd us, and our Nation would have afforded them a safe Retreat, in case of any Disaster, till they could have concerted Matters to the best Advantage; The late King would not have yielded himself such an easie Conquest, not disbanded his Army in such a manner as he did; 
Ireland
 had certainly revolted, since eve∣ry one knows that the Revolution was begun, and in a great measure perfected there by the 
Scots
 of


the North; so that 
England
 must have become the Theatre of the War, and been liable to an Inva∣sion from 
France.


These must certainly have been the Consequences of our adhering to the late King, and the 
English
 would have thought they had had a very good Bar∣gain if they could have bought us off in that case with Uniting both the Kingdoms into one, and granting us a joint Trade to their own Plantations; whereas now they will not allow us to settle a fo∣reign Colony of our own, and treat us as Foreigners in theirs.






ANSWER.


Our Author has so entangled himself in pleading for the 
Scots,
 that he is almost beyond his Senses; for what Man, who is in his right Wits, could pro∣pose an Alliance with 
France,
 (which is in effect no less than to make 
Scotland
 a Province of 
France)
 as more advantageous to the 
Scots
 than their Concur∣rence with 
England
 in the last Revolution; for if they were become so indifferent as to their so much bragg'd of Liberty and Soveraignty, and their Re∣ligion to Boot, what need they have chang'd Ma∣sters? since King 
James
 would have eased them of both; and it appears to me, as if our 
Caledonian
 was rather for the last, since he takes so much pains to represent to us the consequences of it in the most passionate manner that could be: But if the matter be duly weigh'd, he has shot much beyond the mark; for supposing the 
Scots
 to have stood it out against 
England
 for King 
James,
 (tho' I must confess it im∣plies almost an absurdity to suppose it) the conse∣quences would not have been half so terrible as he would persuade us; for 
Scotland,
 being, by reason of its Situation, not easie to be relieved by 
France,
 as


long as the 
English
 and 
Dutch
 were Masters at Sea, they might perhaps have proved troublesome, but not so dangerous Neighbours, as to make 
England
 the Theatre of War; and it is, I think, odds on the 
English
 side, that they might have served them as 
Cromwel
 did; that is, to bring them under an entire Subjection, whereas they now enjoy many Privi∣ledges beyond other Foreigners, and have born but a very slender share in those vast Sums expended for the Glory and Interest of the Island in general.


It is not to be denied, but that their ready Con∣currence did hasten the Conquest of 
Ireland;
 but I am apt to believe, that their refusal would scarce have appear'd so dreadful to the 
English,
 as to make them receive Laws from the 
Scots.


I cannot pass by in silence here with what Arro∣gance he is pleased to reflect upon the Measures taken in 
England
 on the account of the 
Scots East-In∣dia
 Company, when it is beyond all question, That every independent Nation has an inherent Right to secure their Commerce against the encroachments of a Neighbouring Nation, which is the true state of the Case; which our Author terms Ingratitude, and I know not what, in the 
English,
 who did no more than to represent their Grievance to His Majesty's Consideration. He runs on further thus.






DEFENCE.


To shew that this is not a mere Conjecture, that has no other ground but a Vision of the Brain, they may be pleas'd to consider the honourable Privi∣leges granted us by their Ancestors, and some of the greatest Princes that ever sway'd their Scepter,
 viz. 
King
 Edward 
and
 William 
the Conqueror, who by the Consent of the States in Parliament assembled, Enacted,
 That the 
Scots
 should be accounted Denizons of 
England,
 and injoy the same Privileges with them∣selves, because of their frequent Intermarriages with the



English,
 and that they did ever stood stoutly as one Man with them for the common Ʋtility of the Crown and Kingdom, against the 
Danes
 and 
Norwegians,
 fought it most valiantly and unanimously against the common Ene∣my, and bore the burden of most fierce Wars in the King∣dom. This they will find in a Book, call'd, 
Archaiono∣mia,
 translated from the Saxon by 
William Lambard,
 and Printed at 
London
 by 
John Day,
 in 
1568.


It must be granted, that the Reasons of such a grate∣ful Retribution are redoubled now: Intermarriages betwixt the two Nations are more frequent than ever▪ the Union of the Kingdoms under one Crown for al∣most 100 years; the generous Concurrence of the 
Scots
 in the last Revolution; their loss of so many gal∣lant Officers and brave Soldiers in the common Cause during the late War, and the preservation of 
Ire∣land,
 which hath been twice owing to our Country∣men, might reasonably entitle us to the same Privi∣leges now, that our Ancestors were formerly allow'd by K. 
Edward
 and 
William
 the Conqueror. We need not insist on another sort of Obligation, that we have put upon 
England
 twice within this 60 years, 
viz.
 The delivering them from their Oppressions in the time of K. 
Charles
 I. the Anarchy of the Rump, and several Models of Armies and Junto's, by en∣couraging General 
Monk
's Undertaking; for it can∣not be denied that we had the Balance of 
Europe
 in our hands at the time of the last Revolution, and that we turn'd the Scale to the advantage of 
Eng∣land
 in particular, and of 
Europe
 in general, which must be allow'd to be as great a Service, as that which was so thankfully rewarded by 
Edward,
 and 
William
 the Conqueror; whence it is evident, that those 
Englishmen,
 who at present oppose our Settle∣ment in 
America,
 don't inherit the gratitude of their Ancestors, when they not only will not allow us to Trade in Conjunction with them, but withstand our doing any thing that may advance a Trade by our selves.



If they object, That what we did in all those Cases was no more than our Duty, and what we ow'd to our own Preservation as well as to theirs; it is easie to reply, That admitting it to be so, yet by the Laws of God and Men, People are incou∣rag'd to perform their Duties by Rewards; and their Ancestors were so sensible of this, that tho' they knew we were equally concern'd to defend the Island against foreign Invaders as well as they, yet they thought themselves oblig'd in Policy as well as Gratitude, to Reward us; which they not only did by that Honorary 
Praemium
 of allowing us to be De∣nizons of 
England,
 as above-mention'd, but some∣times gave to us, and at other times confirm'd to us the three Northern Counties of 
Northumberland, Westmorland,
 and 
Cumberland,
 to be held in Fee of the Crown of 
England.


It is likewise very well known with how much Honour the Parliament of 
England
 treated us, when they courted our Assistance against King 
Charles
 I. and what large Promises that Prince made us, if we would have but stood Neuter; which tho' we had reason to think many of those that opposed him had no great kindness neither for our Civil nor Ec∣clesiastical Constitution, yet the sense that we had of the common Danger that our Religion and Li∣berties were in at that time, made us proof against all those Tentations; so that after all Endeavours for a Reconciliation betwixt the King and the Par∣liament of 
England
 prov'd unsuccessful, we sent in an Army, which cast the Balance on the side of the latter; who before that time were reduc'd low enough by the King's Army, as is very well known to such as are acquainted with the History of those times, and is own'd by my Lord 
Hollis
 in his Me∣moirs lately publish'd.








ANSWER.


Our 
Caledonian
 most extreamly misses his aim, in relating those Matters as Obligations done to 
Eng∣land;
 for which they have but little reason to be thankful to them: Their behaviour under the Reign of K. 
Charles
 I. was such, that the 
English
 ought to keep it in eternal Remembrance; and in lieu of Acknowledgment, rather ought to take care of them, so that they may not be able for the future to be the Incendiaries of a Civil War, as they were at that time. For, after they had put all 
England
 into Confusion by their Encouraging, and after∣wards declaring for the Presbyterian Faction; after, I say, they had been instrumental in bringing this unfortunate Prince to his fatal End, they took the opportunity of siding with his Son; not out of any love to his Person, or to maintain his rightful Ti∣tle, as may appear by those Conditions they im∣posed upon him; but to Revenge themselves upon those, who had wrested the Power out of their Hands, and afterwards made them bear their share in those Miseries they had brought upon 
England.


Certainly our Author must think the 
English
 to be very ill versed in their own History, when he alledges, the 
Scots
 to have had any share in General 
Monk
's Undertaking, who can be so ignorant as not to know, that all what this General desired from, and was granted by the Convention of the 
Scots,
 was to furnish him with so much Money, as might maintain his Army in their march to 
London;
 and there is no question, but they understood their In∣terest so well, as that they would have parted with a far greater Sum to rid their hands of a conquer∣ing Army in their Bowels, and to set the 
English
 together by the Ears among themselves, by which means they might hope to recover their lost Li∣berty▪



For the rest, it is sufficiently evident, That if General 
Monk
 had at that time any Thoughts of recalling the King, (which I much question) he had more Prudence than to Communicate it to the 
Scots
 or any body else; For if the Rump had had the least suspicion of his design, they would scarce have made him General of all the Forces in the three Nations.


This is the true state of the Case, as to the first of these Obligations, our 
Calidonian
 brags of: What he says of 
Scotland
's turning the Balance in the time of the late Revolution, when it was in their hands, shews so much Vanity and want of Judgment in point of Policy, that it deserves no Answer; and I am apt to believe, the wiser sort among the 
Scots
 will owe him but little thanks for representing them as a People who could fall under a possibility of mistaking their own Interest and Preservation so far, as to let slip so extraordinary an opportunity, as was offered them by Providence, to secure their Reli∣gion and Liberty, and in lieu of that to Embrace a foreign Protection; or to speak truer, to submit their Necks under a Foreign Yoke, rather than to Unite themselves with the 
English
 under one Head; who perhaps, notwithstanding their foreign Alliances, might have taken this opportunity to bring them once for all to Reason, as 
Cromwel
 did, who's Title to 
Scotland,
 as their Conqueror, was own'd by all 
Europe.
 He goes on thus:






DEFENCE.


But to return to the last Revolution: Tho' we must own, that we owe our Deliverance to His Majesty, and were oblig'd in Conscience and Honour to concur with him; yet who could have blam'd us to have stood upon Terms before we had fallen in with 
England?
 especially, considering how ungratefully (nay villainously) we were treated by 
Cromwel
 and his Party, after we had sav'd them


and the Parliament of 
England
 from the Scorpions that the Cavaliers had prepar'd to Chastise them with; as is own'd by the said Lord 
Hollis.
 Nor could we have been any way culpable, if we had stood upon surer Terms, considering how unthank∣fully we were used, and Enslav'd by our late Kings, for whom we had acted and suffered so much. And tho' we must own, That no less Present than that of our Crown was sufficient to testifie our Gratitude for what the Prince of 
Orange
 had done for us, yet we were under no necessity of gratifying him in that manner, since our Deliverance was effected before-hand, and that he himself, in his Declaration, express'd it to be no part of his Design to come for the Crown; so that our Reward was as Frank and Generous.


Then as to 
England,
 we were under no manner of obligation to continue the Union with them: We might have insisted upon having our King obliged to reside as much amongst us as amongst them: That we should be govern'd without any consideration or respect to their Interest, any further than it fell in with our own. We might have insisted upon an Act that we should not be oblig'd to attend His Ma∣jesty at any time at the Court of 
England,
 about our Affairs; but that he should either attend upon our Administration in Person 
pro r
 nata,
 as he does now upon the Affairs of 
Holland,
 or lay down Methods to have his Pleasure signified to us at Home in such Ca∣ses as it was requir'd; which would save a vast deal of Money annually to the Kingdom of 
Scotland.
 Then as to the Succession, we were under no neces∣sity of settling it in the same manner as they did in 
England:
 For since they had made a Breach in the Line, they could not handsomly have blam'd us to have made an improvement of it▪ and either to have limited the Reversion after His present Maje∣sty's Death, as we should have thought best, for the security of our Civil and Religious Liberties; or we might have settled it upon the Prince of 
Orange,
 and his Issue b
 an
 other Wife, there being cause e∣nough


then to conceive that he was never like to have any by his late Excellent Princess: Had we taken any of these Methods, it must be own'd that 
England
 would have been considerably weakned by it; that we should have thereby had an opportunity of ma∣king such Foreign Alliances with 
France,
 as former∣ly, or with any other Nation as would have made 
England
 uneasie, and perhaps unsafe on occasion; and therefore it must be reckon'd highly Impolitick in our Neighbours, to treat us continually at such a rate, since we have so many open Doors to get out at.


They must not think that we have so far degene∣rated from the Courage and Honour of our Ance∣stors, as tamely to submit to become their Vassals, when for Two Thousand Years we have maintain'd our Freedom; and therefore it is not their Interest to oppress us too much. If they consult their Histo∣ries, they will find that we always broke their Yoke at long run, if at any time we were brought under it. The best way to assure themselves of us, is to treat us in a Friendly manner: Tho' we be not so Great and Powerful as they, it is not impossible for us to find such Allies as may enable us to defend our selves now, as well as formerly.


None of these things are suggested with an ill de∣sign to raise Animosity betwixt the Nations, or to perswade to a Separation of the Crowns, but merely to shew those of our Neighbours, who use us so un∣kindly, that they are bound in Gratitude, and Inte∣rest, to do otherwise, and particularly to support us in our 
American
 Settlement, and not to discourage us in that Undertaking, as they have hitherto done, and continue still to do in their 
American
 Colonies, by their Proclamations against having any Com∣merce, or Trade with the 
Scots
 at 
Darien;
 tho' they be settled there, according to the Terms of an Act of Parliament in 
Scotland.








ANSWER.


It is a most unaccountable piece of Insolence (not to say worse) in our 
Caledonian,
 to make use of such harsh Expressions, for no other reason, but because the 
English
 Parliament represented to His Maje∣sty in a most Humble Address, the Danger the Commerce of 
England
 was likely to be exposed to by the Encroachments of the New 
Scots
 Compa∣ny; and His Majesty's Answer to their Address, might have been a sufficient Warning to our 
Scots
 Polititian, that he was sensible of the Justice of their Request; and, that, as he had shewn himself a good King to the 
Scots,
 in granting them His Let∣ters Patents, He thought it reasonable not to deny His 
English
 Subjects any legal means to relieve themselves against that Danger. But our Author is so much overcome with the Conceits of his own Politicks, that he spares the 
Scots
 Convention, as lit∣tle as the 
English
 Parliament, whom he boldly accu∣ses for want of Conduct, at the Time of the late Revolution, because they did not make better Terms with the 
English,
 before their Concurrence with them. But those Wise Patriots who compos'd that great Assembly, were too sensible of the Danger that threatned them, if in lieu of Uniting their Strength with ours, they should miss this Op∣portunity of Rescuing themselves from the Weight of those Oppressions they had groan'd under for some Years before, and spend their Time in in∣sisting upon such Trifles as are mentioned here by ou
 
Caledonian,
 and don't deserve any An∣swer.


I will only insist upon one Point; I believe there is scarce any Body but what will grant me, that con∣sidering they had a considerable Party Headed by the Lord 
Dundee,
 who were their Enemies within their Bowels, it was impossible for them to stand Neuter; and considering how dangerous an Alliance


with 
France
 might have proved at that Juncture; nay, how useless it must have been to them, when the 
English
 and 
Dutch
 were Masters a
 Sea, what other way had they left for their own Preservation, than to settle the Government upon the same Bottom as they did, which being most conformable to the true an∣cient Constitution of an Hereditary Monarchy, did free them from the danger of falling into new Dis∣sentions at Home, in case of any sinister Accident. He goes on in his Plea.






DEFENCE.


We are not insensible that the present Juncture of Affairs obliges the Kingdom of 
England
 to carry fair with 
Spain,
 and may admit that in part as an Apo∣logy for some of that Opposition we have met with from them; but the questioning our Act of Parlia∣ment at first, and their hindring our Subscriptions at 
Hamburgh
 afterward, before ever they knew what our design was, make that Excuse of little weight: But allowing it all the force they would have it to bear, it may be worth their while to consider whe∣ther it be more their Interest to incourage the 
Spani∣ards
 in an unjust Opposition to our 
American
 Settle∣ment; or to support the 
Scots
 in maintaining their Right. It is certain that the 
Spaniards
 are in no con∣dition to break with 
England;
 or if they should, it's in the Power of the 
English
 to reduce them speedily to reason: Whereas if the 
Scots
 should miscarry in their Undertakings by the Discouragements from 
England
 before-mentioned, which exposes our Ships to be taken and treated as Pirates by any Nation that pleases, the infallible consequence of it will be, that the Ruine and Impoverishment of 
Scotland,
 which must necessarily follow such a Miscarriage, will immediately affect 
England
 both in her Trade and Strength: The City of 
London
 and the Northern Road, will soon feel the effects of it, when the Mo∣ney spent by our Gentry and Merchants continually


for Cloaths, Provisions, and Goods, ceases to cir∣culate there: 
England
 may become an easier Prey to a Foreign Enemy; since it will not be only the Loss of a Tribe, but of an entire Sister-Nation. Or supposing that 
Scotland
 should be able to bear up under the Weight of it, it will lay the Foundation of an irreconcileable Feud, and may perhaps issue in a War betwixt the two Nations; which did never yet terminate at long-run to the Advantage of 
Eng∣land,
 and is as unlikely to do so now as ever: For in such a Cas
 they would find us Unanimous as one Man against them: And therefore those who are E∣nemies to the Peace of the Nations, being aware of this, labour to effect their Design by another Me∣thod, and endeavour as much as they can to dash the Government and us against one another. But they are mistaken in the People of 
Scotland:
 We are sensible of our Obligations to King 
William,
 and know so well what is due to our Deliverer, that it surpasses all their Art to create in us the least ill Thought of him; it is not in the Temper of our Nation. The World knows that however frequent and successful we have been in reducing our bad Kings to Reason, yet there was never any People under the Sun more Loyal and Affectionate to good Princes than we have been; and if, when we have been forc'd to oppose our Monarchs, private Persons have sometimes carried their Resentments too high, yet the publick Justice of the Nation was always go∣vern'd with Temper.


We could multiply Instances to prove this, but need go no higher than the three last Kings, who tho all of them Enemies to our Constitution, as ap∣pear'd by their Principles and Practices, yet its ve∣ry well known what we both did and suffer'd for them, and particularly for King 
Charles
 I. tho' the Malice of a Faction in our Neighbouring Nation, fix'd a Scandalous Reproach upon us, as if we had Sold him; from which Reflection we are sufficient∣ly vindicated by the Lord 
Hollis
's Memoirs before∣mention'd; wherein that excellent Person makes it


evident, that tho' our War against that Prince was just, yet we had all possible Respect for his Per∣sons, made the best Conditions we could for his Safe∣ty and Honour, and to avoid greater Mischiefs, and the playing of our Enemies Game to the Ruine of our selves and His Majesty, we were necessitated to leave him in 
England. Memoirs
 p. 68.


Then since we carried it so to a Prince that had been no way kind to us, it will be impossible to cre∣ate a Breach betwixt us and a Prince, to whom, un∣der God, we owe all that we enjoy as Men and 
Christians:
 But at the same time our Neighbours, who think to drive that Nail as far as it will go, would do well to consider, that we never believ'd that Doctrine in 
Scotland,
 That it is unlawful to re∣sist a King, or any that have a Commission under him, upon any pretence whatsoever: We left that Doctrine in 
Scythia,
 from whence some Authors derive our Origin, and think it only fit to be sent back to 
Turkey,
 from whence it came.


We know very well how to distinguish betwixt a Lawful Power, and the Abuse of it; and our An∣cestors rightly understood how to Obey the Lawful Commands of their Princes, when Masters of themselves, and how to Govern by their Authority, and in their Name, when they were not; tho' they did not think themselves obliged to obey their Per∣sonal Commands, when the Fortune of War, or other Accidents had put them into the Hands of our Enemies.


Thus we refused Obedience to K. 
James
 I. when detain'd Prisoner in 
England,
 contrary to the Law of Nations, and carried over into 
France,
 to Com∣mand his Subjects there not to bear Arms against the 
English
 Army, where he was in Person. We told him we knew how to distinguish betwixt the Com∣mands of a King, and those of a Captive.








ANSWER.


Here is a Flourish indeed upon the Behaviour of the 
Scots
 towards their good and bad Kings, to com∣ment upon which, would require a whole Volume, we will only take notice here of what he says concern∣ing their selling King 
Charles
 I. to the 
English,
 of which he clears his Countrymen, but very indiffe∣rently, the whole amounting to no more, than that they made the best Terms for him and themselves too, which does not take away the Stain of surrender∣ing their Prince to his Enemies when they had a good Army to back their Pretensions. The rest is ta∣ken up with his Arguments to convince the World; that the 
Englesh
 ought at this Juncture, to prefer the interest of 
Scotland
 before that of 
Spain,
 upon which Head we have said so much already, that I think it needless to make a fulsome Repetition of it here. I will only add thus much; That it may be hoped that those who have the Management of the 
Scots East-India
 Company, will have more Prudence than to venture their All upon that Bottom; and, that consequently 
Scotland,
 if they miscarry in this Un∣dertaking, will not be in so much danger of being utterly ruin'd, as this Gentleman imagines. His threat∣ning Speculations about a War betwixt the two Na∣tions, and the Unanimity of the 
Scots
 against us, s
a
ce deserves to be taken notice of since I see no rea∣son why he should suppose the 
English
 so unconcern∣ed at their own Interest, as to act with less Vigour a∣gainst them, than they would against us, which I am apt to believe would not turn to the Advantage of 
Scotland,
 all this time, when the 
English
 are more Potent than ever, and the 
Scots
 have not the same Prospect of being back'd by a Foreign Power, as they were in former Times, when by reason of our Civil Dissensions they proved sometimes trouble∣some, but never were dangerous Neighbours. But let us see, what he has further to say upon this Head








DEFENCE.


To return to the Point of what may probably be the Consequences if the 
English
 should proceed to any further degree of opposition; or if the 
Scots
 should miscarry in the Design. It's reasonable to be∣lieve that the 
English
 will be so wise as to forbear Hostilities, tho' we are very well satisfied there is a Party in that Nation who bear ours no good will; it's to be hop'd they will never be able so far to lea∣ven the sound part of the 
English
 Nation, as to oc∣casion a Rupture betwixt them and us: Yet we must needs say that we look upon their way of treating us to be a very unaccountable thing, and that it was no small Surprize to us, to find that the 
English
 should look on our taking Subscriptions in 
England,
 in order to admit them Joint-Sharers with our selves, in the Benefit of the Act to encourage our Trade, to be no less than a high Misdemeanour. We have rea∣son likewise to complain of their constant practice of pressing our Seamen in time of War, as if they were their own Subjects, and that they should treat us in other respects as if we were Aliens: And some∣times confiscate Ships, by reckoning 
Scots
 Mariners as such: So that the 
English
 have not only depriv'd us of the warm Influences of our Court, the want of which is a considerable addition to the natural coldness of our Climate, but they likewise oppress us on all occasions, and do manifestly endeavour to prevent our Application to Trade. We know there's a Party in that Nation, who think we sustained no great loss by the removal of our Princes; but we would wish them to consider what a murmuring they themselves make when the King goes annually to the 
Netherlands
 (tho' the Safety of 
Europe
 requires it) because of the Damp it puts upon Trade, and the Money it carries out of the Kingdom.


Let them consider then what our Nation has suf∣fer'd in that respect now for almost an Hundred


years, besides the lessening our esteem in the Eyes o
 the World, and yet they will neither admit us to the Privileges of Fellow-Subjects with themselves, nor suffer us to take such measures as may inable us stand on our own bottom.


We know that it was a Maxim in some of the late Reigns, That it would never be well till all that part of 
Scotland
 on this side 
Forth,
 were reduc'd to a Hunting-field; but we were in hopes the bit∣terness of those days had been past: yet it seems that Party have still so far the ascendant amongst our Neighbours, as to procure a publick opposition to all our Endeavours for raising our Nation by Trade.


It will upon due Examination be found as bad Policy as it is Christianity, to urge, as some of our Neighbours do, that it is the Interest of 
England
 to keep the 
Scots
 low, because they are an independent and free Nation, and were our ancient Enemies; and therefore may be dangerous Neighbours if they grow rich and potent. Nothing but Rancour and inveterate Malice can suggest such sour thoughts as these. It were fit that sort of Men should be purg'd of their Choler. The 
Scots
 to obviate all dangers from that Head, have, tho' they be much the an∣cienter Nation, condescended so far as several times to propose an Union, which the Gentlemen of that Kidney have hitherto prevented; and therefore we would wish them to look back into their Histories, and upon casting up their Accounts, make a true Estimate of whatever they gain'd by a War with 
Scotland.
 They will find that their Ancestors, as well as the 
Romans,
 have been sensible, as 
Tacitus
 expresses it, 
Qu
s sibi Viros Caledonia sep
suerit;
 and that as it was true what our Historian says of the War made upon us by 
Edward
 I. that 
Scotorum No∣men pene delevit;
 it was also true, what he says on the other hand, that 
Angliam vehementer con
ussit:
 So that those Gentlemen take the direct way by oppo∣sing us to run into those Dangers they would avoid; for they may assure themselves that if the 
English



Opposition to our 
American
 Settlement should once break out into Hostilities, the 
Scots
 will find some Allies, ancient or new, that will be glad of the op∣portunity to join with them. Or if, which is most probable, tho' highly impolitick, the 
English
 should so far neglect the 
Scots,
 as to suffer them to be over∣power'd by the 
French,
 they may be sure that the 
Scots,
 when put to their last shift, can always make an honourable Capitulation with 
France:
 It's not to be doubted, but that Crown would be very willing to renew their ancient Alliance with us; and be∣sides allowing us a share at least in the Trade of 
Da∣rien,
 would on condition of giving them the Pos∣session of 
New Caledonia,
 restore us likewise to all our ancient Privileges in 
France.
 They would think it a very good purchase if they could secure themselves of that Colony by doing so, granting us what secu∣rity we could resonably desire for the uninter∣rupted Injoyment of the Protestant Religion, and a Freedom of Trade to all places of the World where it did not actually interfere with their own Settle∣ments and Colonies. So that if this should be the case, we leave it to our Neighbours to judge what would become of their 
East
 and 
West-India
 Trade and Plantations, and whether they would not find it difficult to stand out against 
France
 and us, now that they have no footing on the Continent, since formerly, when they had so many Provinces of that Kingdom in their possession, they found it a hard matter to do it, and at last lost every foot of their 
French
 Dominions: whereas had they been in Union with us, they might certainly have retained them, and by consequence have prevented the great Calamities that 
Europe
 hath since groan'd un∣der by the prodigious Increase of the 
French
 Mo∣narchy.


This we think sufficient to convince those angry Gentlemen in our Neighboring Nation, that are so ve∣ry much disgusted with our 
American
 Settlement, that it is the Interest of 
England
 to join with us and sup∣port it, and that it may be of dangerous consequence


to them either to oppose or neglect us: Whereas by joyning cordially in this matter, they may unite us inseparably to themselves for ever, inrich their own Nation, secure and advance the Protestant In∣terest, keep the Balance of 
Europe
 in their hands, and prevent the returns of its danger, their own ex∣pence of Blood and Treasure to save its being threatened with Slavery any more, either by the House of 
Bourbon
 or 
Austria.
 Therefore we cannot believe after all, but our wise and politick Neigh∣bours will at last see it their Interest to protect and incourage us in this matter, that we may mutually strengthen and support one another against the 
French,
 who are loudest in their Clamours against our Settlement, because if incouraged and improved it will defeat all their ambitious and Antichristian Designs; and thereby we shall also be in a condi∣tion to assist the 
English
 Plantations in the 
West-In∣dies,
 who as we find by the proceedings of the Earl of 
Bellamont
 and the Assemblies of 
New England
 and 
New York,
 are sufficiently sensible of their danger, from the incroaching temper of the 
French,
 which increases every day; and it is evident, that their new design'd Colony in 
Mississipi
 River, looks with a dangerous Aspect upon all the 
English
 Plantati∣ons in 
America,
 and may be more justly esteemed an Incroachment upon 
Spain,
 as being in the Bay of 
Mexico,
 than our Plantation in 
Darien:
 which argues the Humour of that Nation, to make such an Out-cry against the 
Scots
 who have invaded no Man's Property, when they themselves are so notoriously guilty of it; and therefore it would seem to be the Interest of 
England
 rather to streng∣then themselves by our Friendship, and to look after the 
French,
 than to provoke us to look out for other Allies by their opposition and neglect.








ANSWER.


I am apt to believe, our 
Caledonian
 begins to have but a very indifferent Opinion of the success of their New Settlement, and so, like a desperate Gamester, who is reduced to the 
 Stake, throws at all; and is for Sacrificing the 
rien Settlement, nay their own Religion and 
 as well as that of 
Europe,
 rather than to 
 
hare in it; For what he says of security to be g
n by the 
French
 for the Enjoyment of the Prot
nt Religion, are nothing but Chimerical Notions, as indeed are all the rest. For, supposing the 
French
 should be so fond of the Possession of 
Darien▪
 (which they don't seem to be, as has been dem
strated before) it is only a vain Speculation, th
 
eby they would become so Potent, as to become an over-match for 
England
 and its Allies, who are so nearly con∣cern'd in its Preservation; and it is more than probable, that the 
Scots
 in such a case would pay the Fidler; since, considering the Situation of 
Scot∣land,
 its want of good Harbours▪ and Barrenness in many Places, it would be very difficult for the 
French
 to send them any considerable Supplies of Men, or Provisions, when the 
English
 and 
Dutch
 are Masters of the Channel; which was the rea∣son that the 
French
 never so much as attempted the Relieving of my Lord 
Dundee,
 who gave them the fairest opportunity in the World of getting a footing in 
Scotland,
 if they had either thought it practicable, or worth their while. But we must go on to see how he winds up the thread of his Arguments.








DEFENCE.


We shall conclude this matter with one or two more Arguments to prove, That it is the Interest of 
England
 to joyn with us in this Affair; by which also it will appear that there is nothing advanc'd in these Sheets out of any ill Design against the 
Eng∣lish
 Nation, or to persuade to a disuniting of the Crowns; but on the contrary, that a stricter Union is absolutely necessary, that both Nations may have but one Interest, which will render us less liable to Convulsions and intestine Commotions at home, and put us out of danger of being attacked by Enemies from abroad.


The first Argument is this; That by incouraging our Settlement at 
Darien, English
 Ships that have occasion to pass by those Coasts will there be certain of a place of Retreat in case of attack either by Enemy or Tempest, without danger of being con∣fiscated by the 
Spaniards,
 and having their Men con∣demn'd to be perpetual Slaves in the Mines.


2. If we be incouraged in our 
American
 Colony, it will contribute much to heighten the Consump∣tion of the 
English
 Product; since what we have not of our own, or wherein we are wanting either as to quality or quantity, we shall supply our selves, for the use of our Plantation, in 
England;
 which may be of great benefit to the Northern Counties especially, whence we may conveniently furnish our selves with Beeves for Victualling our Ships, our own Cattel being for the most part too small for that use; besides many other things that we shall have occasion to export from 
England
 for the use of the Plantation, and to maintain a Commerce with the Natives.


3. By joining with us in this Colony, and securing a Post on the South-Sea, which the Princes of 
Da∣rien
 will no doubt very readily agree to, they may


shorten their Voyages to the 
East-Indies,
 and by that means be able to out-do all their Rivals in that Trade; but if they will be so far wanting to them∣selves, as to suffer those advantages to fall into the Hands of others who are Enemies to our Religion and common Country, they cannot blame the 
Scots,
 who have made them such fair Offers.


4. If after all, the 
English
 should continue in their Opposition to us, as their late Proclamations in 
A∣merica,
 and other Passages would seem to imply they have a mind to, the World cannot blame the 
Scots
 to provide for themselves by such other Alliances as they shall think meet; since the 
English
 are so un∣kind, especially since the Restoration of K. 
Charles
 II. to which we did so much contribute, that without our Concurrence it could never have been effected. This will appear to be incontrovertibly true, if we consider that in the time of K. 
James
 I. we were under no Restrictions as to matters of Trade more than they, except as to the Exportation of Wool, and a few other Things of 
English
 Product; and so we con∣tinu'd till the Restoration, when K. 
Charles
 II. and the 
English
 did very ungratefully lay such Preclusions and Restrictions upon us contrary to the Laws rela∣ting to the 
Postnati,
 by the 12 
Car.
 II. 
For the incou∣raging and increasing Shipping and Navigation;
 and the 15 
Car.
 II. 
For the Encouragement of Trade;
 by which we are put in the same Circumstances as to Traffick with 
France
 and 
Holland,
 and in a worse Condition than 
Ireland
 that is a Conquest; which is so much the more unreasonable, since we are always involv'd and ingag'd in the Wars betwixt 
England
 and other Countries: And those with whom they have most frequent Wars, being 
Holland
 and 
France,
 the only two Nations with whom the 
Scots
 have almost any Commerce, our Trade must of necessity sink du∣ring such Wars, whereas 
England
 hath still a great Trade to other parts of the World; and by this means we are forc'd to be sharers in their Troubles, tho' they will not allow us to partake of their Profits,


nor suffer us to take any measures to procure such as we may call our own.


It is plain from the Instance of 
Darien,
 and the Proclamations in the 
English American
 Colonies a∣gainst their Subjects entertaining any Commerce with our Settlement there, that we are in a worse condition than ever; for when any thing happens wherein the Interest of 
England
 seems to be contrary to ours, it is certainly carried against us; so that in this respect we are in a worse condition than any Foreigners, with relation to 
England;
 for if a fo∣reign People discover any thing that may be of Ad∣vantage to them, they are at liberty to pursue it by themselves, or to take in the Assistance of others; and if they find themselves aggriev'd by 
England,
 they have their respective Governments to make Application to for Redress.


To let them see that it is their Interest as well as ours it should be so, we shall only desire them to consider how fatal it may be, if by any Emergency we should be forc'd to break off the Union of the Crowns, and enter again into a 
French
 Alliance. It's in vain for them to Object, that in such a case we should betray our Religion; for we see the per∣secuted 
Hungarians
 were protected in that by the 
Turks,
 tho' sworn Enemies to it: Nor is it impossi∣ble but there may be a change as to that matter in 
France; L.
 XIV. is not immortal: And even 
Julian
 the Apostate himself found it his Interest for some time to protect the Orthodox Christians, whom he mortally hated. But supposing, (as indeed there's no great likelihood of it) that no such Alliance as this should ever happen; yet however, if these two Nations be not more closely united, it may be of ill Consequence to 
England
 if any of their Kings at any time should be so far disgusted as to betake themselves to us: What a Field of Blood and Slaughter must 
England
 have become, had we car∣ried off K. 
Charles
 I. when he came to our Army, or i
 we had join'd him against the Parliament of 
Eng∣land?



What great Efforts did a Party of our Nation make to inthrone K. 
Charles
 II. when 
England
 was against him? And how did our Concurrence after∣wards with General 
Monk
 effect it? How soon did our Espousing the Duke of 
York
's Interest turn the Tables upon those that opposed him in 
England?
 And if our Nation had likewise Espous'd his Cause before the Revolution, the Viscount of 
Dundee
 gave a sufficient proof what we could have done for him. This makes it evident, That it is not the Interest of 
England
 to slight an Union with us so much as they have done: For so long as we remain divided, any King that is so minded, may make use of us; and any envious Neighbour, whose Interest it is to keep this Island low, will be sure to blow the Coals. If they'd but turn the Tables, and make our Case their own, they would quickly be satisfied of the Truth of what we advance. Supposing that the Government of 
Scotland
 should traverse the Act∣ings of the Government of 
England,
 in relation to their Trade, &c. as they have done ours; and supposing that a Parliament of 
Scotland,
 when the King were there, should question him for the Navigation Act, and that for the Incouragement of Trade in 
England
 by King 
Charles
 II. which lays us under such hard Circumstances and Restrictions, the 
English
 would certainly very much resent it, and speedily tell us we meddled with what did not belong to us: Then why should they deny us the like liberty in reference to their Proceedings against us, seeing we are a free Nation as well as they?


Nor can any thing less than joining with us, and protecting that Settlement against all opposition in case of Attacks by the 
French,
 or others, sufficiently atone for what is already done, or heal the Wound those Proclamations have giv'n to the common In∣terest of the Island.








ANSWER.


These several Pages are no more than a Repeti∣tion of what he has urged before; with this dif∣ference only, that he intermixes them with some bitter and unseemly Expressions, which are alto∣gether insufferable in a private Person and a Sub∣ject. He as good as denounces War against 
Eng∣land
 in case the 
Scots
 should miscarry, and sounds alarm without any publick Authority. I cannot forbear to take notice of one Passage; when he says, That if the 
Scots
 had carried off K. 
Charles
 I. when he came to their Army, what a Field of Slaughter and Blood must 
England
 have become; whereas before, to excuse the 
Scots
 for their surren∣dring the said King, he had told us with a great deal of Confidence, that they were necessitated so to do. What he says concerning their Endeavours to Inthrone King 
Charles
 II. is not altogether to be denied; but he might also have remembred up∣on what Terms they did it, which is I think a sufficient warning to any King not to relie upon their Gencrosity; and he might have very well saved himself the trouble of offering the Assistance of the 
Scots
 to the 
English
 Court, there being no great likelihood, thanks be to God, at this time, that they will have any occasion for them; or if they should, they would scarce think fit to accept of them. Their Concurrence with General 
Monk
 has been spoken off before, as most of all the other Points, which he treats of here; so that we think it needless to make a Repetition of them here: And so, will take a short View of his Description of 
Darien.








WE come in the next place to give a De∣scription of the 
Isthmus
 of 
Darien.
 It lies betwixt the 8th and 10th Degrees of Northern Latitude, and in the narrowest place is betwixt 60 and 80 Italian Miles over. We shall not trouble our selves with the Description of any more of it than is in the possession of the Natives, which is in length from E. to W. on the N. side from the mouth of the River 
Darien
 to Port 
Scrivan,
 a∣bove 140 Italian Miles; from 
Caret
 Bay to the Ri∣ver of 
Cheapo
 on the Southside, it is about 160 in length. It is supposed to take its Name from the great River of 
Darien,
 that bounds its Northern Coast to the Eastward. It is bounded on the North and South with the vast Oceans that carry the names of the North and South Seas. Its Situation is very pleasant and agreeable, and very commodious for a speedy and short Communication of Trade be∣twixt the North and South Seas, and preventing that vast Compass that must otherwise be fetch'd round either of the Extremes of North and South 
America.
 By this means also it lies convenient for a speedier Communication of Trade betwixt 
Europe
 and the 
East Indies
 than any that hath hitherto been found out. Mr. 
Dampier
 says, That from 
Cheapo,
 or 
Santa Maria
 River, a Man may pass from Sea to Sea in three days, and that the 
Indians
 do it in a day and a half. There are abundance of valuable Islands on both sides the 
Isthmus,
 which prevent the breaking in of the Ocean upon it at once; and be∣sides the Conveniences of Wood, Fish, Fowl, and Water, afford good and safe Riding in all Weathers, to any number of Ships, especially those call'd the 
Sambaloes,
 that lie along the Northern Coast. The Continent is agreeably intermix'd with 
ills and Valleys of great variety, for height, depth, and ex∣tent. The Vallies are water'd with Rivers, Brooks and Springs, which take their rise from a great


ridge of Hills that run along the 
Isthmus,
 but near∣est to the Northern Shore, from which it is seldom above 15 Miles distant, and from whence the 
Sam∣baloes
 Islands, and the various Makings of the Shore, and the continued Forest all along the Country gra∣tifie the Eye with a very fine prospect. The Rivers on the Northern Coast are generally small, because their Course from the above-mentioned ridge of Hills is but short; yet the River of 
Darien
 is very large, but the depth of its entrance not answerable to its width, yet further in it is deep enough, and hath a good Harbour in 
Caret
 Bay which is some Leagues up the River, hath two Islands of pretty high Land, cloath'd with variety of Trees lying before it, and two or three Streams of fresh Water falling into it. From this Bay to the Promontory near 
Golden Island,
 the Shore is indifferently fruitful, and the Soil on the Northern Coast is generally good, but swampy here and there to the Sea.


To the Westward of the Promontory, at the en∣trance of the River, is a fine sandy Bay with three Islands, one of them 
Golden Island
 lying before it, which make it an extraordinary good Harbour. 
Golden Island
 is rocky and steep all round, except at the Landing Place on the South side, so that it is na∣turally fortifi'd. The Land of the 
Isthmus
 over against it to the S. E. is an excellent fruitful Soil. West of this Island lies the largest of the three▪ being swampy and covered with Maingroves. To the North of these lies the Island of 
Pines,
 cover'd with tall Trees fit for any use. From the Point against these Islands for three Leagues Westward▪ the Shore is guarded by Rocks, so that a Boat cannot Land; but at the N. W. end of the Rocks there's▪ very good Harbour, and good Riding as h
s been said in all Winds, by some or other of those Isl
nds, which with the adjacent Shore make a lovel
 L
dskip off at Sea. The Channel betwixt them and the 
Isth∣mus
 is two three▪ and four Miles bro
d 
nd Na∣vigable from end to end, and the Ground opposite to them within Land an excelle
t Soil, and a con∣tinued Forest of stately Timber-Trees.



On the South-side there's the River 
Sambo
 that falls into the Sea by point 
Garachina.
 This is a 
rge River. Then there's the Gulph of St. 
Michael,
 made by the Outlet of several considerable Rivers, as those of 
Santa Maria
 and 
Congo,
 and the 
Gold-River,
 so call'd because of the great plenty of Gold Dust it affords to the 
Spaniards.
 The River 
Congo
 may be entred at High-water, and affords a good Harbour. The Gulph has several Islands in it, and affords good Riding in many places. The Country on this side, as on the other, is one continued Forest; and forms a Bay call'd the Bay of 
Panama,
 abounding with fine Islands, and affording good Riding for Ships. The Soil of the Inland Country is for the most part a black fruitful Mold.


The Weather is much the same as in other places of the Torrid Zone in this Latitude, but inclining to the wet extreme, for two thirds of the year, the Rains beginning in 
April.


The most remarkable of their Trees are the 
Cotton
 Tree, which bears a Cod as big as a Nutmeg full of short Wool or Down, and affords Timber for Ca∣noes and Periagoes; they abound with stately 
Cedars
 and 
Macaw
 Trees, which bear a Fruit as big as a small Pear, of a tart but not unpleasant Taste; 
Bibby
 Tree, the Wood hard and black as Ink, and being tapp'd▪ affords a Liquor call'd 
Bibby,
 of a pleasant tart taste, which the 
Indians
 drink. They have abundance of 
Plantains
 set in Walks, which make very delightful Groves, and yield an excellent Fruit, and being green and sappy, are cut down with one stroak of an Ax. They have also plenty of 
Bona∣noes
 another sort of Plantain, which eats best raw as the Plantain does boil'd. They have great store of that excellent Fruit call'd 
Pine-Apples,
 which tastes like a Mixture of all delicious Fruits, and ripens at all times of the year. They have also 
Prickle-P
ar
 which is a very good Fruit; and 
Sugar-Canes,
 of which they make no other use but to suck out the Juice. The 
Maho
-Tree, of which they make Ropes, Cables for Ships, and Nets for fishing.


The 
Calabash
 whose Shells serve for Cups and other occasions, is curiously painted; the sweet sort of 'em is eatable, and the bitter sort Medicinal. They have also 
Gourds
 of the like nature. There's a Plant they call 
Silk Grass
 which resembles our Flags; this they beat into strings like fine Flax, much stronger than our Flax or Hemp; of these they make Ropes, Cordage of all sorts, Nets for small Fish; and the 
Spaniards
 and others use it for Shoemakers Thread, Stockings, and a sort of Lace. They have a Tree call'd 
Lightwood,
 as large as an Elm, but so light, that a Man may carry a great quantity of it on his back. It is in substance like Cork, and made use of by the 
Indians
 for Rafters to go to Sea, or pass Rivers. They have a Tree call'd 
Whitewood
 of a finer Grain, and whiter than any European Wood, and fit for inlaying. They have 
Tamarind, Locust-Tree, Ba∣stard Cinnamon, Bamboes,
 and 
Maingrove
-Trees in plenty. They have Shrubs that bear store of Pep∣per of two sorts, call'd Bell Pepper, and Bird-Pep∣per.


Mr. 
Wafer,
 to whom we owe this Description, takes notice of a 
Redwood,
 whereof there grow great quantities on the Northern Coast; the 
Indians
 make use of it for Dying, and mix a kind of Earth they have with it. It makes a bright glossy lively Red, which no washing can fetch out again. This we suppose to be the 
Nicaragua
 Wood. Their Roots are Potatoes, Kams, and Cassava; of the last of which they make Bread. They have likewise To∣bacco, but don't understand the Planting and Ma∣nuring of it; it is not so strong as that of 
Vir∣ginia.


Their Beasts are the 
Peccary,
 and 
Waree
 a kind of wild Hogs, which are very good Meat. They have considerable store of Deer and Rabbits, and great droves of Monkies, which are extraordinary fat and good to Eat. They have an Insect call'd a 
Soldier,
 somewhat resembling a Crab, which seeds up∣on what falls from the Tree, is a delicious Meat, and yeilds an Oil that is an excellent Salve. They have no European Cattle.



Their Birds are the 
Chicaly-Chicaly,
 which makes a noise somewhat like a Cuccoo, is a large Bird▪ has Feathers of divers Colours very beautiful and lively, whereof the Natives sometimes make Aprons. This Bird keeps mostly on the Trees, feeds on Fruit, and is pretty good Me
t. The 
Quam
 feeds in the same manner, his Wings are dun, his Tail dark▪ short, and upright. He is much preferable to the other for Meat. There's a 
Russ
t colour'd Bird,
 resem∣bling a Partridge, runs most on the ground, and is excellent Meat. The 
Corosou
 is a large Fowl as big as a Turky, and of a black colour. The 
Cock
 has a fine Crown of yellow Feathers on his Head, and Gills like a Turky. They live on Trees, and eat Fruit. They sing very delightfully, and are so well imitated by the 
Indians,
 that they discover their haunts by it. They are very good Meat, but their Bones make the Dogs run mad, and are therefore hid from them by the 
Indians.
 They have abundance of 
Parrots,
 for size and shape much like those of 
Ja∣maica,
 they are very good Meat. Their 
Parakites
 are most of them green, and go in large Flights by themselves. They have 
Macaw
 Birds which are as big again as Parrots▪ and resemble them in shape. They have a Bill like a Hawk, and a bushy Tail, with 2 or 3 long stragling Feathers, either red or blue; but those of the Body are of a lovely blue, green and red. The 
Indians
 tame those Birds and them to speak: and then letting them go into the Woods amongst the wild ones, they will return of their own accord to the Houses. They exactly imitate the Voices and Singing of the 
Indians,
 and call the 
Chicaly
 in its own Note. It is one of the pleasantest Birds in the World and its flesh sweet and well tasted. They have also 
W
odpeckers
 which are p
ed like our Magpies, and have long Claws that they climb up Trees with they are not pleasant to E
t. They have plenty of Dunghil fowl resem∣bling those of 
E
pe
 and their Flesh and Eggs as well tasted as ours. About the 
Sambaloes
 the
 h
ve great store of Sea-fowl, and particularly Pelicans


which are large Birds, having Legs and Feet like a Goose and a Neck like a Swan, the Feathers are grey. It has a Bag under its Throat, which when fill'd is as large as a Man's two Fists; and when dry, will hold a pound of Tobacco; they feed upon Fish and the young ones are good Meat. They have also 
Cormorants
 resembling Ducks for size and shape, are of a black Colour, have a white spot on the Breast, and pitch sometimes on Trees and Shrubs by the water side. They are too rank to be eaten. They have abundance of Sea-Gulls and Pies, which are pretty good meat, but eat fishy, which is cur'd by burying 'em 8 or 10 hours in the Sand with their Feathers on. They have flying Insects too, and among others Bees, which form their Hives on Trees, and it's observ'd, That they never sting any body: The Natives mix the Honey with Water, and so drink it, but know not the use of the Wax. They have shining Flies, which in the night time resemble Glow-worms.


Their Fish are the 
Tarpom,
 which eats like Sal∣mon; some of 'em weigh 50 or 60 pound: They afford good Oil. They have 
Sharks,
 and another Fish that resembles a 
S
ark▪
 but much better Meat. The 
C
vally
 is much of the size of a Maccarel, and very good Meat. They have a Fish call'd 
Old Wives,
 which is also very good to Eat. Their 
Paracoods
 are as large as a well-grown Pike, and very good Meat; but in some particular places poisonous, which are distinguished by the Liver. Their 
Gar
-Fish is good Meat, they have a long Bone on their Snout, with which they will sometimes pierce the side of a Ca∣noe. They have also 
Sculpins,
 a prickly Fish, which when strip'd, is very good Meat. They have likewise 
String rays, Parrotfish, Snooks, Conger-Eels, Conchs. Periwinkles, Limpits, Sea-Crabs,
 and 
Craw Fish▪
 and other sorts whose Names we know not, that Eat very well.


The Inhabitants are most numerous on the North of the 
Ist
us;
 the Men usually 5 or 6 foot high, streight, clean limb'd, big-bon'd, handsomely shap'd,


nimble, active, and run well. The Women are short and thick, and not so lively as the Men; the young Women plump, well-shap'd, and have a brisk Eye: Both Sexes have a round Visage, short bottle Noses, large and grey Eyes, high Forehead, white even Teeth, thin Lips, pretty large Mouths, well proportion'd Cheeks and Chins, and in general, handsome; but the Men exceed the Women. Both Sexes have streight long lank black Hair, which they generally wear down to the middle of their Back. All other Hair but that of their Eye-brows and Eye-lids they pull up by the Roots, cut off the Hair of their Heads, and paint themselves black by way of Triumph, when they kill a 
Spaniard.
 Their natural Complexion is a Copper colour, and their Eye-brows black as Jet. There are some among them of both Sexes, which bear the proportion of 2 or 3 to a hundred, who are milk white, and have all their Bodies cover'd over with a milk white Down; their Hair is of the same Colour, and very fine, about 6 or 8 Inches long, and inclining to curl. They are less in Stature than the other 
In∣dians,
 and their Eye-lids point downwards in form of a Crescent; they don't see well in the Sun, their Eyes being weak and running with Water if the Sun shine upon them, therefore they are call'd Moon-eye'd. They are weak and sluggish in the day time, but in Moon-shiny nights all life and activity, and run as fast through the Woods by night, as the other 
Indians
 do by day: They are not so much respected as the other 
Indians,
 but look'd upon as monstrous. The Natives go naked both Men and Women, on∣ly the Men have a thing like an Extinguisher of sil∣ver or gold Plate tied round their middle to cover their Yard, and the Women tie a piece of Cloth be∣fore them, which comes as low as their Knee; but they use none of those Precautions till they come to the years of Puberty; the Men that have not those Extinguishers, make use of a piece of a Plantain-Leaf of a Conick Figure. They are in general, a modest and cleanly People, and have a value for


Cloths if they had them. The better sort have long Cotton Garments shap'd like Carmens Frocks, which they use on solemn Occasions, as attending the King or Chief, &c. For an Ornament to the Face, besides their general painting and daubing, the Men wear a piece of Plate hanging over their Mouths, and the Chief of them have it of Gold. It is of an Oval Form, and gently pinching the Bridle of the Nose with its points, hangs dangling from thence as low as the under Lip; and instead of this the Wo∣men wear a Ring through the Bridle of the Nose: They lay them aside at their Feasts. They likewise wear Chains of Teeth, Shells, Beads, or the like; the heavier they be, they reckon them the more Ornamental. Their Houses lie mostly scattering, and always by a River▪side, but in some places they are so many as to form a Town or Village. Their Walls are made up of Sticks, and daub'd over with Earth: The Fire is in the middle of the House, and the Smoke goes out at a Hole in the Roof: They are not divided into Stories or Rooms, but into Hovels; every one has a Hammock for a Bed in one of those Hovels. They have no Doors, Shelves, or Seats, other than Logs of Wood. Every Neighbourhood has a Warr-house of 130 foot long, the Sides and Ends full of Holes, whence they shoot their Arrows on the approach of the 
Spaniards.
 In their Plantations they set so much Plaintain, Maiz, &c. as serves their occasions: They likewise make Drink of Maiz, which they ferment by Grains of the same chewed in their Mouths: They have also another sort of Drink, which they make of Plan∣tains. Most of the Drudgery is perform'd by the Women with great cheerfulness, being very well condition'd, and dutiful to their Husbands, who are otherwise very indulgent to them, and their Chil∣dren. The Women wash the Mother and Child in a River within an hou
 after Delivery. The Boys are bred to the Bow, Hunting, and Fishing, &c. at which they are mighty dexterous; and th
 Girls help the Women in dressing their Victuals,


Weaving, making Cotton Cloth, Cordage, Nets, &c. and the Men make Baskets very neat, dying the Materials first with lively Colours▪ They allow Poligamy, but punish Adultery with the Death of both Parties: They punish Theft also with Death; and Fornication with thrusting a Briar up the Man's Yard, whereof they commonly Die. The Facts must be prov'd by Oath, which is a swearing by their Tooth. When they Marry, the Father or nearest Kinsman keeps the Bride privately in his own Apartments the first seven Nights, and then she is deliver'd to her Husband: All the Neighbours for some Miles round are invited to a great Feast, and bring Provisions with them: The Fathers of the young Couple bring them forth in their hands, and the Bridegroom's Father makes a Spcech; then he dances about in antick Gestures till all on a sweat, when he kneels down, and gives his Son to the Bride, her Father also having danc'd himself into a Sweat, and presenting her to the Bridegroom in the same manner; then they take each other by the hand, and so the Ceremony concludes. After this all the Men take up their Axes, and run shouting to a Tract of Wood-Land, to prepare a Planta∣tion for the new Couple. That being done, They have their Feast, and afterwards drink hard, all their Arms being first put out of the way, to prevent Danger in case of quarrelling. They divert them∣selves by Dancing, and Piping on a small hollow Bamboe, but without distinction of Notes: The Men and Women never Dance nor Feast together, but apart. The Women accompany them likewise in their hunting Expeditions, which sometimes last 20 days: They tie their Hammocks betwixt two Trees cover them with Plaintain Leaves, and have Fires all night by their Hammocks: Such of their Prey as they take a 
unting, and design to keep for future use, they barbecue in the Woods; and what they make use of for present Sustenance, they mix with Roots Plantain▪ Bonanoes, and Pepper, and stew it together till it be brought to a Pulp; which


they take up with the two foremost Fingers of their right Hand bent hookwise, and put into their Mouths. They travel by direction of the Sun, or the bending of the Trees, according as the Wind is. None of the 
English
 Authors take notice of their Worship or Religion, but give an account that they Pawaw, or Consult the Devil to know Futurities: And it would seem they are as ignorant in matters of Physick and Chirurgery, since when they would let a Patient Blood, they set him upon the Bank of a River, and with a little Bow, and small Arrow, gag'd that it may enter no further than our Lancets, they shoot as fast as they can at all parts of the Pa∣tient's Body; and if they chance to hit on a Vein, that the Blood spurts out a little, they testifie their Joy by Antick Dances.


WE come next to give an Account of their Set∣tlement of our Men there; how they were receiv'd by the Natives; what 
Indian
 Princes there are in their Neighbourhood; in what state they found the Affairs of the Country; and of the Situ∣ation of our Colony.


On the 27th of 
October
 1698. our Ships came to an Anchor in a fair sandy Bay, three Leagues W. off the Gulph of 
Darien;
 upon which, two Ca∣noes, with several 
Indians
 came on board, were very free with our Men, told them they had been long expected, and were very welcome: Our Men gave them some old Hats, Looking glasses, and Knives, with which they were extremely well pleas'd, and went off. When our Ships stood fur∣ther into the Bay, they saw about 20 
Indians
 drawn up on the Shore, being arm'd with Bows and Lances; upon which a Boat being sent ashoar, and making a signal of Peace, they unstruug their Bows, talk'd familiarly, and told our Men, that two Great Cap∣tains would in a little time come on board our Ships. Accordingly, on 
November
 the 2d, in the morning, Captain 
Andreas,
 one of their Princes, accompanied by 12 Men, came on board, and ask'd their Busi∣ness:


He was answered, That we came to live among them, and Trade with them, and would af∣ford them 
European
 Commodities cheaper than any other People. He ask'd if we were Friends or Ene∣mies to the 
Spaniards;
 and was answered, that we were at Peace with all Men, and would make War upon no Man, except they injur'd us. He took us for Buccaneers, and told us, He knew Captain 
Swan
 and Captain 
Davis
 in the South-Sea, and com∣mended them as Men of Valour. We heard that part of his Discourse with much Coldness, and told him we came on no such design as those Men did, but had Authority for what we undertook. We treated him civilly, gave him a Hat lac'd with Gold, and some Toys: And so he parted, promising in a little time to come again; which he accordingly did, and brought 
Don Pedro,
 another of their Princes or Captains, with him. Captain 
Andreas
 was freer with us than at first, plainly own'd that he took us for Buccaneers, and complain'd that some 
Eng∣lishmen
 of that sort had after great pretences of Friendship, carried off some of their People; and therefore 
Don Pedro
 would not come aboard us till he had further assurance of us.


Captain 
Andreas
 is a Person of a small stature; he affects the 
Spanish
 Gravity, as having been often among them at the Mines of 
Santa Maria, Pana∣ma,
 &c. and formerly had a Commission under them as a Captain, upon which he values himself above others: The 
French
 hate him mortally, because of something he did against some of their Nation for∣merly. When he came on board us, he had a sort of a Coat of red loose Stuff, an old Hat, a pair of Drawers, but no Stockings nor Shoes; and the rest that came with him were all naked, excepting their 
Penis,
 which was covered by Extinguishers, as for∣merly mention'd.


Upon further Communing, Captain 
Andreas
 was very well pleas'd with us, offered us what part of the Country we would chuse, and accepted a Com∣mission from us; and at the same time we gave


him a Basket-hilted Sword, and a pair of Pistols; upon which he promised to defend us to the last of his Blood.


Some of the Princes on this side the 
Isthmus
 had been in Peace with the 
Spaniards
 for several years, and suffered a few of them to reside amongst them, to give notice to 
Panama
 of what Ships came upon these Coasts; but upon some fresh disgust, about two months before we arriv'd, Captain 
Ambrosio,
 who is the most noted Prince amongst 'em, had ob∣lig'd them to enter into a common Alliance against 
Spain,
 and cut off ten 
Spaniards,
 who liv'd upon 
Golden Island.


The Place where we are settled is four miles East of 
Golden Island,
 within a great Bay. We have an excellent Harbour, surrounded with high Moun∣tains, capable of holding a thousand Sail Land-lock'd, and safe from all Winds and Tempests. The Mouth of the Harbour is about random Cannon∣shot over, form'd by a 
Peninsula
 on the one side, and a point of Land on the other. In the middle of the Entrance there is a Rock three foot above Water, upon which the Sea breaks most terribly when the Wind blows hard; and within the Points there is a small Rock that lies a little under Water. On both sides these Rocks there's a very good wide Channel for Ships to come in: That on the South-side is 3 Cables long, and 7 Fathom deep; and that on the North two Cables long. From the two outermost points the Harbour runs away East a Mile and an half; and near the middle, on the right hand, a point of Land shoots out into the Bay; so that by raising Forts on the said Point, on the Rock in the middle of the Entrance, and the two outer-most Points, it will be the strongest Harbour, both by Art and Nature, that's in the known World. The Bay within is for the most part 6 Fathom Water, and till you come within a Cable's length of the Shoar, three Fathom and an half: So that a Key may be built, to which great Ships may lay their Sides, and unload. The 
Peninsula
 lies on the Left-Hand,


is a mile and a half in length, very steep, and high towards the Sea: So that it would be ve∣ry difficult for any body to Land, till you come to the 
Isthmus,
 where there's a small sandy Bay that lit∣tle Ships may put into, but is easie to be secured by a Ditch and a Fort. There are several little Rivers of very good Water that fall into the Bay; and it abounds so with excellent Fish, that we can with ease take more than it's possible for us to destroy, having sometimes caught 140 at a Draught: A∣mongst others there be Tortoises, which are excel∣lent Meat, and some of them above 600 weight.


The 
Peninsula
 was never inhabited, and is cover'd all over with Trees of various sorts; as stately Ce∣d
rs, Brasil-wood, 
Lignum Vitae,
 Box-Wood, Fu∣stick-wood, Yellow Sanders, Manshinel, &c. and the like sorts, besides others whose Names we know not, grow on the Continent; and we doubt not of finding out the 
Nicaragua
-Wood: We have found Cabbage-Trees, the Fruit of which eats like Colly-Flowers. The Natives have no Plantation within two Miles of us.


We have a Watch-Tower upon an high Hill ad∣joining to our Plantation, about a Mile South of the Bay; from whence we can see the Ships in the Bay, the Fort we have raised on the Bay, and as far as the Mouth of the River 
Darien:
 We can see a∣bove 30 miles Southward, and have a fine Prospect of 
Golden Island,
 and the 
Isl
 of Pines,
 Westward to∣wards 
Porto-Bello,
 and Northward towards 
Jamaica.
 The Hill is about a Mile in height; so that we can see any Ships before they come within some Leagues of the Harbour. We compute our selves to be a∣bout 50 Leagues North of 
Carthagena,
 and as much South of 
Porto-Bello.
 The Four 
Indian
 Kings or Captains on this Coast visit us frequently in their Canoes; and the Natives are very kind to us, and sell us Plaintains, Fowls &c. for Toys or old Shifts. A 
Frenchman,
 who hath Married one of the Na∣tives, informs us, That the 
Spaniards
 have Silver and Mines on the 
Isthmus,
 which we might make our


selves Masters of with a 100 Men; so that if they commit Hostilities upon us, as we hear they threat∣en to do, it's not unlikely that we may visit them. We found some 
French
 Refugees in the Country, who are willing to settle under us; and having been several years in these Parts, and understanding the Language of the Natives, are very useful to us. We have seen some Sand in the Rivers, which looks as if it were mixt with Gold, and in some places the Earth seems to be very much mixt with it: So that it's concluded there's more Gold-Dust here, than in any part of 
Guinea.


The 
Indian
 Princes or Captains on this Coast do somewhat resemble our Heads of Clans in 
Scotland;
 and by their Converse at times with the 
Spaniards,
 and other 
European
 Nations, affect Christian Names. The first of these Princes we shall name is Captain 
Diego;
 he commands from the bottom of the Gulph of 
Orba
 on this side 
Caret
 Bay, and has 3000 Men under him; he has been at War with the 
Spaniards
 several years, occasion'd by an Insult his People had receiv'd from them, when they came to demand their share in the Mines which they had discover'd to the 
Spaniards
 in their Country, on condition of being Partners with them: But when they came to demand it, the 
Spaniards
 treated them villanously; beat and abus'd them; upon which they attack'd the 
Spaniards,
 cut off 20 of their Men, and three Priests that belong'd to the Mines.


The next is Captain 
Pousigo.
 He is an 
Indian
 Clergy-man, and Brother-in-Law to Captain 
An∣dreas.
 The Peninsula that we possess, lies betwixt his Territory and that of Captain 
Andreas,
 who together with his Brother, commands from 
Golden Island
 to the River 
Pinas.
 Their Command is greater than that of 
Pousigo,
 but not so great as that of 
Diego.
 These Princes are very useful to us, because of their Neighbourhood and Consanguinity to one another.



Captain 
Ambrosio
 commands from the River 
Pinas
 to the 
Samballoes:
 He is a Man of about 60 years of Age, but strong and vigorous, well limb'd, and of a stern Countenance: He is a mortal Enemy to the 
Spaniards,
 with whom he hath had a long War: He is esteemed the bravest of all the 
Indian
 Captains. His Son-in-Law 
Don Pedro
 having been taken by the 
Spaniards,
 and kept by them as a Slave at 
Panama,
 he can never forget nor forgive it them: This young Man is a great Friend to the 
French,
 who they are made to believe design to come and settle among them. 
Ambrosio
 and his Son-in-Law prest us much to come and settle in their Dominions, and join with them to make War on the 
Spaniards:
 We gave them fair Words, and promis'd to come and view their Coasts, which we accordingly did; and in our way thither, four Leagues Westward of our Settlement, we found an excellent Harbour, capable of 10000 Sail; but it can't be defended without many Forts: Here the Privateers us'd to come and careen. Cap∣tain 
Ambrosio
's House lies about a League from the Water-side, on the Bank of a River, having twelve lesser Houses about it: When we drew near it, he advanced 50 Paces to meet us, being attended by 20 Men in white loose Frocks with Fringes round the bottom, and arm'd with Lances: He saluted us kindly, and gave us a Calabash of Liquor almost like Lambs-wool, made of 
Indian
 Corn and Pota∣toes. His House is 90 foot long, 35 broad, and 30 in height, curiously thatch'd with Palmetto-Royal, and over that Cotton-Leaves. The Floor is of firm Earth like Tarras, very smooth and clean. The sides are compos'd of large Canes, as thick as a Man's Leg. In this House live 
Ambrosio
 and his Son-in-Law 
Don Pedro,
 with both their Families, consisting of about 40 Persons. We saw 
Ambrosio
's Grandmother there, who is 120 years old, and yet was very active in getting things ready for an En∣tertainment. She has six Generations descended from her now in the House with her. The People live here to 150 and 160 years of Age; but those


that converse much with 
Europeans,
 and drink strong Drink don't live so long.


From the 
Samballoes
 to the River of 
Conception,
 the Country is commanded by one 
Corbet,
 who is alto∣gether in the 
French
 Interest, he having contracted a Friendship with their Priveteers 7 years ago, and done them many good Offices. They promised to reward him if he would go to 
Petit Guaves,
 and in his way thither he was taken by an 
English
 Privateer and carried to 
Jamaica,
 whence the Governor of 
Petit Guaves
 got him releas'd. He was with 
Ponti
 at the taking of 
Carthagena,
 and has a Commission from the 
French
 to be General of all the 
French
 and 
Indian
 Forces on that Coast, and to take, sink, and destroy 
Spaniards
 or any other Enemies. Yet the 
French
 themselves, and the sensible part of the 
Indians,
 don't put any confidence in him; and 
Ambrosio,
 who is the bravest of all those 
Indian
 Captains, keeps him in Awe and within Bounds.


Next to 
Corbet,
 there's another of their Captains call'd 
Nicola,
 who is said to be a wise, brave and good natur'd Prince; insomuch that the 
Indians
 had a mind to have set him up instead of 
Ambrosio,
 who is of a rugged military Temper. But 
Ambrosio
's Authority and Power is so great, that they did not find it practicable. 
Nicola
 is a mortal Enemy to the 
Spaniards,
 and can never entertain a good thought of them, since the Governor of 
Porto-Bello
 robb'd him of a curious Fusee that had been presented him by some of the Buccaneers; and being out of order, he sent it thither to be mended; upon which the Governour taking a liking to it, kept it to him∣self, and sent 
Nicola
 another sorry piece instead of it.


Since we came hither, there have been an 
Eng∣lish,
 a 
Dutch,
 and a 
French
 Ship in our Bay. The 
English
 Ship was Captain 
Long
 in the 
Rupert
 Prize; He had been in the Gulf of 
O
ba,
 but he himself and his Men own'd, that they had not then been ashore there. He hath some way or other disoblig'd the Captains 
Ambrosio
 and 
Diego.
 Tho' we treated him


with all possible Civility, yet we are since inform'd that he hath been a days Journey into the Gulf, and endeavour'd to incense the 
Indians
 against us, telling them that we were Privateers, and that the King of 
England
 would not protect us. He left some Men in the Bay, who had since kill'd some 
Spaniards,
 and came to us for Arms and Ammuni∣tion, but we told them, we could not grant them any, and that they had done what they could not justifie. We gave them however what was neces∣sary for sitting up a Boat; and as a Reward, they intic'd away the Carpenter and Mate of one of our Ships call'd the 
Ʋnicorn.


The 
Dutch
 Ship that came hither was afraid of the Spanish 
Barl
vento
 Fleet, and put in here for Protection, that Fleet having made Prize of ano∣ther 
Dutch
 Ship of 32 Guns▪ and of two 
English
 Sloops for Trading on those Coasts.


The 
French
 Ship that put in here, was that which was order'd to carry back the Church Plate, &c. to 
Carthagena,
 did afterwards bulge on a Rock, and was cast away in our Harbour. We sav'd all their lives, and Captain 
Pincarton
 our Commodore endan∣ger'd his own life to save that of the 
French
 Captain. He inform'd us, That the 
French
 had four Men of War of 50 Guns each, who thinking we had a Design on the River 
Mississipi,
 were gone to the Gulf of 
Mexico
 in quest of us. The 
French
 have been ve∣ry industrious in cultivating their Interest, both with the Natives and 
Spaniards
 in this part of 
Ame∣rica,
 and doubt not of having a good share in those Countries after the King of 
Spain
's Death. They have got a great Interest with Captain 
Ambrosio
 by means of his Son-in-Law 
Don Pedro,
 whom they caress extreamly, and design'd to have carried him to 
Petit Guavus,
 and from thence into 
France,
 to acquaint the 
French
 King with the favourable Sen∣timents the 
Indians
 have entertain'd of the 
French,
 and of their design to surrender themselves to his Majesty.



This has been projected by the 
French
 a long time, but the King of 
Spain
's Indisposition▪ and their Pre∣tensions to that Crown, made them refer it: and there's no doubt but our Settlement will quicken those Resolutions. Captain 
Andreas,
 Captain 
Pedro
 his Brother, Captain 
Diego,
 and Captain 
Pousigo
 our Neighbours have no manner of Correspondence with the 
French.
 The latter hath acquainted us that there are several Gold Mines within two Miles of our Settlement which he hath promis'd to shew us; and he hath actually let us see several Samples of fine Gold.


This being the Substance of several Journals that were sent from our Colony in 
Darien
 upon their first Settlement there, we hope it's sufficient of it self to satisfie our Neighbours in 
England
 of the Justice of our Cause, of the Equity of our Proceedings, of the true Reason why the 
French
 are so much our Ene∣mies in this matter, of the greatness of the Provi∣dence that has put us in possession of that Post, and that it is 
England
's Interest to joyn with and protect us, by which the Designs of the 
French
 against 
Eu∣rope
 in general▪ and 
Great Britain
 in particular, may be defeated▪ and the 
English West-India
 Trade se∣cur'd. But since by the Proclamations before▪men∣
on'd▪ our Ships may be in danger of being at∣tack'd by other Nations as Pirates, and our Co∣lony discountenanc'd, and oppos'd on that Ac∣count by the Natives; there's no reason that our Neighbours should think strange if we complain of that unkind usage, and endeavour to lay before them what may probably be the Consequences of such Pro∣ceedings▪ without being construed either to threaten or to wish that any such things should happen: 
t being evident that by offering to admit the 
English
 as Joint-sharers in our Trade, we entertain no Sen∣timents but what are friendly towards that Nation, being satisfied that all those who wish well to the Protestant Religion and true Liberty, are Enemies to any thing that may occasion a Breach of the Union and good Understanding betwixt us. Yet it


must be own'd, that we have but too great rea∣son to complain of the Hardships we suffer, which it is in the power of 
England
 to remedy, by complying with the gracious Proposals of Uniting the Nations, repeated in Parliament by His Majesty, who like a true Father of His Country, has expos'd himself to the greatest of Dangers to procure the Welfare and Peace of His Subjects, by which He has made an absolute Con∣quest of the Hearts of all good Men, who are una∣nimous to join in the like Prayer for him, that the 
Israelites
 of old put up for their Kings, 
viz. That he may live for ever.




FINIS.
