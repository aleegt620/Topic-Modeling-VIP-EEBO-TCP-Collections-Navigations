To his
ROYALL HIGHNES
the
PRINCE
Of
ORANGE.


Great SIR,


P
Rovidence the
wise disposer of
us all, sending
me abroad to seeke bread


in a strange land, gave
me the good fortune to
be a spectator of some of
the Heroick Actions of
your 
Royall Highnesse,

not only at the takeing
of 
Narden,
 and the 
Grave

from the 
French,
 but at
severall other places; I
have been also happy in
liveing long in the 
Hague

where for severall yeares
I had the opportunitie of
observeing, (or rather
Admiring) your 
High∣nesse

wise direction and

Government
 in the seve∣rall▪

Colledges
 of the



States,
 where some times
your 
Highnesse
 hath been
pleased to Act the part
of the 
Pensionarie
 during
his Indisposition; But
why doe I speake of these
things? All the world
knowes that your 
Highnes

hath wrestelled with and
overcome the greatest
Difficulties Imaginable,
not feareing the frownes
and unjust proceedings
of some, who by force of
Armes detaine part of
your 
Highnesses
 sovera∣nity
and inheritance, nor
could the large Proffers


and Advantages offered
to you by some, at any
time shake that sted∣fastnes
and Princely re∣solution
your 
Highnesse

ever had to stand by
and dye for the Intrest
of the 
Common-wealth;

No 
God
 hath certainely
chosen your 
Highnesse

to be a 
Moises
 to goe
in and out before his

People,
 and to be a glory
to the 
Royall Familie
 of
the 
Stewards.
 And now
great Sir I want words
to beg your 
Highnes

pardon for the high pre∣sumption


of Dedicating
this small piece to your

Highnes.
 All I can say is
that it would be an infi∣nite
joy to me if I could
possiblie doe any thing
to engage your 
Highnesse

to look upon and ac∣cept
of these 
Remarks,

as comming in all sub∣mission,
from him who
shall never cease to im∣plore
the 
Throne
 of

Grace
 to preserve your

Highnesse
 to be the most
eminent Instrument in
his own hand, for the
good of Church and



Common-wealth;
 so
prayes,


Your Highnesse Most devote and Humble Servant
W
L: CARR.








To the
READER.


T
Here is nothing more odious
(and I am sure nothing that
I hate more) then to be re∣corded
a foole in print, and
yet I must be scribling; But when I
consider that the best of pens have
mett with the like misfortune, by
being severely censured, by the Witt

of the Towne, I am the more encou∣raged
to stand their Shott. I know
the Criticks of the Age will take my
remarkes in peeces, the one calling me
a Commonwealths man will say, I
have flattered the Government of
Holland too much, others will say
I have been to fevere in painting out
the Defects of some Countryes, and
Governments: and there is yet ano∣ther
sort that will say I am an Opi∣niator
of an English man, in prai∣seing
so much myne owne Country;
To all which I shall answer, that I


never designed to please the Wits
of the time; what I have done hath
been to Comply with the desires of
some friends who designed to Tra∣vell,
and therefore Ingaged me to
print some of the remarks I made
in my Travells, Dureing my 16
yeares liveing abroad. This being the
truth of the matter, I hope the cur∣teous
Reader will passe by any faults
on the method I have used in dis∣cribing
some Countryes, which is
all I beg, who am yours &c.


W. C.












Some Necessarie
REMARKS
for such as Entend to
TRAVEL
Thro the Province of
HOLLAND.


A
S they that confine them∣selves
to their own coun∣trie
have not the oppor∣tunitie
to see and observe
Rarities in other parts of the
world: so such as goe into forrain
places, rather wander at Random
then travel, who hane not the Cu∣riositie
to Commit to memorie or
writing such things they meet with,
both for thier own and others Satis∣faction,
as may Demonstrate the
fruits of their travels.


I Confesse all Travellers are not


of alike Temper: Some delight
themselves in contemplation of the
curiosities of 
Arts,
 som are taken
with the varieties of the works of
nature, others speculate with a kind
of Reverence the decays and ruins
of 
Antiquitie,
 others studiously in∣form
themselves with the trans∣actions
of 
Modern tymes,
 others
with thee 
Gouvernment
 and 
Politie,

other speculate the strange customs
and fashion of the places they passe
thro; To be short everie one labors
to entertain the reader with those
objects and rarities of forain parts,
his 
Genius
 and inclination is most
affected with.


As to my self, although during
the space of 16 yeaves travel, I
might have inlarged, according to
the curiositie and opportunitie I have
had in the rehearsal of many rare
and exquisite things verie observa∣ble:
yet my chiefe aime was to make
such remarks, as might most con∣tribute
to the common good of hu∣mane


society and Civil life, in taking
notice of the 
Government
 and 
poli∣tie

of the several 
States
 and 
Domi∣nions

where I have been, viz. The

Ʋnited Provinces, Germany, Den∣mark,
Sweden,
 and other coun∣tries,
whose natural temper and
disposition seemed to me most to
sympathise with our 
English nation,

and thereby have an occasion to do
some good to my own countrie.
Expect not 
Reader
 alike punctualnes,
as to all the forementioned places,
because verie many things which I
might have observed, are much
agreeing, and so may be referred,
to what shal be spoken of the 
Poli∣tie

and 
Goverment
 of 
Holland,

which, for reasons I shal by and by
hint at, is the Chiese End I aimed
at in this treatise.


We wil begin then in the first
place with the 
Common-wealth
 of

Holland,
 and Dominions of the

States General
 which for some yeares
hath bin in a declining condition,


and their forces exceedingly wea∣kned,
by reason of that fatal war
it managed against 
England, France

and the 
Bishop
 of 
Munster,
 unto
which if we ad the Intestime divisions
of those two factions, the Prince
of 
Orange
 and 
Lovestein,
 that 
Po∣litick
body
 was so tottered and torn,
as did threaten its utter and total
ruine.


But as bodies whither 
natural
 or

Politick,
 after that a violent fit hath
sore shaken, dissipated and exhau∣sted
their spirits, may recover vigor
and look-lively again, if so be the
radical constitution and natural tem∣per
be not wholie changed and
depraved: even so This 
Common∣wealth

of 
Holland
 hath visibly reco∣vered
strength again, and probaly
may attain to its former 
force
 and

Lustre,
 except som depravation in its
vital humous should stil keep it
languishing, and obstruct its per∣fect
cure.


We wil therefore make some re∣marks


as to the defects and faylings
(observed not onely by me but also
by others) which that famous 
Com∣monwealth

hath of late yeares bin
guiltie of: which I shal doe not out
of any malice or disigne of reflection,
the intention of writing this treatise
being simplie to insert those de∣faults,
which the wisest of Authors
have alwayes Judged necessarie not
onely for the reformation of this,
but of all 
states
 whatsoever.


This 
Commonwealth
 of 
Holland

hath worthily bin the wonder of all
Europe during this last age, and
perhaps not to be paralled in the re∣cords
of former tymes: for if we con∣sider
how many yeares it was assaul∣ted
by the then most 
Potent Prince

of 
Europe,
 who aspired to no les then
the 
Ʋniversal Empire,
 and that how
formidable soever he were, yet they
not onely maintained their preten∣sions,
but with uninterrupted pro∣speritie
and succesfulnesse advan∣ced
their trade, and spread their


conquests in all the foure parts of the
world.


Rome
 it self though most famous
and victorious, yet could not, as
is believed, in so short a time do,
what by this 
Commonwealth
 hath
bin effected. In 
India
 and 
Affrica

they soon forced the 
Spaniard,
 and

Portugeses
 to yeeld to them most of
their trade and posessions. And tho

England
 put in for a share, yet they
were a long while vigourously op∣posed
by the 
Dutch,
 and to this
hour have enough to do, to keep
what they have gotten: so that in
lesse then an hundred years this 
Com∣monwealth

by their industrie and art
in trading, are becom so excessive
rich and potent that they began to in∣sult
and would needs be Arbitraters
to their neighbouring 
Princes
 and

States,
 and encroach upon their

Territories
 and 
Dominions.


This drew upon them that fatal
war before mentioned, by which they
were sorely weakned and brought


so low, that except God by a more
then ordinarie 
Providence
 had pro∣tected
and appeared for them, they
had certainly bin ruinated and never
able to recover themselves again,
however their pride hereby was much
abated: And as Luxurie and lascivi∣ousnes
are the sad effects of prospe∣ritie,
as wel as Pride, so such vices
in a 
bodie Politick
 and Common∣wealth,
as do corrupt the radical hu∣mors,
by abating the vigour of the
Vital parts, doe insensiblie tend
to the consumption and decay of the
whole.


That this Commonwealth hath
much recovered its strength, may
clearly appeare, if we consider what
great things they have effected, since
the little time they have enjoyed
peace: They have in lesse then 7 yeares
built about 40 gallant ships of war;
They have laid out vast sums of trea∣sure
in refortifying 
Narden, Ma∣stricht,
Breda,
 the 
Grave
 and ma∣ny
other places: They have payd


vast sums of money to their Allies
for their auxiliarie troopes, as also
200000 pound sterling to the King
of England to Enjoy their peace
with him. And besides all this
their Encrease in Riches and power
may be guest at, by the many state∣ly
houses built within these 5 years
in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and
other places; to all which we may
ad, to what excessive hight the 
A∣ctions

of the 
East
 and 
West-Indie

Companie are risen, and the obli∣gations
from the Sates are so estee∣med
as to securitie, that they Can
get as much money as they please
at 2 
Per cent:
 not to speak, of the
Exceeding encrease of their subjects,
occasioned by the 
French Kings
 ty∣rannie
against the distressed 
Prote∣stants

in 
France, Alsace
 and other
parts of his 
Conquests,
 neither wil
we speak of other signes of the
encrease of this 
Commonwealth,
 as
not Judging it convenient to commit
them to paper, but wil now pro∣ceed


to shew the Method of Living
and travelling in the Dominions and
places of the 
States,
 which if you do
wel consider you May see, how hap∣pie
and easie the 
Government
 of 
En∣gland

is, above that of other Na∣tions.


The 
Brill
 in 
Holland
 is the Usual
place where the 
Packet
 and Kings

pleasure boats
 bring on such as come
for to see the United Provinces:
here be sure to furnish your self wel
with money. From hence you take a
boat to 
Maseland Sluce
 or 
Rotter∣dam,

which if you goe in Compa∣nie
with others, wil only cost you
5 stivers: but if you take one for
your self, wil cost 25. stivers for

Maseland Sluce,
 and a 
Ducaton
 to

Rotterdam.
 The Fifth part of which
goes to the 
States
 for a tax, they call

Passagie Gelt:
 and the other 4 parts
are for the boat Men or Shippers,
who also out of their gaines must Pay
a 
tax
 to the 
States,
 so that by com∣putation
you pay a fift pennie to the



States
 for your travelling either in
boats by water, or in waggons by
land.


As you passe by 
Maseland Sluce

you'l see a verie faire fishing village,
to which belong near two hundred

Herring Buisses,
 but if you goe by
the way of 
Rotterdam
 you sail by
two old Townes Called 
Flardin
 and

Schiedam:
 yet let me advise you be∣fore
you depart from the 
Bril,
 to
take a serious view of it, as beeing
the citie which in 
Queen Elisabeths

time was one of the 
Cautionarie
Townes
 pawned to 
England.
 The

Brill
 had a voyce among the 
States,

but by reason 
Rotterdam
 hath got
away their Trade, by which having
lost its former lustre, is now become
afishing town onely.


Rotterdam
 is the second Citie
for trade in 
Holland
 and by some is
caled 
little London,
 as having vast
traffick with 
England,
 in so much
that many of the citisens speak good
English. There are in this citie two


considerable Churches of English
and Scotch: and how great a
trade they drive with the 
King
 of

Englands
 subjects is evident, for
in the yeare 1674 at the opening of
the waters after a great frost, there
departed out of 
Rotterdam
 300 Sail
of Englesh, Scotch and Irish Ships
at once with an Easterly wind: And
if a reason should be demanded how
it coms to passe, that so many En∣glish
Ships should frequently com
to that haven? It is easilie answered,
because they can ordinarily Load
and unload, and make returns to
England from 
Rotterdam,
 before
a Ship can get clear from 
Am∣sterdam

and the 
Texel:
 And ther∣fore
your English Merchants find it
Cheaper and more commodious for
trade, that after their goods are
arrived at 
Rotterdam,
 to send their
goods in boats Landward in, to 
Am∣sterdam.


This citie is famous as beeing the
place where Great 
Erasmus
 was


born, whose Statue of Brasse stands
erected in the Market place; And al∣though
the buldings here are not so
superb as those of 
Amsterdam, Ley∣den

or 
Harlem,
 yet the places worth
the seeing, are, first the 
Great Church

where Several 
Admirals
 Lay State∣ly
Entombed, here you see their

Admiralitie, East Indie,
 and 
Stat∣houses

together with that caled, 
het
Gemeen Lands Huis.


From 
Rotterdam
 you may for 5
strivers have a boat to bring you to
Delph, but before you com thither
you passe thro a faire village called

Overschie,
 where the 
French
 and

English
 youths are trayned up in lit∣terautre,
as to the 
Latin
 and 
Dutch

tongue, 
Booke keeping,
 &c: from
thence in the same boat you com to

Delph
 which is famous for making
of Porceline to that degree, that it
much resembles the China, but
onely it is not transparent.


In Delph is the great 
Magasin
 of

Arms
 for the whole 
Province
 of



Holland:
 Their churches are verie
large, in one of which are 
Tombs
 of
the 
Princes of Orange, Admiral
Tromp
 and General Morgans Ladie,
and in the Cloyster over against the
Church you have an Inscription in a
Pillar of Brasse, shewing after what
manner 
William
 the 1, that famous
Prince of 
Orange
 was Shot to death
by a miscreant 
Jesuist,
 with his de∣served
punishment.


Delph
 hath the 3
d
 voyce in the

States of Holland,
 and sends its
Deputies unto the Colledge of the

States General,
 and to all other col∣ledges
of the 
Commonwealth.
 They
have also a Chamber in the 
East-Indie
Companie,
 as shal be more
largely spoken to, when we shal com
to treat of the State of the said Com∣panie.


From 
Delph
 you may by boat be
brought to the 
Hague
 for 2 Stivers
and an halfe: Which is accounted
the fairest Village in the world, both
for Pompous buildings and the large∣nes


thereof; Here the 
Princes of
Orange
 hold their Residence: as
also the 
States General
 and the 
Coun∣cel
of State,
 Here you have the

Courts of Justice, Chancerie,
 and
other 
Courts of Law.
 Here you
see that 
Great Hall,
 in which ma∣ny
Hundreds of coulers are hung
up in 
Trophie,
 taken from the 
Em∣peror,
Spaniard
 and other 
Poten∣tates

with whom they have waged
war. There 
Councel Chambers
 are
admired by all that see them. Ma∣ny
faire 
Libraries
 they have be∣longing
to particular men. The

Princes Pallace
 is a most superb
building, And there are many cost∣lie
Gardins adjoyning to the 
Hague,

together with that to the 
Princes
house
 in the 
Woad,
 in which house
are in a large Hall the most rare and
costly Pictures of Europe, there also
are those magnificent and unparal∣led
Gardins of the Heer 
Bentham,

of 
Amesland
 and others. I might here
speak of the splendor of the 
Prince



of 
Orange
 his 
Court,
 of his noble
virtues and valour, of the most vir∣tuous
and Beautiful Princesse his roy∣al
consort, but I dare not, least I
should infinitely fal short of what
ought to be, and which others
have alreadie don before me: and
therfore leaving the 
Hague,
 I shal
onely tel you that from thence
you may for 7 Stivers have a boat
to bring you to 
Leyden. Leyden

is a faire and great citie, and the
Universitie is verie famous, beeing
frequented by 1000 of Students from
all parts, as 
Hungarie, Poland,
Germanie,
 yea from the 
Ottomans
Empire
 it self, who pretend to be
grecians, besides the English, Scots
and Irish, who this years were num∣bred
to be above 80.


The most remarkable things here
to be seen, I shal summarilie set
down: As the place called the 
Bergh,

formerly a 
Castle
 belonging to the
Prince of 
Liege
 in 
Flanders:
 The

Stathowse,
 the 
Ʋniversitie
 Schooles,


specially that of the 
Anatomie,

which excels all the 
Anatomie

Schooles in the world, a Book of the
rarities whereof you may have for 6
Stivers, their 
Physick Garden,
 and
the Professors 
Closet
 are al ravishing
in rare Curiosities. But as to their

Colledges,
 they are but two and ve∣rie
small, not to be compared with
the smallest 
Hals
 in 
Oxford,
 nei∣ther
have they any endowments,
their maintenance being onely from
the charitable collections of the

Ministers
 of 
Holland,
 neyther
are any Students to remain longer
there, then til they attain the degree
of 
Batchelers
 of 
Art:
 One of the
Curators beeing demaunded by me,
why so rich a 
Commonwealth
 as

Holland
 is, did not build and en∣dow

Colledges
 after the manner of

Oxford
 and 
Cambridge,
 answered
they had not so many able and pu∣blick
spirited men as are in 
England,

and to deal plainly with you, said
he, had we such 
Colledges,
 our



Burgemasters
 and 
Magistrates

would fil them with their own and
their friends sons, who by leading
a lazie and idle life would never be∣com
capable to serve the Common∣wealth,
and therefore he judged it
much better to put them to Pension
in Burgers howses, leaveing them
to the care of the Professors, who
are verie diligent in keeping the Stu∣dents
at their exercises, both at
Publick lectures and in their private
howses also, where they cause them
Punctually at their appointed houres
to come to their examinations and
lectures, besides those they have in
Publick. Their churches are rare,
so are the walks round the citie, and
the fortifications verie pleasing to
behold. Here you have the 
River
Rhine
 running through the citie and
falling into it from 
Catwyckop Zee.
Leyden
 is verie famous in historie,
for the long Siege it held out against
the 
Spaniard.
 From hence for twelve
stivers and an half you are brought


to 
Harlem
 by water, being twelve
English miles.


Harlem
 is famous in that 
Costor

one of their Burgers, first invented
the 
Art of Printing.
 This 
Costor

beeing suspected to be a Conjurer,
was fain to flee from 
Harlem
 to Co∣logne
in 
Germany,
 and there Perfe∣cted
his Invention, having in 
Har∣lem

onely found out the way of prin∣ting
on one side of the Paper. The
first book he ever printed is kept in
the 
Stathouse,
 for those that are cu∣rious
to see it. Here is one of the
fairest and largest Churches of the 17
Provinces, in the wals whereof there
remain to this day sticking 
canon
Bullets,
 shot by the Spaniards du∣ring
the Siege thereof. In this
Church are three 
Organs,
 as also
the model of the three Ships, that
sayled from 
Harlem
 to. 
Damiater,

seasing the Castle in which the Earl
of 
Holland
 was kept prisoner, and
brought him away to 
Holland:
 In
the 
Tower
 of this Church hang two


silver be
s which they also brought
from thence, and now ring them
everie night at nine a clock.


Harlem
 is renowned for making
the finest linnen cloth, Tyfinies
Dammasks and silk Stufs; also Ri∣bands
and Tapes; They have Mils
by which they can weave fortie and
50 Pieces at a time, they make the
finest white thread and Tapes for
lace in the whole world, there 
Blea∣cheries

surpas al other whatsoever,
their waters whitening cloath better
then any in the seventeen Provinces:
They have a most pleasant grove like
a little 
Wood,
 divided into Walks
where on Sondays and holly dayes
the Citisens of 
Amsterdam
 and other
places come to take their pleasure.

Harlem
 is the second citie of 
Hol∣land

and sends in 
Deputies
 unto all
the 
Colledges
 of the 
Gouvernment.

From hence you have a passage by
boat to 
Amsterdam
 for six stivers,
but when you are come half way you
must step out of one boat to goe in∣to


another, where you see a Stately

Pallace,
 where the Lords, called

Dykgraves
 sit, Everie one of these
Lords hath his 
Apartment
 when he
coms for the concerns of the Sea∣dykes,
and bancks: here are also
2 large 
Sluces
 having gates to let in
or out water from the 
Harlemmer
Meer.
 Near this place about Ano:
1672 a part of the Seabanck was bro∣ken
by a strong Northwest wind,
drowning all the land betwixt 
Am∣sterdam

and 
Harlem,
 which cost an
incredible vast sum to have it repai∣red.
They sunck in this breach 400
smal vessels fild with earth and stones
for a foundation to rebuild the wel
upon, and by unspeakable industrie
and charges at last repaired the Banck.


I come now to speak of 
Amster∣dam,

which having bin the place of
my abode for several years, I shal
give a more large and punctual ac∣count
thereof then I doe of other
places; It is esteemed by Intelligent
men the second citie in the world for


trade, and not inferiour to any in
wealth. Certainly 
Amsterdam
 is one
of the beautifullest cities in the
world, their buildings are large,
their streets for the most part plea∣santly
planted with trees & paved so
neatly, as is to be found no where els
in any other Countrie, save in some
of the 17 Provinces. And although,
as I have alreadie said, 
Amster∣dam

may Justly be taken for the se∣cond
or third citie after 
London
 and

Paris,
 yet it hath neither 
Courtnor
Ʋniversitie,
 as they have. And
now in treating of all the excellen∣cies
and virtues of 
Amsterdam,
 I
shal not hyperbolise, or flatter: for
before I have don you shal see, I
shal also faithfully declaime against
the evils, mistakes and vices in it.


Amsterdam
 stands upon a thou∣sand

Morgans
 of Land, encompassed
with a verie strong wal and 
Bastions

most pleasant to behold, with a ve∣rie
large 
Burgaval
 or 
Gracht
 as they
cal it, for the defence of three parts


of the citie, the fourth being secured
by the sea or 
Ty.
 There are 13
Churches in this citie for those of
the reformed religion (called dutch

Presbiterians)
 to meet and worship
in, with two 
Frencb,
 one 
Highdutch

and one English, all 
Presbiterian

Churches, who onely are alowed

Bels,
 and whose 
Ministers
 are
maintayned by the 
Magistrate.
 All
these Churches or congregations
make up onely a third part of the
Inhabitants of the citie: The 
Papists

who have eightie five howses or
Chappels to meet in for their wor∣ship,
make another third part, and
have a long square of howses for
their Nuns to live in, who are not
shut up in Cloysters, as in Papists
countries they are wont to doe, but
may goe in and out at their pleasure,
yea and marrie also if they grow
wearie of a 
Nunnish
 life: These Chur∣ches
of the Papists have no bels al∣lowed
them, beeing lookt upon as
conventicles, and are many times


shut up, and again opened at the

Scouts
 pleasure. The other third part
of the citie is made up by 
Jewes,
Lutherans, Arminians, Brownists

or English 
Independents,
 Anabap∣tists
and the 
Quakers:
 None of which,
as was also said of the Papists, have
bels allowed them, but are accoun∣ted

Conventicles:
 and all that marie
amongst them, must first be maried
by the 
Magistrate,
 and then if
they pease among themselves in their
own assemblies, neyther are any of
them admitted unto any Office in
the Government, but onely such
as are of the 
reformed
 or 
Presbite∣rian

profession.


The 
Jewes
 who are verie conside∣rable
in the trade of this citie have
two 
Synagogues,
 one whereof is the
Largest in 
Christendom,
 and as some
say in the world, sure I am, it far ex∣ceeds,
those in 
Rome, venice,
 and
all other places where I have bin:
Within the 
Court yard
 where their

Synagogue
 stands, they have severa



Roomes or schooles, where their
children are taught Hebrew, and
verie carefully, to the shame of Chri∣stians
negligence, brought up and
instruckted in the Jewish principles.


Amsterdam
 for the wise 
States∣men

it hath produced, is said to be a
second 
Athens:
 others make it the

Storehowse
 or Magasin of 
Europe,

for that it hath such great store of
Corne, wherewith it furnishes
many other nations. And secondly
for the exceeding great 
Magasin

of Spices, which in antient times
the 
Venetians
 brought by land, fur∣nishing
all parts of 
Europe,
 but now
is don by the 
East-Indie
 Companie
which not onely supplyes 
Europe

therewith, but many places in the
Indies also. Thirdly it hath incon∣ceivable
store of al manner of pro∣visions
for war, In so much that

England
 and divers other nations
send to 
Amsterdam
 to buy 
Arms,
Bufcoats, Belts, Match &c:
 yea
here are several 
Shopkeepers
 who can


deliver 
Armes
 for 4000 or 5000
men, and at a cheaper rate then
can be got any where else, and this
they can doe by reason of their great
Industry in the Ingrossing most of
the Iron workes on the 
Rhine
 and
other Rivers which run into 
Hol∣land.

Forthly 
Amsterdam
 hath more
store of sawed and prepared Tymber
for shipping then can be found in any
one Nation in the world, and this is
the reason why her Neighbour town

Sardam
 is made capable of Building
ships 20 per cent cheaper then they
can doe in 
England
 or 
France:
 So
that both 
France,
 and 
Spaine
 do
many times buy them in 
Holland:
 as
lately the King of 
Spaine
 bought 10
Capital Ships of the two Brothers the

Melts
 Merchants in this citie. Fifthly

Amsterdam
 is the staple where the

Emperor
 sels his 
Quicksilver
 not only
to the 
Spaniard,
 to use in his mines
in the 
Indies,
 but for the making of

Cinoprium
 or 
Vermillion,
 with which

Amstrerdam
 furnisheth not only



Europe,
 but many places in the 
Indies.


Sixtly 
Amsterdam
 is the 
Mar∣ket

where the 
French King
 bought
his Marble for 
Versellis Lou∣vre,

and other of his 
Palaces
 in

France:
 There are such Vast 
Ma∣gasins

in 
Amsterdam
 that a man
would think, that sees them, there
were Quaries of 
Marble
 neare the
City Gates. Seaventhly 
Amster∣dam

hath the most considerable

Bank
 that now is in the whole
World; I have compared the 
Bank

of 
Venice
 with that of 
Genua
 and
both their 
Banks
 write not of so
much money in two dayes as 
Am∣sterdam

doth in one: further I have
compared the 
Bank
 of 
Venice
 with

Hamburg
 and find both those 
Banks

fall very much short with the bank
of 
Amsterdam.
 There are many
other particulars I could name▪
as Arguments to prove the great
Riches & Trade of 
Amsterdam,

as those vast Quantities of Wynes,
& Brandewynes they sell in the



North
 & 
Eastseas,
 & those vast
Countryes adjoyning thereunto,
from whence they bring 
Hemp,
Pitch
 & 
Tar,
 & furnish 
France, Ita∣ly

& 
Spain
 with the same, & they
likewise have much Ingrossed the
Copper & Iron of 
Sweedland.

I will say no more of her stores &
Magazins, but shall in the next
place say some thing of her Church∣es
& Charitie to the Poore. I will
not speake much of her Church∣es,
but only that they are in Ge∣neral
large and well built: In one
of them the 
States
 have Spared no
cost to exceed the whole world in
3 things (Viz) an Organ with
sets of Pipes that counterfit a Corus
of Voyces, it hath 52 whole stops
besides halfe stops, & hath 2 rowes
of Keyes for the feet, and three
rowes of Keyes for the Hands; I have
had people of Quality to heare it
play, who could not believe but
that there were men or Women
above singing in the Organ, un∣till


they were convinced by goeing
up into the Organ Roome. The
second is such a large Carved Pul∣pet
& Canapie as cannot be found
elsewhere in the world; The
third is a Screene of brasse.


The 
Stathouse
 in this Citty is a
wonderfull superb Building, on
the uppermost part of which is a
large 
Magazin
 of 
Armes.
 The 
Cop∣per
Statues
 that stand on top of the

Stathouse
 are very large & peeces
Exellently cast, Especially that cal∣led

Atlas,
 who hath a 
Globe
 of the
world on his back that will hold 30
Barels of water, for me to speake
of the several rarityes of 
Pictures,

Carved works & marble in this Stat∣house,
& of the 
Globes Celestiall
 &

Terrestriall
 that are on the floor of
the 
great Hall,
 would make▪ Booke
of it selfe; I therefore will speake
of their 
Almeshouses
 & of the
Government of the poore, of their
Prisons & houses of Correction.
This Citty is said to have 20000


poore Every day at Bed & board.
The Almeshouses are many & look
more like 
Princes Palaces
 then Lod∣gings
for poore people; First there
are houses for poor 
Ouldmen
 &

Women,
 then a large square 
Palace

for 300 Widdowes, then there
are 
Hospitals
 for Boyes & Girles,
for Burgers Children & for stran∣gers
Children, or those cald 
Found∣tings,

all these boyes & girles have
Every sonday & other dayes of
Worship 2 doites given them by
the Fathers of these Houses, the
which the Children put into the
Deacons sack when they gather
for the Poore in the Churches;
Then there is an 
Hospital
 for fooles,
& a 
Bedlam:
 There are Houses where
Common Beggers & Gamesters &
frequenters of 
Taphcuses
 are Kept
hard at work: There is also a House
called the Rasphouse where petty
Theeues & such as flash one another
with Knives, such as beg with
cheating devises, women with fained


great Bellyes, men pretending to have
been taken by the Turk, others
that pretend wrack at sea, & such as
beg with a Clapper or a Bell, as if
they could not speake or heare,
such as these are kept hard at work,
Rasping Every day 50 pounds be∣tween
2 of them, or Else are beaten
with a Bulls Pissel, & if yet thy re∣bel
& wont work, they are set in a
Tub where if they doe not pump the
water will swell over their heads;
Then there is a House where whores
are Kept to worke, as also diso∣bedient
Children who live Idle &
take no course to maintain them∣selves,
likewise Women commonly
drinking themselves drunck, and
scolds; Al these sorts of 
Hospitals
 &

Almeshouses
 are Stately Buildings
richly adorned with Pictures & their
Lodgings very neat & cleane. In
some of the Boyes & Girles 
Hospi∣tals

there are 1500, in some 800 &
in some 500 in a House; Then they
have Houses where a man or a


Woman may have their Dyet, wash∣ing
& Lodging for his life,
giving a small summe of money:
These are called 
Brouders
 houses,
the Almes Children of this citie are
held in such Veneration & respect
that a man had as good strike a

Burgemasters
 Child as one of them.
These Children are permitted to
travel in any of the 
Treckscuts
 freely
without money; These Hospitals
are Governed by Men & women,
as are of an unspotted life & repu∣ted
to be rich, devout & pious,
it is very observable that the Wo∣men
Governe their Women Hospi∣tals
better then the men do theirs
yea it is a General observation in this
Country, that where the Women
have the direction of the purse &
Trade, the husband seldom prove
Bankrupts, it being the propertie of
a true borne Hollands-wife presently
after marriage to apply her selfe
wholly to her Business; but I for∣bear
to say any more of the Duch


Houswives, for feare of displeasing
our English Dames, not so much
addicted, at least not so Generally
bred up to Industry; but to returne
to the Acts of Charitie of 
Am∣sterdam;

the which is so Extraor∣dinary
that they surpas al other
Cittyes in the World, for they are
dayly & houerly giveing to the
poore, Every House in 
Amster∣dam

hath a Box hanging in a
Chaine on which is written 
Think
on the Poore,
 so that when any
merchant sels Goods they com∣monly
conclude no bargain, but
more or less is put in the 
Poores
Box;
 These Boxes art Lockt up
by the 
Deacons,
 who once a quarter
goe round the Citty & take the
Money out of the Boxes. Then
twice a week there are men belon∣ging
to the Hospitals that goe round
the Citty & ring a bell at every House
to Know what the Master or mi∣stris
of the House will give to the
Box, who Generally give not less


then 2 stivers. Then every first We∣densday
of the moneth the 
Deacons

in their turne goe round the Citty
from House to House to receive
what every house Keeper will give
to the Poore, Then on the week
before the 
Sacrament
 is given, a

Minister
 with an 
Elder
 goes round
the City to every House where any
members of the 
Presbiterian
 Reli∣gion
live, & there ask if any Diffe∣rences
be in the familie, offering
their service to reconcile them, al∣soe
to Instruct & prepare such as
are to receive the 
Sacrament;
 At
this tyme a 
Minister
 may be seen to
goe into a 
Taphouse
 or 
Taverne
 for
which at another tyme he would be
counted a 
wyne biber
 & the worst
of 
Reprobates;
 At this tyme while
these 
Ministers
 & 
Elders
 goe about
the City on their 
Visiations
 the
people take an Occasion to give to
the Poore. And here I ought not
to omit telling you of their great
Charitie to the distressed 
French


Prosestants,
 who are here in great
Numbers. They maintaine no less
then 60 
French Ministers,
 & unto
many handicraft Tradesmen and
makers of stuffs, & Cloath, they
lend sums of Money without In∣trest
to buy Working Tooles &
materials for their work, but this
is no other then they formerly did
to the Poore distressed 
Protestants

of 
Ireland
 & 
Piemont,
 & their
Charitie was not a littel that they
gave to 
Geneve
 towards the buil∣ding
their 
Fortifications;
 And here
give me leave to tell you what 
King
Charles
 the second said of the Cha∣ritie
of 
Amsterdam,
 when the 
Duke
of Lotherdal
 heareing that the

Prince
 of 
Oranges
 Armie was not
able to oppose the french from ad∣vanting
so neare to 
Amsterdam,
 the
Duke Jeareingly said that Oranges
would be very scarse in 
Holland,
 af∣ter

Amsterdam
 should fall into the
french hands to plunder, to which
his 
Majestie
 said that he was of o∣pinion


that God would preserve 
Am∣sterdam

from being destroyed if it
were only for the great charitie they
have for the Poore, the which put
the Duke out of Countenance; I
will say no more of their Charitie,
only this that they leave no stone
unturned to bring moneyes into
the Poores stock, they make the
stage players pay 80000 Gilders a
yeare to the Poore: thert is not a

Ropedancer, puppetplayer
 or any
of that sort of unnecessary 
Vermin

which frequent faires, but pay the
3d penny to the Poore, which is
carefully looked after by placeing an

Almesman
 at the doore of the
Booths, to see that they cheat not
the Poore of their share; I shall
now in the next place say some thing
of the 
Clergie,
 I meane those called
the 
States Clergie,
 for the 
States

are absolutely head of their 
Church,

& when any synod of Divines meet,
two of the 
States,
 are alwayes present
to heare that they debate nothing


relating or Reflecting on the
Government, or Governers, if
they doe, presently the 
States
 cry ho
la mij
 Heeren 
Predicanten
,
 & if
their Ministers meddel with any
thing relating to the Goverment in
their Pulpits they send them a briefe
(which some call a paire of shooes) to
quit the City, & some times Impri∣prison
them to boot: but if they
behave themselves quietely & well,
as they ought to doe, they th
n
are respected by the people as Gods
upon earth; They have a forme of
prayer sent them, how they shall
pray for the 
States
 & 
Prince
 of 
O∣range,

nor must they meddell with
any other Religion in the Country,
because all sorts are Tollerated, at
least connived at by the Magistrates;
All those called the 
Presbeterian

Ministers or 
States
 Clergie are obli∣ged
under a forfiture to have done
preaching & praying by eleven of the
Clock in the forenoone on Son∣dayes,
because then the 
Schepens
 goe


to the 
Stathouse,
 to marry the 
Jewes
Papists
 & 
Lutherans
 & others that
may not mary after the 
Calvinisti∣call

forme, & the reason why the

States
 thus marry them first accor∣ding
to law, is to render their
Children Legitimate, but they may
marry againe afterward as they please
themselves: none may marry un∣till
they have made their appearence
at the 
Stathouse
 before the Lords,
where if the parties be agreed, the
Preachers marry the 
Calvinists,
 &
the 
Schepens
 marry all the rest, who
differ from the Religion established
by Law.


When one dyes the friends dare
not burry the Corps until it hath
lain three dayes open in the Coffen,
that the friends & relations of the
deceased may be satisfied that the
party hath not been murdered or
reported to be dead when alive,
after 3 dayes the corps must be
brought to the church before the
Delceaseth tolling, which is at two


for if you Keepe the body untill
half three then the Church dores are
lockt & for the first halfe houre
must be payd 25 Gilders, & for the
second 50, & so untill six, then they
may amers you as much as they
please.


There are many rich people who
make that default on purpose, that
they may have solemn occasion of
giveing to the Poore, as I Knew
once an English merchant did.


The next thing I shall speake of is
the method which the 
States
 observe
in ordering their Maritim affairs,
one of the greatest mysteryes in
their Goverment; The States Gene∣rally
divide their 
Admiralty
 into five
Courts, which they call 
Chambers:

The first is 
Rotterdam
 (which is the
chamber called the 
Mase)
 which
hath the 
Admirals
 Flagg.


Then 
Amsterdam
 which hath the

Vice-Admirals
 Flagg, & 
Zealand

hath the 
reare Admiral
 Flagg, the
other two Chambers are those in



North Holland
 & 
Friesland:
 Each
of these five Chambers have their 
Ad∣mirals,

Vice 
Admirals
 & reare 
Ad∣mirals

apart from the 
States
 Ge∣nerals
Flaggs, so that when the

States
 have occasion to set out a fleet
of an 100 Shipps more or less, every

Chamber
 Knowes the number they
must provide for their proportion,
tho in regard of its Opulencye 
Am∣sterdam

frequently helps her neigh∣bours
& ads two or more Shipps then
their share comes to; These 
Cham∣bers

have lately built 36 men of
war, & now are building of 7 more
and all this is done without noise,
every one building their proportion,
& they have admirable methods in
preserving their Shipps when Built,
& their Magazins are in good order
every Shipp haveing an 
appartment

to lay up all its 
Equipage
 in, &
on the Top of their 
Magazins

are Vast 
Cisterns,
 which are Kept
constantly full of water which have

pipes
 into every 
appartment
 to let


down water upon any accident of
Fire, & there is in their 
Magazins
 a
Nursery Roome, where a Woman
keeps an Office to feed at certaine
houres of the day a great number
of Cats, which afterward hunt
among the stores for Mice &
Ratts; This great 
Magazine
 in

Amsterdam
 was built in the tyme of

Cromwell
 in the space of 9 moneths
& 14 dayes, in which tyme the 
Lords

of the 
Admiraltie
 gave the work∣men

drinkgelt
 as they call it, to in∣courage
them to work more then at
an ordinary rate. At this tyme the
biggest man of war the States had
was the 
Amelia,
 in which the famous

Amiral Trump
 was Kild, shee
was a Ship of no more then 56
Guns, afterward made a 
fire Ship.

But the 
States
 quickly discovered
their want of great Shipps, and there∣fore
built the same yeare 20 men
of war, from 50 to 80 Gunns. But
the great Shipps built at 
Amster∣dam

had like to have proved of no


use, had not theingenious 
Pensionarie

de 
Wit
 found out a devise to carry
them over the 
Pampus,
 betwixt
those they call Water Shipps;


The 
Admiralty
 have an Exellent
Method in setting out their Fleets,
they neither presse soldiers nor sea∣men,
all goe Voluntarie at the bea∣ting
of à Drumb, each Captain pro∣viding
men & Provisions for his
Shipp, who after they have recei∣ved
orders from the Lords to the

Equipagemaster
 to 
Equipe
 out
their Shipps, & receive the Povi∣sions
of war, then the 
States
 send a
board each Shipp a 
Chaplin,
 &

Check Master,
 who take care of
the provision of war, & see that the
seamen have the 
States
 allowance &
wholesome food, & great care is
taken by the 
Lords
 that both 
Cap∣tains

& 
Seamen
 receive their pay
punctually for the tyme they are in
the 
States
 service, & for the In∣couraging
their seamen there is plai∣stred
on a Board hanging by the


foremast, the several rewards to
such as either take or fire a 
Flagshipp

or take or sinck any other 
Shipp
 of
the enimies, also what pensions a
wounded seaman shal have if maimd
or disabled in the 
States
 service
&c.


The 
Lords
 of the 
Admiralty
 fol∣low
the same methodes which the

States General
 observe, as to their
land obligations, & goe throw this
great charge by the good manage∣ment
of their Credit, for tho it
be true that they are indebted great
summes of money, yet they never
want a supply, nay, Moneyes are
often forced upon them by rich
Merchants, who send in their,
moneys and only take the 
Admyral∣tyes

obligations, with which they
afterward pay their Customes, when
their Shipps arive, at which tyme the

Admiralty
 allowes them Intrest for
the tyme they have had their money,
& this is it that makes the 
Admi∣raltyes

Obligations more valued then


ready money, for it saves the trou∣ble
of telling, & such is the Cre∣dit
of the 
Admiralty
 that when they
have occasion for any Goods, the
people strive to furnish them, &
rather take their Obligations then
money, because they get Intrest;
& all other assignments upon the

Admiralty
 are very punctually payd,
& without Exchequer Fees, no they
are sworne Officers who are for∣bid
to receive any moneyes for fees,
being contented with the sallary,
they have 
of the States.
 And their
Methodes used at the 
Custome House

for loading or unloading Shipps are
very easy, in so much that the Wo∣men
Generally have the chargeing
& dischargeing the Shipps at the

Custome House,
 which is a great po∣litie
in the 
States
 to make Trade
easy for the Incouragement of the
Merchants; And the 
Admiralty
 are
very Gratefull & Generous unto
their Commanders, if any of their

Admiralls,
 or 
Captains
 are Kild at


sea & have dove any Considerable
service, they then Eternise their
memories with lasting 
Trophies
 of ho∣nor,
as you may see by those 
State∣ly
Monuments
 of 
Trump, Ʋpdam,
de Ruiter,
 the 
Eversons,
 & others,
nor are they spareing in bestowing
large Gifts & Pensions on the Wid∣dowes,
& Children of those as have
served them faithfully & Valiantly
in the wars, whilst the Treacherous
& Cowards meet with the severity
they deserve; I might here in the
next place in large & tel you of the
Exellent methodes they have in
building & preserveing their Shipps
when built, but I shall refer you to
that Exellent peece written by the

Heer Witsen
 on that subject. And
shall now in the next place say some
thing of their famous Company
called the 
East-India
 Company of
the 
Netherlands,
 This 
Company

is said to be a 
Commonwealth
 within
a 
Commonwealth,
 & it is true if you
consider the Soveraigne Power &


Priviledges they have granted them
by the 
States
 General, & likewise
consider their riches & Vast Num∣ber
of subjects, & the many Ter∣ritories
& 
Colonies
 they possess in
the 
East-Indies,
 they are said to have
30000 men in constant pay, &
above 200 Capital 
Shipps,
 besides

Sloopes, Catches,
 & 
Yachts.
 This

Company
 hath by their Politick con∣trivances
& sedulons Industry pos∣sessed
themselves of many 
Colonies

formerly belonging unto the

Spaniards,
 & 
Portugeeses,
 & di∣verse

Indian Princes,
 & as good
Christians have been at great Charge
in Planting the 
Gospel
 of 
Christ
 in
many parts there, Printing in the
Indian Language Bibles, & Prayer
Bookes & Catechismes, for the
Instruction of the 
Indians,
 mai∣taineing

Ministers
 & 
Schoolema∣sters

to inform those that are con∣verted
to the 
Christian
 faith; And
now because I have said that this

Company
 is so considerable & as it


were a 
Commonwealth
 apart, I will
demonstrate it to be so, first by
their power, Riches & strength in
the 
Indies,
 secondly what figure
they make in 
Europe,
 & this verie
briefly, for if I should speake of
every particular as to their posessions
in the 
Indies,
 it would swell into
many Volumes, But I will only
begin with them at the 
Cape of de
Bonne Esperance
 where they have
built a Royall Fort, in which they
maintaine a 
Garrison
 of souldiers to
defend their Shipps which come
there to take in fresh Water; from
thence let us take a view of them
in the Iland of 
Java
 where they
have built a faire City called 
Bat∣tavia

& fortified it with 
Bastions

after the Mode of 
Amsterdam.
 This
City is the place of Residence of
their grand 
Minister
 of 
State,
 called
the 
General
 of the 
Indies,
 he hath
allowed him 6 
Privie Councellers
 in
Ordinary & 2 extraordinary, These
governe the concernes of the Com∣pany


throughout the Indies, &
They make peace & war, send
ther Ambassadors to all parts thereof,
as occasion requireth. This 
Gene∣ral

hath his Guards of 
Horse
 &

Foot
 & all sorts of Officers & ser∣vants
as if he were a soveraigne

Prince,
 the whole Expence where∣of
is defraied out of the Companys
stock. This 
General
 hath much
of the Direction of 
Bantam
 and
other parts of the Iland of 
Java:

From whence let us take a view of
them, in their great possessions in
the 
Moluceas
 Ilands & those of

Banda
 where they are become so
formidable that they looke as if
they aimed at the soveraingtye of
the 
Southseas:
 They have also a
great Trade in 
China
 & 
Japan,

from whence let us return to the
Ilands of 
Sumatra
 & on the coast
of 
Bengale,
 where they have several
Lodges; In Persia they have like∣wise
great Commerce & are so con∣siderable
that they wage war with


that mighty 
Monarch
 if he wrongs
them in their trade. They also have
several 
Colonies
 & 
Lodges
 on the coast
of 
Malabar
 & 
Cormandel,
 & in
the Country of the Great 
Magul,

& King of 
Galcanda,
 But princi∣pally
let us behold them in the rich
Iland of 
Zylon
 where they are Ma∣sters
of the plaine Country, so that
the 
Emperor
 or 
King
 of that Iland
is forced to live in the Mountains
whilst this Company possess the
City of Colomba & other the most
considerable Garrisons of that I∣land:
It is said that the Company
hath there in their pav 3600 Soul∣diers,
& at least 300 Gunus plan∣ted
in their 
Forts
 & 
Garrisons.
 In
a word they are not only masters of
the 
Cinamon,
 but of all other 
Spi∣ces

except 
Pepper
 & that they would
also have, had it bin for their In∣trest
to Ingrosse, but they wisely
fore saw that the 
English
 would be a
Block in their way, therefore they
contented themselves to be masters


the 
Mace, Cynamon, Cloves
 and

Nutmegs
 with which they not only
serve 
Europe,
 but many places in
the 
Indies;
 I will say no more of
them in the 
Indies,
 But let us
see what figure they make in 
Europe.

And first to begin with them in 
Am∣sterdam,

where they have two large

Stately Palaces,
 one being in the
ould part of the City, and the other
in the new; In that of the ould part
of the City they keep their Court,
and there sits the Resident Com∣mittie
of the Company, where alsoe
they make the sales of the Company
goods. There for six yeares the grand
Councel or assembly of the 17 doe
meet, and after six yeares are expi∣red,
the grand Councel of the 17
doe assemble at 
Middelburg
 in Zea∣land
for two yeares, and then againe
returne to 
Amsterdam:
 The other
lesser Chambers of 
Delph, Rotter∣dam,
Horne
 and 
Enchusen
 never
haveing the assembly of the 17 in
their Chambers, so that only 
Am∣sterdam



and 
Zealand
 have the 
ho∣nour

of that 
grand Councel.
 I will
therefore crave leave to describe
unto you the 
Chamber
 of 
Amster∣dam,

it being the most Considerable
of the Chambers, belonging to this
famous Company; In there house
or Palace within the ould City are
many large Offices or appartments,
as first on the Lower Floor is their

Parlement
 Chamber, where the 17
doe sit: Next to this Chamber are
several faire Chambers for the Com∣mittes
to sit in. They have also a
Chamber of Audience, where they
do receive 
Princes
 or 
Ambassa∣dors,

or other great men as have oc∣casion
to speak with them. In one
of these Chambers are the Armes
of several 
Indian Princes
 they have
Conquered. On the same Floor is
their 
Tresury Office,
 where their
Receivers sit and receive mo∣ney,
and pay out the orders or
assignments of the Company, Neer

o that Chamber sits their grand


Minister the Heer 
Peter van Dam,

who is said to be a Second 
John de
Wit
 for parts, but he hath not one
drop of 
John de Wits
 or 
Lovestine

bloud, against the good 
Prince
 of

Orange;
 This great minister is a
man of Indefaigable Industry and
labor night and day in the Com∣panyes
service; He reads over
twice the great Journal Bookes which
come from the 
Indies,
 and out of
them makes minets to prepare mat∣ters
of concerne necessary to be
considered by the grand Councel of
the 17, and by the Inferiour 
Com∣mittes

of the Company, and pre∣pares
Instructions and orders to be
sent to their 
Chief Ministers
 in the

Indies,
 I could say many more things
of his great 
worth
 and 
Virtues,
 but
shall forbeare least I should be Judged
a flatterer: Overagainst this great
Ministers 
Office
 sitt in a Chamber
many Clarkes or under Secretaryes,
who receive from this Minister their
Ordrs of dispatches in the affaires of


Company, and next to this Cham∣ber
is a 
Register Office
 where are
kept the Journal bookes of the 
In∣dies,

where you may see the names
of al the men, and women that
have ever served the Company in
the 
Indies,
 with the tyme of their
death, or departing the Compa∣nyes
service; Then next to that is
a Councel Chamber where the Re∣siding
Chamber or Committe of the
Company alwayes sitts Then assen∣ding
up staires, there sitt their Book∣holders,
who keepe the accounts of
all the Transactions of those that
buy or sel actions of the Company,
and over against this office sitts the

Heer Gerbrand Elias
 who is the se∣cond
Advocate of the Company: On
this floore are several large Roomes
in which are great stores of Packt
Goods, and also a Roome with all
sorts of 
Drugs, Tee,
 and 
Wax,
Ambergreace,
 and 
Musk,
 and on
the same floore is a Chamber where
the 
Commissiners
 sitt who governe,


the 
Packhouses;
 And next to them
sitt their Clarks who keepe the Re∣gisters
of the sales of the Company
Goods; And on the same Gallery
or Floore is a Chamber where are
kept the severall Bookes of Divi∣nitie,
printed in the 
Indian
 Language
that are sent to the several 
Co∣lonies

of the Company: And at the
end of this Gallery is a 
Magazine

full of 
Medicaments
 and 
Instru∣ments

for Barber Chirurgions
Chests, to furnish the Companyes

Shipps
 and 
Garrisons
 in the 
Indies.

Then assending up another paire
of staires, there are several large

Magazins
 of 
Nutmegs, Cloves,
Mace
 and 
Sinamond,
 and in a
long Gallery are many men at
work sorting of 
Spices
 fitt for
sale. Then ascending up another
paire of staires there are many
Roomes full of 
Spices,
 then de∣sending
into the Court-yard there
is a 
Guard Chamber
 where every
night the house keeper hath a 
Watch,



and on the other side of the Gate
there is the 
Chymist,
 who with
his men prepares 
Medicaments

for the 
Indies;
 Adjoyning to
this Court-yard is their 
Way∣house

and 
Packhouse
 for 
Pepper
 and
Grosse 
Goods;
 But before I leave
this house in the ould part of the
City, I must say some thing of the
maner or method used in the 
Trans∣actions

of the Jewes and others, who
make a Trade of buyng and selling
the 
Actions
 of the Company, the
which is a great mystery of 
Iniqui∣tie,

and where it inricheth one man,
it ruins an hundred. The 
Jewes
 are
the chiefe in that Trade, and are said
to negotiate 17 parts of 20 in the
Company; These Actions are bought
and should 4 tymes a day, at 8 in
the morning in the Jewes street, at
a 11 on the 
Dam,
 at twelve and at
one a Clock upon the 
Exchange,
 and
at six in the evening on the 
Dam,
 and
in the 
Coledges
 or 
Clubs
 of the 
Jewes

until 12 at midnight, where many


tymes the Crafty Jewes, and others
have Contrived to Coine bad newes
to make the Actions fall, and good
newes to raise them, the which craft
of doing at 
Amsterdam
 is not taken
notice of, which is much to be won∣dered
at, in such a wise Goverment
as 
Amsterdam
 is, for it is a certaine
trueth they many times spread scan∣dalous
reports touching the affaires
of 
State,
 which passe amongst the
Ignorant for truth; I shall now in
the next place say some thing of their

Pallace
 or Magazine in the new part
of the City the which may more pro∣perly
be called an 
Arsenal;
 It is a
building so superb that it lookes
more like a Kings Pallace, then a

Magazin
 for 
Merchants;
 I have
measured the Ground on which this

Arsenal
 stands which I find to be
2000 foot, and square every way,
reckoning the 
Motes,
 or 
Burgals,

about it; I remember the Ingenious
Sr. 
Joseph Williamsen
 measured the
two 
Rope-allies
 by telling the stone


figures in the wal, & found them
to be 1800 foot long, the like
whereof is not to be seene in the
world. On the backside of this 
Rope∣allie

lyes a store of 500 Large 
An∣chors

besides small ones; In this 
Ar∣senal

they build the Ships belonging
to this Chamber: and here are al
sorts of worke houses for the 
Ar∣tificers

that serve the Company.
And in a Chamber next to the
Joyners Office, is a model of a

Ship,
 they now build their 
Ships

by, which cost 6000 Gilders. When
a man beholds the great stores of

Tymber, Cordage,
 and the 
Pro∣visions

of war in their 
Magazin,
 a
man would think there were enough
to furnish a whole 
Nation;
 In
this 
Arsenal
 the 
Ships
 unload their
Goods layd up in several apartments
in the grand 
Magazin,
 and after∣ward
is removed to the house in the
ould part of the City, as their is oc∣casion
for 
sale:
 In the upper part of
this large 
Pallace
 sit the saile Ma∣kers


at worke, but on the Lower part
of this house is an appartment
where the 
Bewinthebbers
 assemble
upon occasion of Businesse; This

Arsenal
 is not to be seen by stran∣gers
without a Ticket from the

Bewinthebbers;
 Now al what I have
spoaken of these two houses, or

Magazins
 doth only belong unto
the Chamber of 
Amsterdam;
 There
are yet other 
Chambers
 of the Com∣pany,
who according to their
Quota, or stock in the Company,
have the like houses and 
Magazins,

as the Chambers of 
Zealand, Delph
Rotterdam, Horne
 and 
Enkusen.
 And
now I have named the six Chambers
of which the Company is compo∣sed,
I shall say some thing of their
constitution, which is from an

Octroy,
 or Act of the 
States Ge∣neral,

by which they have sove∣raign
power over their servants in
the Indies, yea their Authoritie
reacheth their servants in al Terri∣toryes
of the States General Do∣nions;


It is Death for any of the
States subjects to be Interlopers
against this Company, nor may any
of what nation soever that lives in
any of the Companyes Territories
as Burgers or servants, returne into
Europe without leave from the
Company, only those called 
Free∣men

may depart without askeing
leave to remove; The Grand
Councel of this Company is the
Assembly of the 
Seventeen,
 which
are Elected out of the several
Chambers before named, that is,
eight from 
Amsterdam,
 and four
from 
Zealand: Delph, Rotterdam,
Horne
 and 
Enkusen
 send one a peece,
which makes sixteen, and the
five lesser Chambers by turns chose
the seventeenth. In the Chamber of

Amsterdam
 there are 20 
Bewint∣hebbers

in ordinary, who are for
life, and have 1000 Ducatones a
yeare and spices at Christmas, and
their travelling charges, when they
goe upon the Companyes service.


The next Chamber is 
Zealand

which hath twelve 
Bewinthebbers,

who have about 250 L. a yeare and
travelling Charges, and Spices at
Christmas; The next is 
Delph
 which
hath seven 
Bewinthebbers,
 who
have only 120 L. a yeare and Tra∣velling
Charges and Spices at

Christmas:
 The other Chambers of

Rotterdam, Horne
 and 
Enkhusen

have seven 
Bewinthebbers
 a peece,
and the like sallarie, with tra∣velling
Charges and 
Spices
 at

Christmas,
 as the Chamber of 
Delph

hath. These 
Bewinthebbers
 are
Elected or chosen out of those 
Ad∣venterers

called the high 
Partici∣panten

of the Company; They
generally chose such as are rich
and men of parts, and wisdome,
most of them being of the 
Magi∣stratie

of the Country. No man is
capable of being Elected a 
Bewint∣hebber

who hath not a 1000 L. stock
in the Company. In a word this
grand 
Councel
 of the Seventeen


make lawes for the governing the
Company, both in 
India
 and

Europe.
 It is they that appoint the
dayes of 
Sale
 and what number of

Ships
 each Chamber must send to
the 
Indies:
 and likewise order the
building of 
Ships,
 and all other
grand concernes. This 
Company
 is
worthily Esteemed a wise, 
Politique,

deserving 
Company,
 spareing no cost
to get good Intelligence of affaires,
sending 
Messengers
 and 
Expresses

over land to the 
East-Indies:
 They
have their 
Spies
 and 
Correspondents

in all the considerable Trading parts
of the 
world;
 They have been so
industrious as to gaine the 
Spice

Trade, not only from the 
Venetians,
Spaniards, Portugueses, French,
Danes
 and other 
Europian nations,

but have also Ingrossed all the Spi∣ces,
so that, as I tould you before,
they sell spices to the 
Indians
 them∣selves:
but this I must say for them
that they are a Generous 
Company

and gratefully paying respects where


it is due, as lately they have Com∣plemented
his 
Royall highness the
Prince of Orange
 with an Annuall
summe out of the profits of their

Company,
 to make him their,
friend and 
Protector.
 Neyther are
they backward in bestowing pre∣sents
upon strangers that have obli∣ged
them, as I could instance in
some of our own 
Nation:
 They
are also very charitable to the 
Poore

giveing them the 1000th Gilder of
all the goods they sell; And to all the

reformed Ministers
 in 
Amsterdam

they send 
Spices
 at 
Christmas,
 to
pray every Sonday for the welfare
and prosperitye of the 
Company.
 To
conclude this 
Companie
 is a 
Buckler

and defence for the 
Commonwealth

upon all urgent occasions: and truly
our 
English East-India Company

might be the same to our 
King,
 if
the Differences between the two 
Com∣panyes

were composed: Especially
now they have such a great 
King
 to
protect them, and that the 
Interlo∣pers



are distroyed. And now it is
high tyme I should tell you the me∣thodes
a stranger must take if he hath
occasion to Keep house in 
Amster∣dam:

If a man will hyer an house,
he must take a lease upon seald pa∣per,
for which you must pay a 
Tax

to the 
States,
 and pay the 
Broaker

that makes the bargen, but before
you can buy a house you must be
in a capacitie to be made a 
Burger.

To this purpose it is usuall to take
with you to the 
Stathouse
 your

Broaker
 or any two 
Securityes,
 and
there before the 
Burgemasters
 take
the oath of 
Burgerschap,
 which is to
be faithfull to the 
City,
 to the

Magistrates
 and 
Goverment
 &c.
but if you buy either 
Land
 or 
Hou∣ses,

and lodge privately you will
find your case much worse, Then
you must pay a 
Legion
 of 
Taxes
 to
the 
mils
 that draine your 
Lands,

and for maintaining the 
Banks
 and

Sluces,
 and if the 
States
 have oc∣casion


to build a 
Fortification
 on
your 
Lands,
 or to drownd them in
the tyme of 
warre,
 you must be
contented with the 
States
 Termes,
and if your house or houses stand
Empty without Tenents, yet you
must pay the 
States Taxes
 on that
house or houses; Thus much for
the method how you are to be ad∣vanced
to be a 
Burger
 of 
Amster∣dam,

and to give you a tast what you
are to pay for 
houses
 or 
Land,
 if
you settel there, and if you have either
purchased or hyred an house then
comes an 
Officer
 from the 
Stathouse

with a printed seald paper, who tels
you, you must pay as followeth: first a
pole tax for every male and female
servant in the house above 8 yares
old, six Gilders a yeare.


For a Coach if you keepe one
75 Gilders a yeare.


For a Coach without wheeles
50 Gilders a yeare.


For sope as the Number of the
familie is:



The like for salt:


For wyne as your Qualitie is:


To the Rattel watch as your house
is in Greatnes.


To the Lanthornes as the large∣nes
of the house is.


For Butter every 20 pound seven
stivers.


For Beens halfe as much as you
pay for the beens.


For Turff every Tun five stivers.


For every 20 Gilders in wood
six Gilders.


For Flesh the 
Tax
 often changeth:


There is also a 
Tax
 on the Bread.


Then there is a 
Tax
 called the
200ste penny, and a 
Tax
 called the
8th: then there are many Taxes in
Trade, as that no man can weigh
or measure out his owne Goods if
sould in grosse, but the 
States
Officers
 must doe it, Then the

States
 have a 
Tax
 called the 
Ver∣pounding

on all 
Lands
 and 
Houses

in their 
Dominions;
 Then they have
a 
Tax
 on seald paper, and a 
Tax
 for


Registering Lands or houses, like∣wise
a 
Tax
 on 
Cowes, Horses,
Calues,
 and all sort of 
Fruit.
 There
are many other 
Taxes
 I could
name, as a stiver for every man
that goes out or into any 
City
 after
the houer of shutting the Ports,
also you pay for going over
som 
Bridges,
 and passing thro

Gates
 called 
Tolhek,
 a stiver for
every persons, but 
Coaches, Wagons

or 
Horses
 pay more; These I have
already named; you will say, are
to many, yet I may not forget to
tell you, that 
Milke
 first payes as

Milke,
 and again if it be made 
Butter

yea the 
Buttermilke,
 and 
whay
 payes
a 
Tax
 likewise, for all which a man
would think that a 
people
 that stand
so much upon maintaining of their
liberty should 
mutinie
 and refuse
payment. But this seldome happens,
and if it doth the 
States
 punish them
very severely. I remember that in
my tyme there was a mutinie at 
Sar∣dam

about paying a new 
Tax,



whereupon the 
States
 sent a 
Regi∣ment

of their 
Souldiers,
 and sealed
the heads of the 
Mutiniers
 and
hanged up 5 or six of them at the
Townes end, and severely whipt
8 under the 
Gallowes;
 And in the
rich City of 
Amsterdam
 if any re∣fuse
to pay their 
Tax,
 the 
Magi∣strates

send their Officer to pull of
their 
Dores,
 and if they remaine
long obstinate, they send and
fetch away the lower 
Windowes
 of
their house, and they dare not put
up others, until they have payd the
Taxes; Howerer this is observable
that if any man will sweare he is not
worth what he is taxed at, then he
is free: but there are many so proud,
that they will not let the world Know
their Condition, I Knew a Mer∣chant
named Ornia, who payd du∣ring
the war for his 200ste penny
and other Taxes for his and his wives
Children, (haveing had two rich
wives) 14000 pound sterlyng: I also
knew an English Anabaptist Mer∣chant


who tould Mr. Envoye Sid∣ney
in my presence, that he had
payd neare 4000 L. sterlyng to the
war, and yet the same man did Grum∣ble
to pay his Majesties 
Consul
 a pit∣tyfull
fee or Consulat money on
his Ships: the reason whereof I
once asked him, who answered me
that the King could not raise a penny
in England without his Parlement,
and therefore much less, could he
doe it in the 
States
 Country: Thus
these Phanaticks had rather make
bricks without straw, then pay the
least tribut to their Naturall Princes
Officer: should wee in England be
obliged to pay the Taxes that are
here imposed, there would be Re∣bellion,
upon Rebellion: and yet
after all that is here payd no man
may bake his owne bread, or grind
his owne corne, or brew his beere,
nor dare any man keepe in his house
a hand Mil, althought it be but to
grind Mustard or Coffy. I remem∣ber
one Mis Guyn a Coffy woman


at 
Rotterdam
 had like to have been
ruined for grinding hir owne 
Coffy,

had not 
Sir Lyonel Jenkins
 em∣ployed
his Secretary 
Doctor Wyn
 to
intreat the 
States
 on her behalfe,
and it was reckoned a grand favor
that shee was only find, and not
banished the 
City,
 and forfiture
made of all her Goods; I remem∣ber
also a Landlord of mine in Lay∣den
bought a live 
Pig
 in the market
and Innocently brough it home, and
Kild it, for which he had like to
have been ruinated, because he did
not frist send to the accisemen to
accise it, and also let the 
Visitors
 see
that the 
Pig
 was free from 
deseases.

At an other time a wyne Merchant
comeing to give me a Visit, tould
me that he had the rarest Rhinish
in the City, and that if I would
send my maid to his Cellar with six
Bottels they should be fild: where∣upon
I sent the maid only with
two bottels, and charged her to
hide them under her apron, but


such was her misfortune that the
Scouts Dienaers met her and seized
her and her bottels, and caryed
her to Prison, which cost the Wyne
Merchant 1500 Gilders, and had it
not bin for the strongest solicita∣tions
made by us, he had bin ruined:
so sacred are Taxes here and must so
exactly be payd. And were they
not here so precise, it were Im∣possible
for so smal a Country to
subsist: And therefore you may
heare the Inhabitants generally
say, that what they suffer is for
their 
Vaderland,
 hence the meanest
among them are content to pay
what is layd on them, for they say
all what is the 
Vaderlands
 is ours
the men of war are theirs, the sum∣ptuous
Magazins, 
Bridges
 and every
thing what is the 
Vaderlands.
 And
indeed in a sense it is so for they have
this to Comfort them, that if it
please God to Visit them with
Poverty, they and their Children
have the publick purse to maintaine


them, and this is one maine reason
why they so willingly pay their Taxes
as they doe, for theres not a soule
borne in the 
States Dominions
 that
wants warme 
Cloathes
 and 
Dyet;

and good lodging, if they make
their case knowne to the 
Magi∣strates;

and for the 
Vagabonds
 that
rove up and downe the streets, they
are either 
Walons
 or other strangers
as pretend to have bin ruinated by
the late wars. I shall now in the next
place let you know how Exellently
the laws are here executed against

Fraud
 and 
periury,
 and the Intention
of 
Murders,
 which lawes were once
much used in England, as you shall
heare hereafter when I speake of the

Duke of Brandenburgs
 Court. I shall
here Instance a few particullars that
hapened in my tyme: There was a
Spark that made false assignments on
the 
Admiralty,
 who tho related to
many of the 
Magistrates
 of 
Amster∣dam,

had his head cut of; and an∣other
who was a Clark in the 
Mer∣chants


bank,
 who made false posts in
their Bookes, and had his head also
cut of, and all the Portions he had
given with his Daughters, the Hus∣bands
were forced to pay back, and
all his houses and Goods were sould
at his dore in the open streets; I
knew a french 
Marquis
 who swore
his Regiment was Compleat, and
when the 
States
 knew that he had not
halfe his 
Regiment,
 he likewise had
his head cut of in the Prison in the

Hague.
 I also knew a french 
Paeda∣gogue

a 
Runagado
 Monk who
designed to have murdred his master
Major 
Cavellio,
 and his two pu∣pils
young Children of the Majors,
and afterward to set the house a fire
to couler the murder, he had his
head Cut of and set upon a Post with
his body on a 
Wheele
 neare the

Hague;
 I could name you two others
Cheaters, who were severely whipt
under the 
Gallowes:
 and two under

Farmers
 who designed to run
away with the 
States
 money.



The Cheat of breakeing with a
full hand is not so frequent in 
Hol∣land

as in 
England
 (wheresome use
it as a way to Slip out of Business
and then to live conveniently after∣ward
upon the 
Estates
 of other men)
because in 
Holland
 they are more
severely punished when discovered,
then in 
England:
 as on the contraty
those that fall to decay throw 
losses

and unavoidable 
accidents
 which
they could not prevent, find a more
speedy and easie way of Compoun∣ding
and finishing matters with their

Creditours
 if they be over strickt,
then the 
Custome
 or 
law
 of 
En∣gland,

doth aford, for the suing
out of 
Statuts
 of 
Bankrupts
 in

England
 doth prouve many tymes
so pernitious both to 
Creditour
 and

Debtor
 throw the tediousnes of the
proceedings and the expensivenes
of Executing the 
Commissions,
 that
what by 
Commissioners
 fees, 
Treatises

and other incident charges, the

Creditours
 are put to such Expen∣ces


as to be uterly disappointed of
their 
Debt,
 and the Poore 
Debtors

for ever ruinated and undone; I
shall therefore in this place give a
short relation of the method used
in 
Amsterdam
 in the case of 
Ban∣krupts,

which perhaps may be taken
notice of by our King and Parle∣ment
for the preventing disorders
and sad abuses that dayly hapen in
Executing the 
Statutes
 of 
Bankrupts;

The Magistrates of 
Amsterdam

everie yeare name Commissioners
for 
Bankrupts,
 out of those that
make up a 
Judicature,
 like to our
courts of 
Aldermen
 in 
London;

These meet certaine dayes in the
weeke in a distinct Chamber in the

Stathouse
 over whose doore is cut in
marble the Emblem of 
Fortune

flying away with wings, and round

chests
 turnd up side down, with mice
and Ratts eateing the money 
Baggs,
Pens, Inkhornes
 and 
Paperbookes.

There they receive Petitions from

Debtors
 and 
Creditours,
 and as occa∣sion


requireth summon the partyes
to appeare before them, and to lay
open the true State of the matter:
This done they either by authoritie
seaze the 
Bankrupts
 Books and 
Ef∣fects,

or Else without any stir and
noise leave all remaining in the

Debtors
 houses, and send thither
two Committes to examine the
Bookes, and make an inventorie of
the Estate; with power to compose
the matter, without giveing much
trouble to the parties. If the 
Co∣missioners

find that the 
Debtor
 is
come to decay by unexpected losses
and unavoidable accidents, to which
he did not at all contribute, it is
their usuall way to propose to the
Creditour such amicable and easy
termes, as the poore man may be
able to performe, alotting some
tymes the halse of the Estate left to
the 
Debtor,
 some tymes a third
part, and some tymes perswading the

Crediteurs
 to advance to the poore
man a sum of mony to help him up


againe in Trade, upon condition
that he do oblige himselfe to pay the
Creditours all he oweth them, when

God
 shall be pleased to make him
able; but on the Contrary if the

Commissioners
 find that a Trader
hath dealt 
Knavishly
 and broaken
with a designe to defraud and cheat
his 
Creditours,
 as if it appeare that
a 
Bankrupt
 hath kept false bookes,
and counterfitted bills of 
Exchange,

Bills of 
Loading,
 or pretended
Commissions from forraigne parts;
In such a case they are very severe
and not only seaze all the Bookes
and Effects of the 
Bankrupt,
 but also
Imprison him, and also punish
him 
Corporally,
 and if the cheat be
of an haynous nature, sentence him
somtime to death, whereas if the

Debtor
 be only unfortunate and no
wayes knaveish, then the Commis∣saries
use all the Power they have
to force the 
Creditours
 to accept
the Poore mans termes, the which
is better for the 
Creditours
 then to


use the Rigor of the law, in com∣mitting
the Poore man to 
Prison,

seeing in that case the 
Creditours

must maintaine him in 
Prison
 ac∣cording
to his quality, where if he
lyes a certaine tyme, and the 
Cre∣ditours

be not able to prove 


Prisoner
 hath an Estate, then the

Debtor
 is admitted to his oath to
sweare he is not worth 40 Gilders
besides his weareing 
Cloathes,
 and
working 
Tooles,
 and then he is sett
at libertie, but in the mean time
let the 
Prisoner
 have a care not to
make a false Oath, for then he is
punished without mercy, an In∣stance
of which hapened in my tyme.


The 
States
 haveing admitted a
certaine 
Jew
 to come and make
such an Oath before them, were
at the same tyme Informed▪ by the

Goaler
 that this 
Jew
 had been seen
throw the chinks of the 
Doore,
 quil∣ting

Ducats
 of 
Gould
 and some 
Dia∣mons

in his Cloathes, to the Value
of 5000 Gilders The 
States
 here∣upon


admonished the 
Jew
 to take
heed to what he was about to sweare,
because the law was very strickt
against such as made false oathes
before them, and at the same tyme
caused the oath and the Law to be

ead unto him, nevertheless the

Jew
 oftered to take the oath, but
the Lords not suffering him to
sweare, because then he must dye by
Law, caused him to be taken out
into another room and searched,
where they found about him the

Ducats
 and 
Diamonts:
 this being
tould the 
Lords
 they sent for him
in, and then Sentenced him to have
60 lashes under the 
Gallowes
 and
to be banished the 
Country,
 yet
because the 
Jew
 had many Chil∣dren,
they gave a 3d part of what
was taken about him to his wife
and Children, and a third to
the Poore, and the other 3d to the

Creditours,
 which was enough to
pay them their Debt; These 
Com∣missiorers

are payd by the 
States
 and


have not a doit from 
Debtors,
 or

Creditours
 for all what they doe.
These 
Commissioners
 are also much
to be commended for their ready∣nes
to doe good Offices to those
Poore Merchants, Who haveing
lived honestly, are brought to
decay by losles and Crosses in their
Trade: who when they find any such
so Poore that they can neither pay
their 
Creditours,
 nor maintaine
the charge of their 
Families,
 it is
their constant Custome, to take
their Children from them, and
maintaine and bring them up in their

Hospitalls,
 yea often also soliciting
the 
Burgemasters
 on their behalfe
to bestow some smal Office upon
them for their 
Reliefe,
 and 
Sub∣sistance;

And here I must not omitt
to aquaint you, that as the Com∣pounding
of matters in 
Holland

betwixt Debtor and Creditour so
as hath been said, is very easy and
equitable, so is also their way or
method of sueing for 
Debts
 very


favorable, which is after this maner,
In the first place a note or summons
is left at the 
Debtors
 house, and if
he nectlect to appeare, a second sum∣mons
is sent, but then if he neither
appeare himselfe, or send his 
Proctor,

the sheriffs order an arrest against
him, and at last when he it brought
before them, if the matter be dif∣ficult
it is referred to two or three

Goodmen
 of the City, and tyme given
him, but if the plaintiff make Oath
that he apprehends the 
Debtor
 hath
a designe to run away, then must
the 
Prisoner
 either give baile or
return to 
Prison.
 It is a remark
that I have made in my Travells,
that excepting 
France
 and 
Flanders

I never saw in any 
Prison
 above

40 Prisoners
 for debt at one tyme,
and in some great 
Townes
 as in

Harlem
 and other, some tymes not
one; And the reason hereof is
plaine, for you cannot lay a man in

Prison
 for an 
Action
 or debt, small,
or great, but you must maintaine


the 
Prisoner,
 so that many tymes
the charges exceed the principall
Debt, and after all the 
Prisoner

can free himselfe; Whereas the Cu∣stome
in 
England
 encouraged by
those Varlets the 
Pettyfogers
 and
Catchpoles of turning a man into

Prison
 for a 
Crowne,
 or it may be
for nothing at all, if he connot find

Bail,
 he may lye and starve there,
is an abominable abuse, as also that
of suborning false 
Witnesses,
 to
much in use in 
England,
 which is Ex∣tremely
cried out against 
Beyond
sea.
 And now because I am Speakeing
of 
Pettyfogers,
 give me leave to tell
you a story I mett with when I
lived in 
Rome,
 goeing with a Ro∣mane
to see some 
Antiquityes,
 he
shewed me a Chapell dedicated to
one St 
Evona
 a Lawyer of 
Brittanie

who he said came to 
Rome
 to En∣treat
the 
Pope
 to give the 
Lawyers

of 
Brittanie
 a 
Patron,
 to which the
Pope replyed that he knew of no

Saint
 but what was disposed of to


other Professions, at which 
Evona

was very sad and earnestly begd of the

Pope
 to think of one for them:
At the last the 
Pope
 proposed to St

Evona
 that he should goe round the
Church of St. 
John
 de 
Latera
 blind
fould, and after he had said so many
Ave 
Marias,
 that the first 
Saint
 he
layd hold of, should be his 
Patron,

which the good old 
Lawyer
 wil∣lingly
undertook, and at the end
of his Ave Maryes, he stopt at St.

Michels Altar,
 where he layd hold
of the 
Divell,
 under St. Michels
feet, and cryd out, this is our Saint,
let him be our 
Patron,
 so beeing
unblindfolded and seeing what a

Patron
 he had chosen, he went to
his Lodgings so dejected, that in
few moneths after he die'd and co∣ming
to 
heavens Gates
 knockt hard,
whereupon St 
Peoter
 asked who it was
that knockt so bouldly, he replyed,
that he was St. 
Evona
 the 
Advo∣cate,

Away, away said St. 
Peter

here is but one 
Advocate
 in 
heaven,



here is no roome for you 
Lawyers,

O but said St. 
Evona,
 I am that
honest lawyer who never tooke fees
on both sides, or ever pleaded in
a bad Cause, nor did I ever set my
Naibours together by the Eares, or
lived by the sins of the people; well
then said St. 
Peter,
 come in; This
newes comeing downe to 
Rome
 a
witty Poet writ upon St. 
Evonas

Tomb these words: St. 
Evona
 us

Briton, Advocat non Larron, Ha∣leluiah.

This Story put me in mind
of Ben: 
Johnson
 goeing throw a
Church in 
Surry,
 seeing Poore
people weeping over a 
Grave,
 asked
one of the women why they wept,
Oh said shee, we have lost our pre∣tious

Lawyer,
 Justice 
Randall,
 he
kept us all in peace, and always
was so good as to keep us from
goeing to law, the best man ever
lived, well said 
Ben Johnson
 I will
send you an 
Epitaph
 to write upon
his 
Tomb,
 which was,



God works wonders now and
than,


Here lyes a Lawyer an honest∣man.


And trully 
old Ben:
 was in the
right, for in my tyme I have obser∣ved
some Gentlemen of that pro∣fession
that have not Acted like
St. 
Evona,
 or Justice 
Randal,
 I wil
say no more of them, but wish
them as great fees, and as much en∣couragement
as the 
Lawyers
 have
in 
Switserland.


I now come to speake some thing
of the three Taxes I mentioned in the
former part of my remarques on

Taxes,
 of which the first ought
rather to be called an usefull and
publique invention, like to that of
the Insurance Office in 
London,

then a publick Tax, seeing no man
needs contribute to it unless they
please, and find his profit by it,
but the other may be called Taxes
because the subjects are obliged to


submit to them, but then they are
so easy, that what the Publick
gets thereby not only lessons Ex∣traordinary
subsidies, which many
tymes occasions clamour, when be∣cause
of their raritie and the ur∣gencie
of occasions, they must needs
be great.


Yet it is sufficently compensated
by the advantage and securitie in
the Estates which private persons,
who are obliged to pay it, reape
thereby dayly; I am confident that
if the King and Parlement thought
fit to introduce some or all three
of these taxes into 
England,
 the
publick charge of Goverment might
be defrayed with more ease and
with less repining and clamour, then
when it must be done by new and
high Impositions, how ever our
Governers are the proper Judges of
that.


The first then is an 
House
 called
the merchants Bank which is gover∣ned
by diverse Commissioners,


Clarks and Booke keepers, like∣wise
a 
Essaymaster
 who Judgeth of
the Gould and Silver, that at any
tyme is brought into the Bank un∣coyned,
the security given for pre∣servation
thereof, are the 
States
 and
Magistrates of 
Amsterdam.
 Now
if you have a mind to put money
into the Bank, suppose a 1000 L. less
or more, you must goe to the Clarks
and ask a folio for your name, and
then pay in your money at three or
foure per cent according as the rate
of the Bank money is high or low,
or you may buy it of those called

Cashiers
 or Broakers: then get the
Clarks to set downe in the folio what
you bring in, haveing done so you
may draw this summe, or sell it in
what parcels you please, but then if
you let your money lye seven yeares
in the Bank, you receive no Intrest
for the same. If you aske where then
is the advantage for the Merchants?
I answer first you have your money
ready at all tymes for answering


bills of Exchange, and making other
payments: you are at no charge
for baggs or portage, at no loss
by false tale or bad money, in no
danger of Thieves or unfaithfull
servants, or fire, and above all you
have the accounts of your cash most
punctually and Justly kept without
any trouble or runing the risk of
Gouldsmith or Cashieres breaking
in your Debt; for such is their care
that twice a yeare, or some tymes
oftner they shut up the Bank for 14
dayes, and then all that have con∣cerns
therein must bring in their
accounts to the Clarkes, who a few
dayes after, haveing viewed the
Bookes, aquaint such as have brought
in wrong accounts with their mis∣takes,
desiring them to returne to
their bookes, and rectifie their Er∣ror,
not telling them wherein the
mistake lyes, so that I have knowne
Merchants, in my tyme sent back
three or foure tymes, with their
wrong accounts: but if they begin


to grow Impatient and say that they
will stand to their accounts, then
they pay a mulct to the Clarkes upon
their Covincing them of their mis∣takes,
either by chargeing to much
upon the Bank, or forgetting or
omitting what was their due. I
knew two Merchants, who haveing
forgott the one 750 L. and the other
220 L. in their accounts, were
honestly rectified by the Clarkes,
so that they susstained no loss; be∣sides
this care of the Clarkes in
keeping and Stating the accounts,
the bank is obliged for five L. a
yeare to send to every Merchant,
that desires it, their accounts every
morning before Exchange tyme,
of the moneyes written of by them
in the Bank the day before upon
any Merchants account, and what
summes are written of by others
upon their accounts: so that the
Merchants may compare the Banks
notes with their bookes and so save
much of the charges of Booke kee-


Now if it be objected that though
this be an advantage to the Mer∣chants,
yet what can the Publick
gaine thereby, seeing the Charges
of paying Officers, Clarks &c. must
needs be very considerable? I an∣swer,
that indeed it is a mystery
to those who understand not the
thing, but if it were once known
and practised, the advantage of it
would appeare; For among other
things which might be said, The Ma∣gistrates
of the Citty take out of
the Merchants Bank a Sufficent stock
of money to supply the 
Lumbert,
 a
Banck that Lends out money, and is
Governed by 4 Commissioners cho∣sen
out of the Magistrates, who sitt
in Court every day in the 
Lumbert,

which is a large pile of Building 300
foot long, containing several Cham∣bers
and magazines under one Roof,
in these several Chambers the Com∣missioners
have Officers sitting tolend
money upon all sorts of Goods even
from a paires of shooes to the ri∣chest


Jewell &c. This is a great con∣venicence
for Poore people, yea
for Merchants also, who some tymes
may want money to pay a bill of Ex∣change,
and prevents the Cheatting
and Extraordinary Extortion used by
the Pawne brokers in 
England, France

and other Countryes. And besides
the Poore have their 
Pawns
 safely
and well preserved, neither are they
punctually sould when the yeare is
out or denied under the pretext of
being mislaid, as the Poore are of∣ten
tymes served by the wicked

Pawn broakers.
 There is also
another convenience in this 
Lumbert

viz, an Exellent way they have of
discovering 
Thieves,
 and the
stollen goods; They publish two
generall open sales of the Goods
pawnd twice a yeare, that such as
will, may redeeme their goods
and paying the Intrest may have them
although the time be relapsed. Thus
much as to the 
Lumbert.
 I was
once according to my duty to waite


upon our present King at the Bank
of Merchants, where shewing his
Majestie the way of keeping the

Journall Book
 of the Bank which
is of a prodigious bigness, his
Majestie was Extreamly pleased with
the Contrivance of preserveing it
from fire; saying that the course they
tooke might be of great use for
the preserving 
Patents
 and the 
deeds

of Noblemens Estates; This con∣trivance
which perhaps may be
thought usefull or imitable, I shall
therefore discribe it, It is a large
firestone shaped like a Chest, and
set upright in a stone wall having a
large brass doore of a Vast thicknes
with flops to fall over and Cover the
Lock and Hinges, into this chest the
Booke is drawn upon Rouls, it being
of such a Bulk and waight as cannot
be handed in by a man, and there
it is so securely preserved that al∣though
the house should be burnt,
the Booke in al probabilitie would
be safe; Should I here give an


account of the Vast summes of
money that dayly are written of in
this Bank, I might probably be
thought to speake at Random, but
this I may bouldly affirme that it
farr Exceeds all the Bankes in Eu∣rope,
both for Riches and Business,
and their Credit is such that the

Italians, French, Germans
 and 
En∣glish

have great summes in the same,
neither was ever any man refused
his money in the worst of times.


A second Tax is what ariseth
from the just and laudable Esta∣blishment
of a Register, A Tax
which I think most men will be
willing to submit to, Except such
as designe to cheat and defraud their
Naibours, and live by such like sins
and Confusion, and for the most part
die with the curse of the people;
This Register in 
Holland
 begitts
such assurance and Safetie in deal∣ling,
that in purchasing of houses
or land, a Childe tho overreached
in the Value yet cannot be cheated


as to the title: The methodes of
which Register. I have by me for
the use of our King and Parlement
when they please to Command it.


The third and last Tax is that of
sealed paper as it is practised in 
Hol∣land.

The Method of which I
likewise keep by me for his Maiestie
and Parlements Commands. There
are many other things might be spo∣ken,
as to the 
Government
 of 
Am∣sterdam,

but I may not tyre your
patience. However one considera∣ble
thing I would not passe by
touching the 
Melitia;
 There
are in 
Amsterdam
 60 Com∣panyes
of 
Foot,
 the least of them
haveing 200 men, some 300, which
in a modest account, amounts, at
least to 15000 men, in which number
neither 
Jews
 nor 
Anabaptists
 who
carry no 
Armes
 are reckned,
only they are obliged to Con∣tribute
to the maintenance of the

1400 Souldiers
 who are kept in Con∣stant
pay, as a 
Guard
 for the 
Citty,



and towards the night 
watch
 or 
Ra∣telwatch,

who walke the streets the
whole night to keepe good 
Orders,

and tell us every halfe houre what
a Clock it is. There are also upon
every Church Tower, 
Trumpetters

who sound every halfe houre, and
if any fire breakes out in the 
Citty

they give a 
Signall
 on which side of
the 
Citty
 the fire is, and ring the

Firebell,
 and they have Exellent
wayes on a suddain in such sad acci∣dents
to Quench 
Fire:
 but I may not
inlarge any longer, but hasten out
of 
Holland.
 And yet before I leave

Amsterdam
 I must vindicate her
from a malitious aspersion cast upon
her by the Ignorant, they accuse
her to have very rudely and un∣civilly
affronted the Duke of 
York

beeing there. 
Anno
 1681 All which
is very false, True the 
English
Phanaticks
 of 
Amsterdam
 were so
malitiously wicked as to spread se∣verall
lyes of his 
Sacred
 Person,
and stird up the 
Canalie
 as much


as they could to affront his 
High∣nes,

but as for the 
Magistrates
 they
payd him verie great respects; first
sending me to the 
Hague
 to know
what day his 
Highnes
 would please
to honor their 
Citty
 with his pre∣sence,
that thereby they might be
prepared to receive his 
Royall
 per∣son
with all the honor emaginable,
being resolved to Treat his 
Highnes

in their 
Stathouse,
 and that the

Burgers
 should be in their 
Armes,

also giveing out orders for 
Coaches

and the 
Admiraltys Yagts
 to attend
his 
Highnes,
 when ever he pleased to
come, but his 
Highnes,
 by 
Collonel
werden
 let me know that I should
attend the 
Burgemasters,
 and thank
them for their kind presentation,
but his 
Highnes
 was resolved to see
their 
Citty incognito
 and therefore
desired the 
Burgemasters
 not to put
themselves to any maner of Trou∣ble;
Notwithstanding the 
Magi∣strates

Commanded their 
Yatchts

to lye ready the halfeway 
Harlem,



and Vice 
Admiral de Ruiter, Dirick
Tulp,
 and others went out in their
Coaches to meet his 
Highnes,
 and
conduct him into the 
Citty,
 at which
tyme our English 
Phanaticks
 Espe∣cially
those called 
Monmouths

twelve 
Apostels
 did all that they
could to stir up the rude mul∣titude
to affront his 
Highnes,
 crying
out to them, This is he that brought
the last war upon you, and with his

Jesuits
 would cut all the 
Protestants

Throats; But the next day after his

Highnes
 was com into the 
Citty
Burgemaster Valkenier
 the great

Solon
 of 
Amsterdam,
 sent for me
and could me that although the

Burgemasters
 which are the 
Sove∣raignes

of the 
City
 give no Visits
to strange 
Princes,
 unless they

be Crouned
 heads, yet said he I have
a great Ambition to pay a Visit to
the Duke of 
York,
 upon severall
respects, first as being the brother
of so great a 
King,
 and as he is our

Statholders Ʋnckell
 and Father in


law, and therefore said he you shall
procure me 
Audience
 in the priva∣test
maner imaginable: for I designe
to goe with you to him without
so much as a footman attending me;
here upon I waitted upon the Earle
of 
Peterborow
 and 
Collonel Werden

and 
Collonel Porter
 to desire them to
aquaint his 
Highnes
 with the 
Bur∣gemasters

designe, whereupon his

Highnes
 turnd to me, and said

Mr. Carr
 when the 
Burgemaster

pleaseth, whereupon I went im∣mediately
to the 
Burgemaster
 and
attended him to his 
Highnes
 quar∣ters,
the newes whereof comeing
to the 
Cittizens,
 they gathered
together in great 
Multitudes
 to see
whether this great man their 
Petty
God
 did humble himself so far, as
to pay a Visit to his 
Highnes,
 where∣as
the other 
Burgemasters
 only
sent a 
Secretary
 and one of there

Pensionaries
 to Visit the Duke of

Monmouth,
 and all 
Ambassandors
 have
no other Complement but by 
Se∣cretaries



or 
Pensionaries;
 After the

Burgemaster
 had had a long houres

Audience
 with the Duke in a Roome
a part, I attended the 
Burgemaster

to his Daughter 
Pelicorns
 house,
the which was neare his 
Highnes

Lodgings, for the Tumult of the
Burgers was so great, that the 
Bur∣gemaster

did not care to pas by
them, and being come into his
daughters 
Parler,
 he began to
speake to me after this maner,
Sir, I never in all my life met with
a 
Prince
 so generally Experienced
in all things, a 
Prince
 that hath
far penetrated into the affaires of
Europe, and hath the right measures
of the present State of our Coun∣try,
and discourses as if he sate in
our Councell, but above all I was
mightly pleased to heare him declare
himselfe so freely touching Liberty
of Conscience commending the
wisdome of our 
State
 in Opening
their 
Gates
 to all tender Conscien∣ces,
and that is it, said his 
Highnes,



that makes you so considerable and
enticeth the Rich Merchants of
other places to come & live amongst
you, whereas the folly of the 
Spanish
Inquisition
 hunts away the chiefest of
their 
Traders
 the 
Jewes
 and others;
For my part said his 
Highnes,
 I
never was for oppressing tender Con∣sciences
in 
England:
 for nothing
more disturbs the peace and quiet
thereof then forceing men by 
Pe
d
Lawes
 to become all of one 
Religio
,

To conclude, said the 
Burgemaster

do but, Remark this one thing
and remember it, if you out live
me, viz, that if ever this great 
Prince

come to be King of 
England
 he
will alter all the Measures of 
Europe,

and possible become the Arbiter
thereof: After which discourse the

Burgemaster
 said let me now pre∣sent
you, 
mijn Heer Consul.
 with
a Glasse of 
Rhenith wyne
 to his

Highnes
 health, and pray when you
have an Opportunitie to speake with
his 
Highnes,
 assure him that he 



in 
Amsterdam
 a true and faithfull
freind, and moreover he said,
when I speake next with our 
Stat∣holder

the 
Prince of Orange,
 and
our Pensionarie 
Fagel,
 I will doe
his 
Highnes
 Justice; and thus wee
parted: but the civil deportment of
this 
Burgamaster
 was not all, for other
great ones of the Citty did their part
also, as 
Vice-Admiral de Ruiter,

with at least 30 Captains of the 
Ad∣miralty

Chamber of 
Amsterdam

attended his 
Highnes
 to shew him
the Men of warr and 
Magazins

of the 
Admiralty:
 likewise Sir 
Dirick
Tulp
 and the Heer 
Peter van Dan

and others the 
Bewinthebbers
 of the

East-India Company
 attended his

Highnes
 to the 
East-Indie House,

where was spread a 
Banquet
 of

Sweetmeats,
 and rich 
Wines,
 and
they offered his 
Highnes
 a present,
but his highnes would not accept of
any, only two large Bookes in
which were Painted all the 
Beasts,
Fishes,
 and 
Foules,
 and likewise


all the 
Plants, Flowers,
 and 
Fruites

of the 
East-Indies,
 and because
his 
Highnes
 had tasted the Mum
in the 
East-Indie Magazine,
 and
liked it, the 
Company
 caused
twelve 
Caskes,
 to be neatly hoopt,
and gave me them to be sent after
his 
Highnes
 to 
Brussels;
 And I know
it was the resolution of the 
Bewint∣hebbers

to have spared no cost if
his 
Highnes
 would have accepted
of a Treat in their house, by all
which you see that the 
Magistrates

and chiefe men in 
Amsterdam
 were
not guilty of Rudenes to his

Highnes,
 but it was the Canalie.
And now haveing said so much good
of the 
States
 Government, and of

Amsterdam
 in particular, it will not
be amisse to take notice of some Bad
customes and practises now in vogue
in 
Holland,
 and leave it to the reader
to Judge what they may portend;
There are tollerated in the Citty
of 
Amsterdam,
 amongst other abu∣ses,
at least 50 Musick houses, where


lewd Persons of both sexs meet and
practise their villanies. There is also
a place called the 
Longseller
 a Tol∣lerated
Exchange or publick meeting
house for whores and Rogues to
Rendevous in, and make their
filthy Bargains: This Exchange is
open from six a clock afterdinner
untill nine at night; Every whore
must pay three stivers at the dore
for her entrance or admission; I
confess the Ministers preach and
exclaim from the pulpit against this
horrible abuse, but who they be
that Protect them I know not, yet I
have heard some plead for the tol∣leration
of these wicked meetings
upon pretext, that when the

East-India
 fleets come home, the
Seamen are so mad for women, that
if they had not such houses to bait
in, they would force the verie Cit∣tyzens
wives and Daughters: but it is
well known that as money does coun∣tenance,
so Discipline might sup∣press
that abuse. The ould severe


and frugall way of Liveing is now
allmost quite out of Date in Hol∣land,
there is very littell to be seene
of that sober modestie in Apparell,
Diet, and habitations as formerly:
In stead of Convenient Dwellings
the 
Hollandtrs
 now build Stately
palaces, have their delightfull Gar∣dens,
and houses of pleasure, keep
Coaches, waggons and sleas, have
very rich furniture for their horses
with Trappings-adorned with silver
Bells, I have seen the Vanitie of a

Vintners
 sonne, who had the bos∣ses
of the bit and Trapping of his
horse of pure silver, his footman
and Coachman having silver fringd
Gloves; yea so much is the humour
of the women altered and of their
Children also that no Apparel can
now serve them but the best and
richest, that 
France
 and other Coun∣tryes
affoards, and their sonns are so
much adicted to play, that many fa∣milies
in 
Amsterdam
 are ruined by it
not that 
England
 is lesse Extra∣vagant


then the 
Duch,
 who as I said
before got such great Estates by their
frugalitie, whilest they were not
addicted to such prodigalitie and
wantonesse as the English are, whose
excesse I can not excuse, neverthe∣lesse
the grave and sober people of

Holland
 are very sensible of the
great alteration that now is in their
Country, and as they say 
Paracelsus

used to cure his patients of their dis∣ease
with a full belly, so a good

Burgemaster
 desirous to convince
his 
Amsterdammers
 of their dissolute
kind of lif
 invited the Thirty six

Magistrates
 and their wives to a
feast: who being come and the La∣dyes
big with Expectation of some
rare and Extraordinary Entertain∣ment,
sat down at table; where the
first course was Buttermilk boild
with Appells, Stockfish, Buttered
Turnips and Carrots, lettice Salade
and red Herrings, & only smale beare
without any Wyne; At this the
Ladies startled and began to whisper


to their husbands, that they Ex∣pected
no such Entertainement,
but upon removing of the Dishes
and plates they found underneath
printed verses Importing that after
that manner of liveing they began
to thrive, & had inlarged their Citty.


The second course consisted of
Bocke de kooks, quarters of Lamb,
rosted Rabits and a sort of pudding
they cal a 
Brother
 here they had Dorts
and English beare with 
French
 wyne
yet all this did not please the dainty
Dames: but upon removing away
the plates another Dish of poetrie
appeared, which acquainted them
that after that modest and sober way
of Liveing, they might keep what
they had gott, and lay up some thing
for their Children.


Then comes in the third course
made up of all the rarities of the
season, as Patridges, Pheseants and
all sorts of foule and English pa∣sties,
with plenty of Rinish and other
sorts of wyne, to moisten them,


this put the ladyes in a frolick and
Jolly humour, but under their plates
was found the use and Application
in verses, telling them that to feed
after that manner was Voluptuous
and Luxurious, and would Impaire
their health and wast their Estates,
make them neglect their Trade, and
so in Tyme reduce their Stately and
new built flourishing Citty to their
ould fishing towne againe. After
this was brought in a Banquet of all
sorts of sweet meats piled up in pi∣ramides
and delicate fruite with plen∣ty
of delitious wynes, and to con∣clude
all a set of Musick and mas∣kers
who danced with the young
Ladyes; but at parting like the hand
writing to 
Belteshazzar
 upon the
wall, every one had a printed paper
of moralities put into their hand
shewing them the causes of the ruine
of the Roman Commonwealth,
according to that of the Poët.




Nullum crimen abest, facinusque
libidinis ex quo,


Paupertas Roman a perit.


with an Excellent aduice to them that
if they did not quit the Buffoneries
and apish modes of the French, and
returne to the Simplicitie, plaine∣ness
and modestie of their Ancestors
and founders, their Common∣wealth
could not long last; but all
the thanks the good ould 
Burge∣master

had for his kind and Charg∣able
Entertainment in thus feasting
his Countrymen, was to be sloutted
at, and pasquild, The sparkes of

Amsterdam
 saying in all places,
that the ould man being now past
the yeares of pleasure himselfe,
would have none others to take
theirs; And here I shall put a pe∣riod
to what I thought fitt to ob∣serve
of the 
States
 of the 
Ʋnited
Provinces
 only I will beg leave, to say
something to the Hollander by way of
advise viz, That now they are in a


prosperous condition, Rich and at
ease, They would looke back and re∣member
what God in his Infinite
goodnes & mercy did for them in the
dayes of their greatest calamities;
for my owne part I cannot but ad∣mire
the great providence of God
in preserveing them from being
devoured by their many Enimies
they had in the last warr, besides
their enimies at home, some of
which particulars as they then hap∣pened,
give me leave to relate. At
the tyme when the French came to
Inuade the Territoryes of the 
States
General,
 it then looked as if God had
markd out the way for the French
to March, by sending such a won∣derfull
drye season that the Rivers
of the 
Rhine, Beta, Wall,
 and
other Rivers were fordable, so that
the French only waded throw, and
became so Victorious, that in a
little space of tyme (what by the
Treasons of some, and the Igno∣rance,
and cowardise of others In∣trusted


with the Militia, and Garri∣sons)
the French became Masters
of above 40 Cittyes and Garrisons,
at which tyme there was nothing to
be heard of in the States Domi∣nions
but confusion and miserie,
even in the strong and rich Citty of

Amsterdam
 it self, who at this tyme
beheld the French Armie like a
mighty Torrent comeing within
sight of the Citty, and at the same
tyme wanting water in their Ca∣nalls,
and Burgwalls to ply their
Sluces, and such was the scarcity of
Raine that a payle of fresh water was
worth 6 pence; Thus heaven see∣med
to frowne on them as well as the
French Armie, by the shutting up
as it were the Conduits of Heaven,
and yet a worse thing had like to
have fallen out, for at the same tyme
the Divisions grew so high amongst
the Magistrates in the Stathouse,
that it was putting to the Question
wheather or no they should not
goe and meet the French King with


the Keyes of their Citty, to save
it from fire, and Plunder, now
nothing in all probabilitie could
save this rich Citty from falling
into the hands of the French, but
an immediate hand from Heaven,
and it had undoubtedly come to
passe, had not providence caused
the French to make a stand at

Muyden,
 two howers from 
Am∣sterdam,

at what time the Valiant
Roman of 
Amsterdam
 Scout 
Has∣selaer

like a true father of his
Country opposed the French party
in the Councell, calling out to the
Burgers from the Stathouse to take
Courage and rather choose to dye
like old Battavians with their swords
in their hands, then tamely and
Treacherously to yeald up their Cit∣ty
to the mercy of the French, as
some of the Magestrates were about
to doe, this so Incouraged the Bur∣gers
that with great Courage they
mand' the walls, and heaven then
assisting them with a suden and plenty


full raine, that they plyd their sluces,
and drouned the Lands round the
Citty 3 and 4 foot high, in some
places, which caused the Victorious
French Armie to make a quick re∣treat,
as farr as Utrick, else the Mon∣sieur
had payd deare for seeing of

Amsterdam;
 Thus was 
Amster∣dam

delivered by the hand of
Heaven.


A second was, when that Bloody
Duke of 
Luxenburg,
 who gloryed
and thanked God that he was borne
without pitty or remors of Consci∣ence,
took the opportunitye of an
exceeding hard frost to march his
Armie over the Ice as it had been
drye ground, burning in his way the
three faire Villages of 
Bodygrave,
Swammerdam
 and 
Goudse-sluys.

Acting there a more cruell Tradigie
and worse then ever did Turk, for
they Generally save the Country
people for Ransom, but this cruell
Prince caused strong Guards to sur∣round
the villages, and burnd men,


Women and Children together,
Thus he began his march with a de∣signe
to burne 
Leyden, Hague,
Rotterdam, Delph
 and all the rich
Country of 
Rhineland:
 and this he
might have done in all probabilitie,
for first the Governor of Newsluce
who commanded the post that should
have stopt the French, Treacher∣ously
delivered up the fort without
firing a Gunn, and the handfull of
Troopes then under General 
Ko∣ningsmark

were so Inconsiderable
that they joyned to the Souldiers un∣der

Pain
 and 
Vin
 the Governer of
new 
Sluce
 were not Able to make
head as could oppose 
Luxenburgs

Armie, and at the same tyme the
good 
Prince
 of 
Orange
 was with
the States Armie at Charle le Roy.
Now was 
Leyden
 ready to meet the
French with the Keyes of their Cit∣ty,
and other Cittyes too, for they
had neither fortifications nor Soul∣diers
to man their walls; Thus the
whole Country and Cittyes of 
Rhine∣land



were like to fall under the
Crueltyes and Tyranny of the
French, but God a second tyme
sent these people reliefe from
Heaven, first by giveing such un∣danted
Courage to that great States
man 
Pensionarie Fagel
 that he
forced 
Koningsmark
 to Rally his
Troopes together and to make a
Stand neare 
Leyden,
 offering him∣selfe
to dye at the head of them if
there were occasion, but God re∣served
him for a furder good to the
Commonwealth by sending such a
sudden Thaw as was never seen be∣fore,
for in less then ten howers the
Ice so sunk and such Floods of snow
came downe from the high lands
that the French were fain to make
a very disorderly retreat, Marching
up to the middel for hast, because
on the Banks there could not march
above four men a brest, so they
were constrained to leave behind
them the greatest part of the Plun∣der
they had robed from the Inno∣cent


Country people, and the nim∣ble
Duch men on their Sca
ses so
long as the Ice would beare them,
did shoot downe the French like
Ducks diving under water, so
that it cost 
Luxenburgs
 Armie
deare, tho they had the pleasure
to burne the poore people, of which
the French afterward wickedly made
their boast.


The third was as wonderfull as
the two others, and although I doe
not believe miracles, as doe the
Papists, yet I say nothing I ever
observed looked more like a Mi∣racle
then this, to wit, when the
English and French Fleet lay before

Scheveling
 with a designe to land,
and the French ready on their March
to joyne with the English and other
French as soon as they should land, at
the same tyme the 
Bisshop
 of 
Munster

lyeing before 
Groeningen,
 and the
French before 
Gorcom,
 so that
now all things looked with a dread∣full
face for the States, yet at this


very tyme God sent a 3d reliefe by
sending such Mists, and wonderfull
sorts of Tydes, as so separated the
two Fleets, that the English were
forced to quit 
Scheveling
 shore,
and were driven on the side of the

Texel
 Roade; from whence they
were constrained by the season of the
yeare to retire home, and such were
the sudden & great showers of raine
that the Bisshop of Munster was for∣ced
in disorder to raise his siege at

Groeningen,
 and the French to quit

Gorcom;
 I could ad many more ob∣servations
of the Providences of
God to these people, as the pre∣serveing
the 
Prince
 of 
Orange
 from
the many treacherous designes con∣trived
against him from his Cradel,
but Moses must be preserved, to goe
in and out before his people, cer∣tainely
never young 
Prince
 Indured
so many fatigues as did his Highnes
in his tender yeares, of which I was
an eye witnes, and had his Highnes
had the yeares and Experience, and


such a good disciplinde Armie (as now
he hath) in the yeare 1671 when
the French Entered the Country,
his Highnes had given them as good
a welcome as he did at Bergen.
I will say no more of this sub∣ject
only this, that the peace at

Nimwegen
 was also a very wonder∣ful
thing, for that not above 8
dayes before the peace was signed,
most of the 
Plenipotentiaries
 did be∣lieve
the war would have continued
another yeare; first because the
King of 
Denmark
 and Duke of

Brandenburg
 prospered Exceedingly
against 
Sweedland,
 and totally re∣fused
the propositions of France,
and secondly because the French
King writ such Bitter letters against
the 
States Generall:
 yet 8 dayes af∣ter
drest a letter unto the 
States
 in
which he calles them his good
friends, and old Allyes, offering
them not only 
Mastricht
 but every
foot of ground they could lay claime
to in the world, also giveing them


new Termes, and Conditions as to
their priviledges in France, by way
of Trade; Neither can I forget how
speedilie and as strangly the mighty
French King did quit his Conquered
Townes after the Valiant 
Prince
 of

Orange
 took 
Naerden,
 which was
the first step to the Frenchs ruine in
the States Dominions. I come now,
according to promess in the begin∣ning
of this book, to give the
reader some Remarkes I made in
other Countries where I have been
during my sixteen years travels. To
give a full account of all that might
be observed in so many Countries,
is not a taske for one man, nor a sub∣ject
for so small a book; I shall
onely therefore briefely take notice
of some remarkable matters which
may in some measure satisfie the
curiositie of my Country men who
have not been in the said places,
and convince, if possible, all of
them, that no Countrey that ever
I was in, afords so great convenien∣cies


for the generalitie of people to
live in, as the Kingdome of 
England

doth. Though I have twice made
the 
grand tour
 of 
Germany, Hun∣gary,
Italy
 and 
France,
 and after
my return back to 
England
 travel∣led
a third time through 
Holland

as for as 
Strasbourg,
 and so back by

Francfort
 to 
Denmark
 and 
Swe∣den;

yet the reader is not to ex∣pect
I should follow a Geographicall
method and order in speaking of the
places I have been in; that is to be
lookt for in the map, and not in tra∣vels;
but onely that I mention pla∣ces
as I found them on my rode ac∣cording
as busines or curiositie led
mee to travel.


The first considerable place I
then met with, after I was out of
the dominions of the 
States Gene∣ral

was 
Cleave
 the capital citie of
the Province so called, a fair
and lovely citie standing upon the

Rhine
 and the rivers 
Wall
 and 
Le
k.

This Province much resembles 
Eng∣land



in rich soyl and pleasantness of
its rivers. The inhabitants of the
Countrey would have mee beleeve
that they were originally descended
of those 
Saxons
 who made a descent
in to 
England,
 and conquered it; and
to convince the truth of this, they
shew'd mee a cloyster standing on
a hill, called 
Eltham,
 from which
they say our 
Eltham
 in Kent had
its name. I was made to observe
also two places standing upon the

Rhine
 neare 
Emmerick
 called 
Doad∣ford,

and 
Gron
wich,
 which accor∣ding
to them, gave the names to

Dedford
 and 
Greenwich
 in 
England;

but many such analogies and simi∣litudes
of names are to be found in
other places of Germany, but espe∣cially
in uper 
Saxony
 and 
Denmark.

The greatest part of this Province
of 
Cleave,
 and part of the duchy's
of 
Julieres
 and 
Berg,
 and of the
Provinces of 
Marke
 and 
Ravens∣bourg

belongs to the Elector of

Brandenbourg,
 the rest belonging


to the Duke of 
Newbourg
 now Ele∣ctor

Palatine,
 and the Elector of

Cologne.
 The inhabitants are partly
Roman Catholicks, partly Luthe∣rans,
and partly Calvinists, who
all live promiscuously and peaceably
together both in city and Countrey.
The citie of Cleave is the out most
limit of the territories of the Ele∣ctor
of 
Brandenbourg
 on this side of
Germany; from whence his Electo∣rall
Highness can travel two hun∣dred
dutch miles out right in his
own Dominions, and never sleep
out of his own Countrey but one
night in the territories of the Bishop
of 
Osnabrug.


From 
Cleave
 I went to a small
town called 
Rhinberg,
 but a
very strong fortification belonging
to the Elector of 
Cologne;
 which
dies at two miles distance from the
citie of 
Wesel
 that belongs to the
Elector of 
Brandenbourg.
 Through

Disseldorpe:
 scituated on the Rhine,
and the Residence of the duke of



Newbourg,
 I went next to

Cologne
 a very large city, called by
the Romans 
Colonia Agrippina,

and the French 
Rome d'Allema∣gne.


Cologne
 is an Imperial citie and
a Republick, though for some things
it does Homage to the Elector of
that name, and receives an oath
from him. It is much decayed with∣in
these hundred years, having
been much priest ridden, a misfortune
that hath undone many other great
cities. The Jesuits have had so
great influence upon the Magistrats,
that they prevailed with them to
banish all Protestants, who remo∣ved
to 
Hambourg
 and 
Amsterdam,

so that 
Cologne
 is become so dispeo∣pled,
that the houses dayly fall to
ruine for want of inhabitants, and
a great deal of corn and wine now
grows within the walls, upon ground
where houses formerly stood. I dare
be bold to affirm that there is twice
the number of inhabitants in the


parish of St. 
Martins
 in the fields,
then there is in 
Cologne;
 and yet it
contains as many parish churches,
monasteries and chappels, as there
are days in the year. The streets
are very large, and so are the houses
also, in many of which one may
drive a Coach or waggon into the
first room from the streets; but the
streets are so thin of people, that
one may pass some of them and
not meet ten men or women, unless
it be Church men or Religious sisters.
The most considerable inhabitants
of the citie are Protestant Mer∣chants,
tho but few in number,
and they not allowed a Church
neither, but a place called 
Woullin

a mile without the citie: the rest of
the inhabitants who are lay men are
miserably poor. There are no less
than 3000 Students in 
Cologne

taught by the Jesuits 
gratis,
 who
have the priviledge to beg in musi∣call
notes in the day time, and take
to them selves the liberty of bor∣rowing


hats and cloaks in the night:
but if in the Jesuits Schools there
be any rich Burgemasters sons who
have parts, they are sure to be snapt
up and adopted into the societie.
Formerly, before the matter was
otherwise adjusted in the diet of

Ratisbonne,
 there have been designs
of voteing Protestant Magistrats into
the government again; but so soon
as the Jesuits come to discover who
of the Magistrats were for that, they
immediately preferred their sons or
daughters, and made them chanons,
abbots or chanonesses, and so diver∣ted
them by interest. It's pity to
see a city so famous for traffike in
former times now brought to so
great a decay, that were it not for
the trade of Rhenish wine it would
be utterly forsaken, and left wholy
to the Church men. The conti∣nuall
alarms the Magistrats have had
by forreign designs upon their li∣berty,
and the jealousies fo∣mented
among themselfs, as it is


thought, by the Agents and fa∣vourers
of France, and especially the
Bishop of 
Strasbourg,
 have for
severall yeares kept them in conti∣nuall
disquiet, and necessitated them
to raise great taxes which hath not a
litle contributed to the impoverishing
of the people especially the boars
round about; who tho the Coun∣trey
they live in be one of the most
pleasant and fertile plains of Ger∣many,
yet are so wretchedly poor
that canvas cloaths, wooden shoes,
and straw to sleep on in the same
room with their beasts, is the grea∣test
worldly happiness that most of
them can attain unto. The Elector of

Cologne
 is a venerable old man, Bi∣shop
of four great bishopricks, viz

Cologne, Liege,
 Munster, and 
Hel∣dershime.

He divides his time
betwixt his devotion and experimen∣tal
studies, being punctuall in saying
of mass every morning, and con∣stant
in his Elaboratory in the af∣ternoon;
for he is much addicted


to chymistry, and leaves the ad∣ministration
of Government to his
Cozen the Bishop of 
Strasbourg.
 To
speak of all the miracles of the three
Kings of 
Cologne,
 and the vast
number of saints who were remo∣ved
out of England and interred
there, would be but tedious and
perhaps incredible to the reader,
aswell as wide of my designe. I shall
therefore proceed.


From 
Cologne
 I took water on
the Rhine and advanced to the citie
of 
Bon
 and so forward to 
Coblints

the residence of the Elector of 
Trier.

over against this city, on the other
side of the Rhine stands that im∣pregnable
fort called 
Herminshine,

built on a high rocky hill as high
again as 
Windforcastle,
 and on the
north side of it the River Mosel
falls into the Rhine, over which
there is a Stately stone bridge. This
Prince governs his subjects as the
other Spirituall Electors doe, that
is, both by temporall and spirituall


authority, which in that Country is
pretty absolute. The chiefe trade
of this Countrey is in wine, corn,
wood and Iron.


The next Countrey I came to
was that of the Elector of 
Mayence

who is likewise both a secular and
Ecclesiasticall Prince and governs
his subjects accordingly. He is
reckoned to be wholely for the In∣terests
of the French King; who
notwithstanding of that, pretends
a title to the citadel of 
Mayence.

As I was upon my Journey to

Mayence
 by land, I made a turn
down the Rhin to visit the famous
litle city of 
Backrack,
 and some
towns belonging to the Landgrave
of Hessen, but especially 
Backrack,

because Travellers say it much re∣sembles

Jerusalem
 in its scituation
and manner of buildings. The
Burgemaster of this city told mee
that the whole Country about

Backrack
 does not yield above 200
fouders of wine a year; And yet


the Merchants of 
Dort
 by an art
of multiplication which they have
used some years, furnish 
England

with severall thousande of fouders.
Here I shall take the liberty to re∣late
a strange story which I found
recorded in this Countrey; tho I
know it to be mentioned in History.
There was a certain cruel and inhu∣mane.
Bisshop of 
Mayence,
 who in
a year of great scarcity and famine
when a great number of Poor people
came to his gates begging for bread,
caused the Poor wretches, men, wo∣men
and children to be put into
a barn▪ under pretext of relieving
their necessities; but so soon as
they were got in, caused the barn
doors to be shut, fire set to it, and
so burnt them all alive: And whil'st
the poor wretches cried and shree∣ked
out for horrour and pain, the
Barbarous miscreant said to those
that were about him, harke how
the Rats and mice doe crie. But
the just Judgement of God suffe∣red


not the fact to pass unpunished;
for not long after the cruel Bishop
was so haunted with Rats and mice,
that all the guards he kept about
him, could not secure him from
them, neither at table nor in
bed, At length he resolved to flee
for safetie into a tower that stood in
the middle of the Rhine; but the Rats
pursued him, got into his chamber
and devoured him alive; so that the
Justice of the Almighty made him
a prey to vermine who had inhu∣manely
reckoned his fellow Chri∣stians
to be such. The tower which
I saw, to this day is called the
Rats-tower, and the story is upon
record in the city of 
Mayence.


On my Journey from thence I
came to the litle village of 
Hockom

not far distant, famous for our
Hockomore wine, of which though
the place does not produce above
150 fouders a year; yet the Inge∣nions
Hollanders of 
Dort
 make
some thousand fouders of it goe


of, in England and the Indies.


From 
Hockom
 I proceeded to

Francfort
 a pleasant city upon the
river of Maine, called formerl
y

Teutoburgum
 and 
Helenopolis
 and
since 
Francfort,
 becaus here the

Franconians
 who came out of the
Province of 
Franconia
 foarded over,
when they went upon their expe∣dition
into 
Gallia,
 which they con∣quered
and named it 
France:
 and I
thought it might very well deserve
the name of 
Petty-London,
 because
of its Priviledges, and the humour
of the citizens. It is a Hansiatick
and Imperiall town and Common∣wealth,
the Magistrats being Luthe∣rans
which is the publick established
Religion; though the Cathedrall
church belongs to the Roman
Catholicks who also have severall
monasteries there. The citie is
populous and frequented by all
sorts of Merchants, from most parts
of Europe, & part of Asia also, becaus
of the two great faires that are yearely


kept there, Many Jews live in this
city, and the richest Merchants are
Calvinists, who are not suffered to
have a Church in the town, but
half an houres journey out of it, at
a place called 
Bucknam,
 where I have
told seventy four Coaches at a time
all belonging to Merchants of the
city. It was in ancient times much
enriched by 
Charle le maigne
 and
hath been since by the constitution
of the 
Golden bull:
 amongst other
honours & Priviledges its appointed
to be the place of the Emperours
Election, where many of the orna∣ments
belonging to that August
ceremonie are to be seen. It is strongly
fortified having a stately stone bridge
over the Maine that joynes it to 
Saxe∣housen

the quarter of the great master
of the Toutonick order. The
government is easy to the people,
they not being taxed as other cities
are, and had it not been for the
Alarmes the French gave them du∣ring
the last war, they had not been


much troubled, but being forced to
keep three or four thousand men in
constant pay to defend their fortifi∣cations,
the Magistrats were constrai∣ned
to raise money by a tax. Be∣sides
that of the Emperour, they are
under the protection of some neigh∣bouring
Princes, as of the Land∣grave
of Hessen-
Cassells,
 Landgrave
of 
Armestadt,
 the Count of 
Solmes

and the count of 
Hanau,
 who are
either Lutherans or Calvinists,
amongst whom the Late Elector-
Palatine

was also one; but whether
the present who is Roman Catholick
be so or not, I cannot tel. This
city takes great care of their poor,
and in their charitie to poor travel∣lers
exceed Holland. I have seen a
list of seaven thousand whom they
relieved in one year. Their great
hospitall is a large court or palace,
where the English Merchants for∣merly
lived, in the time of Queen

mary's
 persecution of the Protestants,
who when they were recalled by


Queen 
Elisabeth
 were so generous
as to give the whole court, with
all their Packhouses and lands to the
poor of the city. It was my fortune
to be there in that cold Winter in
the year 1683. and saw a ceremonie
performed by the Wine coopers of
the citie, who are obliged by law, that
when ever the Maine lyes fast frozen
over for eight days together, to
make a great Fouder fat, Hoops
and Staves; and set it up compleat
upon the Ice. It was very good diver∣sion
to see so many hands at worke,
and to observe the jollity and mirth
of the many thousands of spectators
who wanted not plenty of Rhenish
wine to carouse in.


I had the curiositie afterward to
goe to the court of the Landgrave
of 
Armestadt
 a Lutheran Prince who
lives in part of the richest soyle in
Germany. His Highness is a very
courteous and obligeing Prince to
Strangers, and his subjects are in
a pretty good condition again,


though they have been great suf∣ferers
by the last war between the
Landgrave of 
Hessen
 and this fa∣milie.


From thence I went to 
Heidleberg

a city I had been formerly in, in the
life time of that wise tho unfortunate
Prince Elector elder brother to Prince
Rupert. Here I had the Honour
to pay-my dutifull respects to the
Elector the son of that great Prince,
whose commissary I had the honour
to be for two years together in 
Am∣sterdam.

This Prince, since my being
there, is lately dead, and left behind
him the reputation of having been
a Zealous thorough paced Calvinist,
and so constant a frequenter of the
church, that some Sundays he went
thrice a day to Sermon; but never
failed, if in health, to be once a
day at least at the garrison-church;
where he took particular notice of
such officers as were absent. He was
married to a most virtuous lady the
Royall sister of the King of Denmark


and his brother Prince George.
During his life time the university
of Heidleberg flourished exceedingly,
so that the number of students was
so great that Chambers and lodgings
in the citie were scarce, and 
Span∣hemius

was about quitting 
Leyden

to return to his professors place in

Heidleberg,
 but how matters stand
since his death, I am as yet ignorant.
This Countrey is called the paradise
of 
Germany
 for its fruitfulness in
wine, corn, and all sorts of fruit.
I my self have seen growing in one
plain at the same time, vines, corn,
chestnuts, almonds, dates, figs,
cherries, besides severall other sorts
of fruit. And as the Countrey is
fertile in yeelding the fruits of the
Earth, so the people are carefull
in providing store room for them.
This I take notice of because of the
prodigious Rhenish wine fats which
are to be seen there, amongst which
there are seaven, the least whereof
holds the quantitie of 250 barells


of Beere as I calculated; but the
large and most celebrated fat is that
which goes by the name of the great
Tun of 
Heidleberg,
 and holds 204
fouders of wine, and cost 705 L.
Sterling in buildiug, for which one
may have a very good house built.
This fat I have seen twice, and
the first time was, when the Elector
treated the French Ambassadours
that came to conclude the match
betwixt his daughter and 
Monsieur

the French Kings brother, who
married her after the death of our
Kings sister his first wife: at which
treat there happened an adventure
that I shall here please the Reader
with. In a gallery that is over this
fat the Elector caused a table to be
placed in the midle, exactly above
the bunghole of this Monstrous ves∣sell,
and to be covered with a costly
banquet of all sorts of sweet meats:
The day before, all the wine being
emptied out of this Tun into other
Fats, a litle before the Ambassa∣dours


with other forrein Ministers
and Persons of qualitie mounted the
stairs to come to the place of enter∣tainment;
The Elector caused twelve
drummers with as many Trumpeters,
some Kettledrums and other musick
to be lodged in the belly of the Tun,
with orders to strike up upon a signall
given, when the Elector drank the
French Kings health. All being
sate down at table and merrily fee∣ding,
the Elector drank the health,
and the signall was given; whereupon
the musick began to play its part
with such a roaring and uncouth
noise out of that vast cavitie below,
that the French and other Persons
of qualitie who were unacquainted
with the designe, looking upon it to
be an infernall and ominous sound,
in great astonishment began to cry
out 
Jesu Marie. The worlds at
an end,
 and to shift every one for
himself in so great disorder and con∣fusion,
that for haste to be gone
they tumbled down staires one over


another. All that the Elector could
say to compose them, was either not
heard or not valued, nor could any
thing satisfie and reassure them, till
they saw the Actors com marching
out of their den. Had not many
Persons of qualitie and travellers seen
this Fat as wel as my self who know
that what I say of its incredible
bigness to be true, I should be
afraid the Reader might think I im∣posed
upon his credulitie.


From 
Heidleberg
 I went to see
that impregnable Fort or citadell
of 
Manheim alias Fredericks-berg

built by the Elector Frederick
brother to Prince Rupert, a Prince
of as good a head as any Germany
affoarded, who though some have
too partially Judged of him by his
misfortunes, yet by the wisest of
the age was acconnted the Cato of
Germany. The wisest and best-men
of the world have been unfortunate,
which makes some to be of the
opinion that God in his wisdom


thinks fit it should be so, least
otherwise they might attribute their
prosperitie rather to the wise dire∣ction
of their own conduct, then
his all seeing Providence: and in∣deed,
dayly experience seemes to
evince the truth of this, since wee
see knaves and fools advanced to
preferment and richess, when men
of virtue and parts die neglected and
poor in the eyes of the world, though
rich in the enioyment of a contented
mind. But this is a digression which
the honour I have for the memory
of that great man hath led mee into,
and therefore I hope will be pardo∣ned
by the Reader. In the citadel
of 
Manheim
 I saw some of the Re∣cords
of that illustrious familie, which
without dispute is the most ancient
of all the Secular Electors, being
elder to that of 
Bavaria
 which
sprung from one and the same stock,
to wit, two Emperours of Ger∣many.
Many writers derive them
originally from 
Charle le maigne,
 by


the line of 
Pepin
 King of France.
There have been severall Emperours
of that race, one King of 
Denmark

and four Kings of 
Sweden,
 one of
which was King of 
Norway
 also,
besides many great Generals of Ar∣mies
in 
Germany, Hungary, France

and other Countries. Since I can
remember there vere five Protestant
Princes heires to that Electorall di∣gnity
alive; which now by their death
is fallen to the Duke of 
Nowbourg
 a
Roman Catholick, whose Daughter
is Empress of Germany and another
of his Daughters maryed to the King
of Portugall. Being so neare Stras∣bourg,
I had the curiositie to goe see
what figure that famous citie now
made since it had changed its ma∣ster;
for I had been thrice there
before, when it flourished under the
Emperours protection, with the li∣berty
of a Hausiatick town: And
Indeed I found it so disfigured, that
had it not been for the stately Ca∣thedrall
Church, and fair streets and


buildings, I could scarcely have
know'n it. In the streets and
Exchange which formerly were
thronged with sober rich and peace∣able
Merchants, you meet with
none hardly now but men in buff
Coats and scarffs with rabbles of
Soldiers their attendants. The
churches I confess are gayer, but not
so much frequented by the inhabi∣tants
as heretofore, seing the Lu∣therans
are thrust into the meanest
churches and most of the chiefe
Merchants both Lutherans and
Calvinists removed to 
Holland
 and

Hambourg.
 Within a few years, I
beleeve it will be just such another
city for trade and Richess as 
Brisac

is. It was formerly a rich city and
well stockt with Merchants and
wealthy inhabitants, who lived under
a gentle and easy government; but
now the Magistrats have litle else
to doe in the government, but
onely to take their rules and mea∣sures
from a citadell and great guns,


which are Edicts that Merchants
least understand. I confess Stras∣bourg
is the less to be pityed that
it so tamely became a slave, and put
on its chains without any strugling.
Those Magistrats who were instru∣ments
in it, are now sensible of their
own folly, and bite their nails for
anger, finding themselves no better
but rather worse hated than the
other Magistrats, who did what
they could to hinder the reception
of their new masters the 
French.
 I
quickly grew weary of being here,
meeting with nothing but com∣plaints
of poverty, and paying
exorbitant taxes; I therefore soon
returned to my 
Petty-London
Francfort,
 and from thence went to

Cassells,
 the chiefe residence of the
Landgrave of 
Hessen.
 This Prince
is a Calvinist, as most of his subjects
are, very grave and Zealous in his
religion: He married a Princess
of 
Courland,
 by whom he hath an
hopefull issue, to wit, three sons


and two Daughters. The late King
was God father to one of his sons,
who was Christened by the name
of 
Charles.
 Captain 
William Legg

Brother to the Lord 
Dartmouth

representing his Majestie as his
Envoy. The court of this Prince
does indeed resemble a well gover∣ned
colledge, or Religious Cloyster,
in regard of its modestie and regu∣laritie
in all things, and especially
in the houres of devotion. He is
rich in money, and entertains about
nine thousand men in constant pay,
under the command of 
Count van
derlipp,
 a brave and expert Soldier
his Lieutenant Generall; but can
bring many more upon occasion
into field. This familie hath been
very happy both in its progenie and
alliances, many wise Princes of both
sexes having sprung from it; and
the mother of this present Landgrave
may be reckoned amongst the illu∣strious
women of the present and
past ages. After the death of Wil∣liam


the 5. Landgrave of Hessen her
husband, she not only supported
but advanced the war wherein he
was engaged, did many signall
actions, Enlarged her territories,
and at the conclusion of the peace
kept under her pay 56 Cornets of
horse in five Regiments, 166 Com∣panies
of foot, besides thirteen
Companies of Dragons, and 14
independent Companies, in all 249
Companies of horse and foot; she
was a Princess extreamly obliging to
strangers: especially virtuous and
learned divines. I had the honour
a good many yeares agoe to kisse her
highnesses hand; at which time she
was mighty Zealous in promoting
an accommodation amongst diffe∣rent
Religions, as the Roman Ca∣tholick,
Lutheran and Calvinist,
but especially betwixt the two lat∣ter,
and therefore entertained 
Do∣ctor
Duris
 at her court in 
Cassels

who wrote severall pieces upon that
subject of reconciliation, and with


some of his friends had a conference
with a learned priest that came from
Rome to forward the project; where∣upon
the Doctor published his
book of the 
Harmoney of Con∣sent,

which is highly esteemed in
Germany.


From this Princes court I dire∣cted
my journey to 
Hanover,
 taking

Lambspring
 in my way, a place where
there is a convent of English Monks;
and there I met with a very aged
worthy and harmeless Gentleman
St. 
Thomas Gascoigue,
 a Person of
more integrity and pietie then to be
guilty, so much as in thought, of
what miscreants falsly swore against
him in the licentions time of plot∣ting;
the Lord Abbot and severall
of the Monks I had seen there for∣merly.
This monastery is very
obliging to all strangers that travell
that way, as well as to theire own
Countreymen, and is highly respe∣cted
by the neighbouring Princes
of all persuasions, as the Princes


of the house of Lunenburg, the
Landgrave of Hessen, and Elector
of 
Cologne,
 who as Bishop of 
Hil∣dersheim

is their ordinary. The
town of Lambspring is Lutheran
though under the government of
the Lord Abbot and his chapter, who
constantly choose Lutheran Magi∣strats
and Officers for the civill ad∣ministration,
and live together in
that love and unitie, that as yet
there hath never the least debate
happened amongst them; and indeed
this harmoney is now to be obser∣ved
in most parts of Germany where
different Religions are professed.
When I considered so many goodly
faces both of Monks and students
in that Abbey, I could not forbeare
to make a serious reflexion on the
number of the English whom I had
seen in the colledges and Cloysters
abroad, as at 
Rome, Rattesbonne,
Wirtzburg
 in 
Lorraine,
 at 
Liege,
Louvain, Brussels, Dunkerk,
Ghent, Paris,
 and other places,


besides the severall Nunneries, and
withall on the loss that both King
and Kingdome suffered thereby,
when so many of our natives both
men and women should be constrai∣ned
to spend their own Estats and
the benevolence of others in a strange
Land, which amounts to more mo∣ney
than at first one may imagine;
and this thought, I confess, made
me wish it were otherwise. I would
not have the Reader to mistake mee
here, as if I espoused, or pleaded
for any particular party; No, I
plead onely for the sentiments of
humanity, without which our nature
degenerates into that of brutes, and
for the love that every honest man
ought to have for his Countrey.
I am asmuch a friend to the Spanish
Inquisition, as to the persecuting
of tender Conscienced protestants,
provided there be no more but
Conscience in the case; and I could
heartily wish that Papists and Pro∣testants
could live as lovingly to∣gether


in 
England
 as they doe in

Holland, Germany,
 and other Coun∣tries;
for give mee leave to say it, I
love not that Religion which in stead
of exulting, destroys the Principles
of morality and humane societie. I
have met with honest men of all per∣suasions,
even Turks and Jews,
who in their lives and manners have
far exceeded many of our Enthu∣siastick
professors at home; and when
ever this happened, I could not
forbeare to love the men with∣out
embraceing there Religion,
for which they themselves are to
account to their great master and
Judge.


In my progress towards 
Hanover

I touched at 
Hildersheim
 a city
whose Magistrates are Lutheran,
though Roman Catholicks have
the Cathedrall Church, and severall
monasteries there. The court of 
Ha∣nover

makes another kind of figure
than that of 
Cassels,
 it being the
court of a greater Prince, who is


Bishop of 
Osnaburg,
 duke of 
Bruns∣wick
Lunenburg, Hanover
 &c.
Here I had the honour to kiss the
hands of the Princess Royall 
Sophia

youngest sister to the late Prince
Rupert. Her highness has the
character of the 
Merry debonnaire
Princess
 of Germany, a lady of ex∣traordinary
virtue and accomplish∣ments,
and mistriss of the Italian,
French, High and low dutch and
English languages, which she speaks
to perfection. Her husband has
the title of the Gentlemen of 
Ger∣many,

a gracefull and comely Prince
both a foot and on horseback, civill
to strongers beyond compare, infi∣nitely
Kind and beneficent to people
in distress, and known in the world
for a valiant and experienced Soldier.
I had the honour to see his troops
which without controversic are as
good men, and commanded by as
expert Officers as any are in Europe:
Amongst his Officers I found brave

Steel-hand Gordon
 Collonel of an


Excellent Regiment of horse,

Grimes, Hamilton, Talbot
 and others
of our Kings subjects. God hath
blest the Prince with a numerous
offspring, having six sons all galant
Princes; of whom the two eldest
signalized themselves so bravely at the
raising of the siege of 
Vienna,
 that
as an undoubted proofe of their
valour they brought three Turks
home to this court prisoners. His
Eldest son is married to a most
beautifull Princess sole heiress of the
duke of 
Lunenbourg
 and 
Zell
 his
elder brother; as the lovely Prin∣cess
his daughter is lately married
to the Electorall Prince of Bran∣denbourg.
He is a gracious Prince
to his people, and keeps a very
splendid court, having in his sta∣bles
for the use of himself and chil∣dren
no less than fifty two sets of
coach horses. he himself is Luthe∣ran,
but as his subjects are Chri∣stians
of different persuasions, nay
and some of them Jews too, so


both in his court and army he en∣tertains
Gentlemen of various opi∣nions
and Countries, as Italian ab∣bots,
and Gentlemen that serve him,
and many Calvinist French Officers:
neither is he so bigotted in his Re∣ligion
but that he and his Children
goe many times to Church with the
Princess who is a Calvinist, and
joine with her in her devotion.
His Countrey is good, having gold
and silver mines in it, and his sub∣jects
live well under him; as doe
those also of his brother the duke
of 
Lunenbourg,
 and their Cozen the
duke of 
Wolfembottel,
 which are
the three Princes of the house of

Lunenbourg;
 of whom it may be
said that they have alwayes stuck
honestly to the right side, and be∣friended
the interests of the Em∣pire;
so that no by respect, neither
honour nor profit, could ever pre∣vail
with them, as it has with others,
to make them abandon the publick
concern.



From this Princes court I went
to 
Zell
 the residence of the duke
the elder brother of the familie.
This Prince is called the mighty

Nimrod
 becaus of the great delight
he takes in horses, dogs and hunting.
He did mee the honour to let mee
she his stables, wherein he keeps 370
horses most of them English, or of
English breed. His dogs which
are also English, are so many, that
with great care they are quartered
in severall apartments according to
their Kind and qualities, there being
a large office like a brewhouse em∣ployed
for boyling of malt and Corn
for them. It is this valiant Prince
who tooke 
Tieves
 from the French,
and made the 
Mareshall do Crequi

prisoner: he is extreamely obliging
to strangers, and hath severall brave
Scottish Officers under his pay, as
Major General 
Erskin, Graham,
Goloman, Hamilton Melvin
 and
others. His Lieutenant General is
one 
Chavot
 a Protestant of 
Alsatia



an excellent and experienced com∣mander;
who did mee the honour
to treat mee three days at his house,
where with all his 
Scottish
 and 
En∣glish

Officers, whom he had invi∣ted,
wee liberally drank to the
health of our present King, having,
as he told us, served under his
Majestie, when duke of 
York,
 both
in 
France
 and 
Flanders,
 where he
gained the reputation both for skill
and conduct in the wars not onely
from Mareshall 
Turin
 a competent
Judge, but also from all other Ge∣neral
Persons who had the honour
to know him, that fame hath made
better know'n in the world than the
encomium which that generous
Gentleman ingenuously gave, and
which heere I spare to relate. I shall
adde no more concerning this
Prince, his Officers, or Countrey;
but that he with the other two Prin∣ces
of the house of 
Lunenbourg Ha∣nover

and 
Wolfenbottel,
 can upon
occasion bring into the field 36000


Soldiers whom they keep in constant
pay, and such men as I never saw
better in my life.


After some stay at the Court of
the duke of 
Zell
 I went to 
Ham∣bourg

a famous Hansiatick town.
It is a republick and city of great
trade, occasioned partly by the
English Company of Merchant ad∣ventures,
but much more by the
dutch Protestants who in the time
of the 
Duke of Alba
 forsook the low
Countries and seltled here, and
the Protestants also who were tur∣ned
out of 
Cologne
 and other places
in Germany; who nevertheless are
not now allowed publick Churches
within the citie, but at a place cal∣led

Altena
 a village belonging to
the King of 
Denmark,
 a quarter of
an houres walk distant from 
Ham∣bourg.

This Commonwealth is
Lutheran and governed by four

Burgemasters,
 twenty four 
Radts∣heres,

and a common Council of
all the Burghers who have above


40 schellings 
per annum
 free hold.
The symbole or Motto under their
Armes is, 
da pacem domine in diebus
nostris,
 and in their Standart are
these letters S. P. Q. H. The
people here grone under heavy tax∣es
and impositions; The State be∣caus
of continuall Alarms they have
from the King of 
Denmark
 or other
neighbours; and the intestine
broiles that frequently happen here,
as well as at 
Cologne,
 where the
Burgemasters are often in danger of
their lives from the mutinous mo∣bile;
being forced to maintain six
or seaven thousand men in pay, be∣sides
two or three men of war to
guard their havens from pirats. I
shall not name all the wayes of im∣posing
taxes which this Com∣monwealth
uses, becaus in most
they imitate the methods of the

States Generall
 as to that, which
have bin mentioned before: I shall
onely take notice of some peculiar
customes they have, wherein they


differ from Holland. When a Bar∣ber,
shoe maker, or any other Ar∣tizan
dies, leaving a widow and
Children, another of the same trade
is not admitted to set up for him∣self
as a master; unless he com∣pound
with the widow for a piece
of money, or else marry her, or a
daughter of hers with her con∣sent.


If any man cause another to be
arrested for debt or upon any other
suit, the plaintif must goe along
with the Officer who arrests the
party and stay by him untill the pri∣soner
be examined by the sheriff;
so that if the sheriff be not to be
spoken with that night, the plaintiff
must tarry with the prisoner all
night, untill the sheriff examine
the matter, and see cause of dis∣charging
or committing the party;
but this a plaintiff may doe by a pro∣curation
Notariall.


If a prisoner be committed for
debt, the plaintiff must maintain


him in prison according to his qua∣litie:
and if the party lye in prison
during the space of six yeares, at
the expiration of that time the pri∣soner
is discharged; and if during
the time of his imprisonment, the
plaintif doe not punctually pay the
prisoners allowance at the months
end, the prisoner is set at liberty,
and nevertheless the plaintiff must
pay the Gailer the last months al∣lowance.


This state is severe in the execu∣tion
of Justice against thieves,
murders and cheats. There is
no pardon to be expected for mur∣der,
and a Burgemaster himself if
guilty cannot escape. The punish∣ment
for Murder is here as in

Sweden,
 breaking malefactors on
the wheele, pinching their breasts
and Arms with hot Pincers, speeting
them in at the fundament and out at
the shoulder, they have also cruel
wayes of torturing to make prisoners
confess; And are very carefull not to


be cheated in their publick revenue;
their accisemen and collectors being
punished as in 
Holland.
 They take
a very good course not to be chea∣ted
in their accise; for all the mils
of the Countrey are in the hands
the State; so that no baker nor
brewer can grind his own corn, but
must have it ground at the States
mills, where they pay the accise.
There is a Generall tax upon all
houses, and that is the Eight penny,
which nevertheless does not excuse
them from chimney money. The
States here as at 
Genoa
 in Italy are
the publick vintners, of whom all
people must buy their wine, which
they buy from the Merchants, or
otherwise import it in their own
ships. In their ceremonies of bu∣rying
and Christening, they are
ridiculously prodigall; as for in∣stance.
If one invite a Burgema∣ster,
he must give him a ducat in
gold, if a 
Ra
dtsheer,
 that is, an
Alderman, a Rixdollar, to every


Preacher, Doctor of Physick, Ad∣vocat
or Secretary halfe a Rixdollar,
and to every Schoolmaster the third
part of a Rixdoller. The women
are the inviters to Burialls, wed∣dings
and Christenings, who weare
an Antick Kind of a dress, having
mitered caps as high again as the
Miter of a Bishop. The Churches
here are rich in revenues, and or∣naments,
as Images and Stately
Organs wherein they much delight.
They are great lovers of Musick;
in so much that I have told 
5
masters of severall sorts of Musick
in one Church, besides those who
were in the Organ-gallery. Their
Organs are extraordinarely large.
I measured the great pipes in the
Organs of St. 
Catharins
 and St.

James's
 Churches, and found them
to be 3 foot and 3 quarters in cir∣cumference
and 32 foot long; in
each of which Organs there are two
Pipes 5 foot and 8 inches round.
The wealth and trade of this


citie encreases dayly: They send one
year with another 70 Ships to
Greenland, and have wonderfully
engrossed that trade from 
England

and 
Holland,
 and it is beleeved
that small and great there are be∣longing
to this Commonwealth five
thousand sayl of Ships. After 
Am∣sterdam,
Genoa,
 and 
Venice
 their
bank is reckoned the chiefe in cre∣dit;
but in trade they are accoun∣ted
the third in Europe, and come
next to 
London
 and 
Amsterdam.
Hambourg
 is now become the Ma∣gazine
of Germany and of the bal∣tick
and northern seas. They give
great priviledges to the Jewes, and
to all strangers whatsoever, Espe∣cially
the English Company of
Merchant Adventures, whom they
allow a large building, where they
have a Church, and where the de∣puty
governour, Secretary, Mi∣nister,
and the other Officers
of the Company live, to whom
they yearly make present of Wine,


Beere, Sheep, Salmond and Stur∣geon
in their seasons. And so much
of 
Hambourg.


From 
Hambourg
 I went to 
Lu∣beck,

which is also a Com∣monwealth
and Imperiall town. It
is a large well built city contai∣ning
ten parish Churches; the Ca∣thedrall
dedicated to St. 
Peter
 being
in length 500 foot, with two high
spires all covered with brass as the
rest of the Churches of that city
are. In former times this city was
the place where the deputies of all
the Hansiatick towns assembled,
and was once so powerfull as to make
war against 
Denmark
 and 
Sweden,

and to conquer severall places and
Islands belonging to those two
Crowns, nay and to lend Ships to
England and other Potentates,
without any prejudice to their own
trade, wherein they vied in all parts
with their neighbours; but it is
now exceedingly run into decay not
onely in territories, but in wealth


and trade also. And the reason of
that was chiefely the inconsiderate
zeal of their Lutheran Minister{us}
who perswaded the Magistrates to
banish all Roman Catholicks,
Calvinists, Jews, and all that dissen∣ted
from them in matter of Reli∣gion,
even the English Company
too, who all went and setled in

Hambourg,
 to the great advantage
of that city and almost ruine of

Lubeck,
 which hath not now above
200 Ships belonging to it, nor
more territories to the State; than
the city it self and a small part cal∣led

Termond
 about eight miles di∣stant
from it. The rest of there ter∣ritories
are now in the possession of
the 
Danes
 and 
Swedes,
 by whom
the burghers are so continually al∣larmed,
that they are quite tired
out with keeping guard and paying
of Taxes. The city is indeed well
fortified; but the government not
being able to maintain above 1500
Soldiers in pay, 400 Eurghers


in two Companies are obliged to
watch every day. They have a
large well built Stathouse, and an
Exchange covered, on the top
whereof the globes of the world
are painted. This Exchange is
about fifty yards in the length; and
but fifteen in breadth; over it there
is a Roome where the skins of five
Lions which the Burghers killed at
the city gates in the year 1252 are
kept stuft. The great market place
is very large where a monumentall
stone is to be seen, on which one
of their Burgemasters was beheaded
for running away without fighting
in a sea engagement. The people
here spend much time in their
Churches at devotion, which con∣sists
chiefely in singing. The women
are beautifull but disfigured with
a kind of Antick dress; they wea∣ring
cloaks like men. It is cheap
living in this town; for one may
hire a palace for a matter of 20

 a year, and have provisions at


very reasonable rates: besides the air
and water is very good; the city being
supplied with fountains of Excel∣lent
fresh water, which 
Hambourg

wants; and good ground for cel∣lerage,
there being cellars here fourty
or fifty foot deep.


I had the curiosity to goe from

Lubeck
 to see the Ancient city of

Magdeburg,
 but found it so ruined
and decayed by the Swedish war, that
I had no encouragement to stay
there. I therefore hastened to

Berlin
 the chiefe residence of the
Elector of 
Brandenbourg,
 at whose
Court I mett with a very In∣genuous
French Merchant who
tould me that he and divers other
Merchants were designed to have
lived in 
England,
 but were discou∣raged
by a letter sent from 
London,

by a French man that was removeing
from thence to 
Amsterdam,
 for
these following reason which I cop∣pied
out of his Letter; First because
the Reformed Religion is persecu∣ted


in 
England
 as it is in 
France,

the which I tould him was a great
untruth, for it is apparent that
they have been all along graciously
admitted, and received into his
Majesties Dominions, without inter∣ruption,
& allowed the free exercise
of their owne forme of worship, ac∣cording
to the Doctrine & discipline
of the Churches of 
France,
 nor can
they who converse with the French
Ministers either in 
France
 or 
Holland

be Ignorant, that the chiefest part,
if not all those Ministers are wil∣ling
to complye with the Church
of 
England,
 and it is Evident that
most of the 
Dutch
 and 
French
 Pro∣testants
(so called;) in 
Holland

make use of Organs in their Chur∣ches;


A second thing was that both
the bank of 
London
 and the Ban∣kers.
Gouldsmiths were all broak,
the which I tould this Frenchman
was not true altogether, for there are
many able Bankers whome I named


as 
Alderman Fowles, Alderman
Hornbey, Alderman Duncomb, Al∣derman
Founs, Mr. Thomas Cook,
Mr. Rob: Vyner, Mr. Childe,
Mr. Endes, Mr. Evans
 and
others well known to the world by
their solid dealling: neyther was the
Bank (as he called the Chamber of

London)
 broak, only it had been
under the management of a bad
Person whose designe was to bring
it into disgrace; besides there is the

East-India Company
 an unquestiona∣ble
securitie for those as have money
to dispose of, together with another
undeniable securitie which is Land.
Thirdly he saith, that in 
England

there is no Register, and therefore
many frauds in purchases & morga∣ges,
which begett teadious suites,
and renders both dangerous to trust;
Fourtly that if a man would purchase
land he cannot, being an Alien, un∣till
Naturalized. Fiftly that in

England
 there are so many plots
and Confusions in Government that


the Kingdome is hardly quiet
twenty yeares together.


Sixtly that false wittnesses were
so common in 
England
 and the
crime of perjury so slightly punished,
that no man could be safe in life or
Estate if he chanced to be in trouble.
Lastly he said that the 
English
 are
so restless and quarrelesome, that
they not only foment and cherish
Animosities amongst one another,
but are Every foot contriving and
plotting against their lawfull sove∣raign
and the Government. By such
surmises and insinuations as these
the 
French
 and Germans are scared
from trusting themselves and for∣tunes
in England and therefore
settle in 
Amsterdam, Hamburg
 and
other Cittyes, where there are Banks
and Registers; This I say is one
cause why there are now to be seene
at 
Amsterdam
 such vast numbers of

French
 and 
Germans
 who have
much inriched that Citty and raised
the rents of the houses 20 parcent,


and the silkeweavers grow also verie
rich keeping so many Almes Chil∣dren
to doe their work and having
all their labour without any charge
only for the teaching them their
trades; which hath lessened the
revenues of the 
French
 crown, and
will in tyme greately increase the
number of the States subjects, and
advance ther publick Incomes.


To say the truth the inconstancy
and wantonnesse of the 
English
 na∣tion,
especially of late tymes, when
no other cause could be given for
it, but to much ease and plenty,
is not only wondered at but refle∣cted
upon by foreigners; yet I am
morally certaine that could the peo∣ple
of 
England
 be once againe uni∣ted
in love and affection as they are
bound to be in duty and Interest,
and would they be as willing to con∣tribute
to their own hapines as
heaven hath been kind and liberal
in bestowing the meanes of it, with
a good and gratious Prince solicitous


for preserveing the same to them,
could wee be so blest as wee have
great reason to Expect wee may
under the Auspicious reigne of him
whose royall Virtues are dreaded
by none either at home or a broad
but such as are the disturbers of
publick and lawfull Authoritie.


Having made this digression, I return
to 
Berlin,
 It is a city lately enlarged
with fair streets and palaces. The
Magistrates of the place are Luthe∣rans,
which is the publick establi∣shed
Religion in all the Electors
dominions; though he himself and
his Children be Calvinists. He is
lookt upon to be so true to that
persuasion, that he is reckoned the
Protector of the Calvinists; and
indeed he sollicited the Emperour
very hard for a toleration of the
Protestants in Hungary. His cha∣plains,
as most of the Lutheran
ministers also, endeavour to imi∣tate
the English in their way of
preaching: and his highness is so


much taken with English divinity,
that he entertains divines for trans∣lating
English books into the Ger∣man
tongue, as 
the whole duty of
man
 and severall others. He has a
large and Srately palace at 
Berlin
 and
therein a copious library enriched
with many manuscripts, medalls,
and rarities of Antiquity. He may
compare with most Princes for hand∣some
guards, being all of them
proper well bodied men, and most
part Officers who ride in his guards
of horse. As he is know'n in the
world to be a valiant and warlick
Prince, so he maintains in pay an
Army of 36000 men; besides five or
six thousand horsmen, who in time
of war are modelled into troopes;
with which body during the late
war with 
Sweden,
 his highness in
Person beat the 
Swedes
 out of his
Countrey. Hee keeps his forces
in strickt Discipline, obliging all the
Officers, if Protestants, on Sun∣days
and holy days to march their se∣verall


Companies in order to
Church, but if a superiour Offi∣cer
be of a contrary persuasion,
then the next in commission supplies
his place. This custome is Reli∣giously
observed by all his highnes∣ses
garrisons; whilest he himself
with his Children, being five sons,
two Daughters, and two Daugh∣ters
in law, goe constantly to the
Calvinist Church adjoyning to the
Court. Amongst other acts of pu∣blick
pietie and charitie, this Prince
hath established and endowed some
Religious houses or Nunneries for
Protestant young ladies, where they
may live virtuously and spend their
time in devotion as long as they
please, or otherwise marry, if they
think fit, but then they lose the be∣nefit
of the Monastery. There is
one of these at 
Herford
 in West∣phalia,
where I was and had the
honour to wait upon the Lady Ab∣bess
the Princess 
Elisabeth,
 eldest
sister of the Elector Palatine and


Prince 
Rupert,
 who is since dead.
Notwithstanding the late wars with

Sweden
 and that by the prevalency
of 
France
 in that hasty treaty of
peace concluded at 
Nimwegen,
 his
Electorall Highness was obliged to
give back what he had Justly taken
from that crown; yet his subjects
flourish in wealth and trade, his
highness having encouraged manu∣factures
of all sorts, by inviting Ar∣tizans
into his dominions, and esta∣lished
a Company of tradeing Mer∣chants
to the West-Indies, which
will much advance navigation a∣mongst
his subjects. And in all
humane probabilitie they are like to
continue in a happy condition, seing
by the alliances his highness hath
made with the Protestant Princes of
the Empire, and especially the house
of 
Lunenbourg,
 they are in no danger
of being disturbed by their neigh∣bours.
I told you before that the
Prince of 
Brandenbourg
 was married
to the Daughter of the duke of



Hanover,
 so that so long as that al∣liance
holds, the families of 
Bran∣denbourg

and 
Lunenbourg
 will be
in a condition to cast the ballance
of the Empire; they both together
being able to bring into the field
80000 as good men as any are in
Europe.


When I parted from 
Berlin
 I
made a turn back to 
Lunenbourg

in my way to Swedland, where I
found severall of my Countrey men
Officers in the garison, who shew'd
mee what was most remarkeable in
the city, as the Saltworks (which
bring in considerable summes of
money to the duke of 
Lunen∣bourg)

the Stathouse, and Churches,
in one of which I saw a communion
table of pure ducat gold. From
thence I went into the Province of
of 
Holstein,
 and at a small sea port
called 
Termond,
 of which I spake,
before, I embarked for 
Sweden.


He that hath read in the histories
of this last age the great exploits of



Gustavus Adolphus
 and his 
Swedes,

perhaps may have a fancy that it
must be an excellent Countrey which
hath bredsuch warriours; but if he
approach it, he will soon find him∣self
undeceived. Entering into

Sweedland
 at a place called 
Lands∣ort,

wee sailed forwards amongst
high rocks having no other prospect
from Land but mountains till wee
came to 
Dollers,
 which is about
four Swedish, that is, twenty four
English miles from 
Stockholm,
 the
capitall citie of the Kingdome: upon
my comeing a shore I confess I
was a litle surprised to see the
poverty of the people; and the
litle wooden houses they lived in,
not unlike Soldiers huts in a leaguer;
but much more, when I discove∣red
litle else in the Countrey but
mountanous rocks and standing
lakes of water. The Reader will
excuse mee, I hope, if I remarke
not all that I may have taken no∣tice
of in this Countrey, seing by


what I have already written, he may
perceive that my designe is rather
to observe the manner of the inha∣bitants
living, then to give a full
description of every thing that may
be seen in the Countrey they live in.
However I shall say somewhat of
that too, having premised once
for all that the ordinary people are
wretchedly poor; yet not so much
occasioned by the Publick taxes,
as the barrenness of their Countrey,
and the oppression of the nobles
their Landlords, and immediate su∣periours,
who till the present King
put a stop to their violences, ty∣rannically
domineered over the
lives and fortunes of the poor pea∣sants.
From 
Dollers
 I took waggon
to 
Stockholm,
 changing horses three
times by the way, by reason of the
badness of the rode, on all hands
environed with rocks, that hardly
open so much as here and there to
leave a shred of plain ground. At
two miles distance upon that rode


the citie of 
Stockholme
 looks great;
becaus of the Kings palace, the hou∣ses
of Noblemen, and some Chur∣ches
which are seated upon rocks;
and indeed, the whole citie and
suburbs stand upon rocks, unless it
be some few houses built upon
ground gained from the rivers that
run throw the town. 
Stockholme

has its name from a stock or logg
of wood which three brothers threw
into the water five miles above the
city, making a vow that where
ever that stock should stop, they
would build a castle to dwell in.
The stock stopt at the Holme or
rock where the palace of the King
now stands; and the brothers to
be as good as their word, there
built their castle, which invited
others to doe the like; so that in
process of time the other rocks or
holmes were covered with buildings
which at length became the capital
citie of the Kingdome. It is now
embellished with a great many


Stately houses, and much emproved
from what it was 4
0 yeares agoe,
as indeed, most cities are; for the
Stathouse then built, is so con∣temtible
and low that in 
Hol∣land

or 
England,
 it would not be
suffered to stand to disgrace the na∣tion.
The Council Chamber where
the Burgemaster and 
Raedt
 sit, is
two rooms cast into one not above
nine foot high; and the two rooms
where the sheriffs and the Erve col∣ledge
(which is a Judicature like to
the 
Doctors Commons
 in England) sit
are not above eight foot and a halfe
high. The Kings Palace is a large
square of stone building, in some
places very high, but an old and
irregular fabrick, without a suffi∣cient
quantitie of ground about it
for gardens and walks. It was an∣ciently
surrounded with water; but
some yeares since part of it was filled
up to make a way from the castlegate
down into the old town. In this
Palace there are large rooms; but


the lodgings of the King, Queen
and Royall familie are three pair of
stairs high, the rooms in the first and
second story's being destin'd for the
Senat Chamber and other courts of
Judicature. The Kings library is
four pair of stairs high, being a room
about fourty six foot square, with
a closet adjoyning to it not half the
dimensions. When I considered
the appartments and furniture of
this Court, I began to think that
the French Author wrote truth, who
in his Remarks upon Swedland sayes,
that when Queen 
Christina
 resigned
the Crown to 
Carolus Gustaphus
 the
father of this present King, she
disposed of the best of the furniture
of the Court, and gave away a large
share of the Crown lands to her favo∣rites;
in so much that the King
considering the poor condition she
had left the Kingdome in, and
seeing the Court so meanely furni∣shed,
said that had he know'n be∣fore
he accepted the Crown, what


then he did, he would have taken
other measures.


There are many other Stately pa∣laces
in 
Stockholme
 belonging to the
nobilitie; but many of them for
want of repairs, and not being inhabi∣ted
run to ruine; severall of the
nobles who lived in them formerly,
having lost the estates that maintai∣ned
their ancient splendour, as wee
shall see hereafter, being retired
unto a Countrey life. There are
also some other magnificent stru∣ctures
begun, but not finished, as
that Stately building intended for
a Parliament house for the nobles,
and two or three Churches: but
what I most wonder at is the vault
wherein the late King lies buried, is
not as yet covered but with boards,
for it is to he observed that the Kings
of 
Sweeden
 have no tombs and
monuments as in England and other
Countries; but are put into copper
coffins with inscriptions on them,
and placed one by another in vaults


adjoyning to the Gray Friers Church.
These vaults are about Eight in num∣ber,
having turets over them with
vains of Copper gilt, carved into
the ciphers of the severall Kings
who give them their names by being
the first that are interred in them.
The vault of the late King is not
yet finished, no more then the fa∣bricks
above mentioned, which per∣haps
may be imputed to the late
troubles of 
Swedland.
 The num∣ber
of the inhabitants of 
Stockholme

are also much decreased within these
few yeares, partly by reason of the
removal of the Court of Admiraltie
and the Kings Ships from that citie to

Charles-crown,
 a new haven lately
made about 200 English miles from
thence, which hath draw'n many
families belonging to the fleet and
Admiralitie from 
Stockholme
 to live
there: and partly becaus many of
the nobilitie, gentry and those that
depended on them, are, as I said
before, withdraw'n from 
Stock∣holme



to a retired life in the Coun∣trey.
Nevertheless the ordinary
sort of Bourghers who still remain
are extreamly poor; seing the women
are fain to worke like horses, drawing
carts, and as labourers in England,
serving masons and bricklayers with
stone, bricks and mortar, and unloa∣ding
vessells that bring those mate∣rials;
some of the poor creatures in the
summertime toyling in their smocks
without either shoes or stockings.
They performe also the part of wa∣termen,
and for a small matter will
row passengers 40 miles or more if
they please.


The Court here is very thin and
silent, the King living frugally & sel∣dome
dining in publick He eats
commonly with 
the two Queens

his mother and consort, who is a
virtuous Princess sister to the King
of Denmark. She is the mother of
five Children, three sons and two
daughters, with whom she spends
most of her time in retirement. The


King is a goodly Prince whom God
hath blessed and endowed with ac∣complishments
far beyond what
might have been expected from his
education, wherein he was ex∣treamly
abused, being taught litle
more than his mother tongue. He
is gracious, Just and valiant, con∣stant
at his devotion, and utterly
averse from all kind of debauchery,
and the unfashionable vanities of
other courts in playes, and danceing.


His Sports are hunting and exer∣ciseing
of his guards, and he rarely
appeares publickly or gives audience
to strangers, which is imputed to
his sense of the neglect of his edu∣cation.
He is a Prince that hath
had a very hard beginning in the
world, which hath many times
proved fortunate to great men; and
indeed, if wee consider all the cir∣cumstances
of his early misfortunes,
how he was slighted and neglected
by his nobles who would hardly
vouchsafe to pay him a visit when he


was among them in the Countrey,
or to doe him homage for the lands
they held of the Crown; and how
by the Pernicious councels of the
French and the weakeness or trea∣chery
of his governours he was
misled into a war that almost cost
him his Crown, having lost the
best of his territories in 
Germany

and 
Schonen,
 and most of his for∣ces
both by sea and land: If I say,
these things be considered, it will
probably appeare that hardly any
Prince before him hath in a shorter
time or more fully setled the Au∣thority
and prerogative of the
Crown, then he hath done in 
Swe∣den;

for which he stands no wayes
obliged to France, as he was for the
restauration of what he lost during
the war. He is now as absolute as
the French King, and makes Edicts
which have the force of Laws with
out the concurrence of the Estates
of the Kingdome. He hath erected
two Iudicatures the one called the


colledge of Reduction, and the
other of inspections; the first of
which hath put his Majesty in pos∣session
again of all lands alienated
from the Crown, and the other
called to account all persons even
the heires and executors of those
who had cheated the Crown, and
made them 
refound
 what they or
their predecessors had appropriated
to their own use of the Publick re∣venue.
These two necessary con∣stitutions,
as they have reduced
many great families to a pinch, who
formerly lived splendidly upon the
Crown lands and revenues, and
obliged them to live at home upon
their ancient and private Patrimonie
in the Countrey, which is one great
cause that the Court of 
Sweden
 is
at present so unfrequented; so have
they enabled his Majestie, without
burdening of his subjects, to sup∣port
the Charges of the govern∣ment,
and to maintain 64000 men
in pay. The truth is his other Re∣nues


are but small, seing Queen

Christina
 enjoys the best of his ter∣ritories,
as her allowance, and that
what arises from the Copper and
Iron mines, one Silver mine, the
Pitch and Tar, the customes and
excise amounts to no extraordinary
summ of money, & the land tax in
so barren a Countrey scarcely de∣serving
to be named. The customes
and excise, I confess, are very high,
and the rigorous manner of exa∣cting
them pernicious to trade; as for
instance. I
 a ship come to 
Stock∣holme

from 
London
 with a hundred
severall sorts of goods, and those
goods assigned to fifty several men
more or less; if any of those fifty
doe not pay the custome of what
belongs to him, though it be for
a barrel of Beer, the Ship shall not
be unladen, nor no man have his
goods out, though he hath fully
payed the customes for them, till
this last man hath payed his. There
are severall other silly customes in



Swedland
 that discourages men
from tradeing there; as if any stranger
die there, a third of his Estate must
goe to the city or town where he
traded. No forreigne Merchant in

Stockholm
 can travell into any Coun∣trey
where there is a faire without a
passport: and at present seing there
is no treaty of trade betwixt 
Eng∣land

and 
Sweden,
 though the Eng∣lish
bring as considerable a trade to
that Kingdome, as any other Coun∣trey
whatsoever, yet they are very
unkindly used by the Officers of the
custome house; whereas the 
Dutch,

in 
Lubeck,
 and other cities have new
and greater Priviledges allowed
them. Nor would I Counsel an
Englishman to goe to law with a
Swedish Burgher in 
Sweden,
 espe∣cially
if he be a Whiggish Scot who
hath got his freedome in 
Stockholme,

for those are a kind of skrapers, whom
I have observed to be more invete∣rate
against the 
English
 then the na∣tive
Sweeds.



Of all the Swedish army of 64000
men, the King keeps but 12 Com∣panies
of 200 men a peece, with
some few horse guards in 
Stockholme,

who are not upon duty as sentinels
at the Court gates, as at the Courts
of other Princes. The rest are di∣spersed
into quarters and garrisons
upon the fronteers which are so far
distant in that large compass of land
which his territories take up, that
it would require a hard and tedious
worck to bring them together to a
generall muster. They are however
kept under very strick discipline,
and those that lye neare often viewed
by the King. They have od sorts
of punishments for the Souldiers
and Officers of all degrees: for
example if a Serjeant or Corporall
be drunk or negligent on duty, they
are put into armour, and with three
muskets tied under each arm, made
to walke two hours before the
Court of guard: yet for all the seve∣ritie
of discipline used against the


Soldiers, they commit many abuses
in the night time, robbing and
sometimes killing men upon the
streets in 
Stockholme,
 where they
have no lights nor guards as in 
Cop∣penhaguen.

Informer times there
have been at one time thirty five
Collonels besides Generall Officers
in the Swedish Army all the subjects
of the King of great Britain, but
at present there are few or none,
unless it be the sons of some Scot∣tish
Officers deceased; nor did I
ever see an Englishmen in the Kings
guards horse or foot but one, and
the son of 
Sr. Eduard
 wood, who
hath since quitted the service. The
King hath exceedingly won the
hearts of the common people, not
onely by exempting them from the
tyrannical Jurisdiction of the nobi∣litie
and gentry, who formerly would
by their own private authority pu∣nish
and put to death the peasants
at their pleasure; which makes the
Countries very willing to quarter the


Kings Soldiers, but by his exactness
in punishing duels, murder and rob∣beries.
Perjury is death here also
as in Holland: which makes the
Magistrates in some ports of this
Kings territories enjoyns strange
kinds of oaths to deter men from
being forsworn. As for instance,
in some places, the witness is set,
with a staff in his hand, upon some
peeble stones and charcoale, where
he is to imprecate and pray, that
if what he sweareth be not true,
his land may become as barren as
those stones, and his substance be
consumed to ashes like the coals he
stands on, which as soon as he
steps down are set on fire. This
manner of swearing so terrifies
the people, that they commonly
tremble when they come to take
their oath.


The Religion of the dominions
of the King of 
Sweden,
 as of those
of the King of Denmark, and of
other Princes and states whom wee


have named is Lutheran; who are
more rigid to Roman Catho∣licks
and Calvinists than the Pro∣testanrs
of Germany. There is no
tolleration allowed here to Calvi∣nist
ministers; and they take an ef∣fectuall
course to keep the Countrey
clear of priests and Jesuits, by guel∣ding
them whether they be young
or old. In commemoration of the
great losses and desolation iustained
in the late war, the 
Swedes
 strictly
keep four fasting days in the months
of 
April, May, June
 and 
July;
 on
which days all men are prohibited
by Authority to kindle fire in their
houses, or to eat till after Evening
service is don, which in the winter
time could not be endured. They
delight much in singing in their
Churches, which they constantly
performe twice every day, morning,
and evening. In their maryings,
Christenings and buryings they are
so prodigally extravagant, that if
all three happen in one yeare to a


man of a competent estate, it is
enough to breake him, The clergy
of 
Sweden
 are neither so rich nor
learned as those of Germany, wan∣ting
both the opportunities of study,
and of conversing with learned men,
that those of other Countreys en∣joy;
though there be some learned
men amongst them. A Bishoprick
in 
Sweden
 is no great benefice, if
compared with some Personages in
England; for the Archbishop and
Metropolitan hath not above 400
L. 
per ann.
 and some of the rest are
not worth above 150 or 200 L. a
yeare. The inferiour Clergy are
not so regular in their lives and
conversation in the Countries di∣stant
from 
Stockholme,
 as they are
neare the court, and the reason is,
partly becaus they entertain tra∣vellers
that pass the Countrey, there
being no Ins in most places for the
accommodation of persons of any
qualitie, and so are obliged to drink
with their guests: and partly becaus


at buryings and Christenings, where
there is commonly high drinking,
the Pape or Parson is master of the
Ceremonies; And here give mee
leave, to tell a short story of one
of them. A Pape comeing to Chri∣sten
a Child in a Church, and find∣ing
a Scottish man to be Godfa∣ther,
was so transported either with
Zeal or his cups, that when he came
to exorcise the Child which is a rite
used in their Office of Administring
that Sacrament, He neglected the
forme prescribed by the liturgie, and
in an extemporary prayer begg'd
that the devill might depart out of
the Child, and enter into that
Scottish Heretick; for so they call
the Presbyterians of that nation.
The prayer of the Pape so incensed
the Scot that he vowed revenge,
and watched the Pape with a good
cudgell next day as he crossed the
Church yard, where he beat him
and left him all in blood lying on
the ground and crying out murder.


For this fact the Scot was had before
the Justice, who asking him how
he durst be so bold as to lay his pro∣fane
hands upon the man of God,
He, who knew very well what use
to make of the devill he had got,
foaming at the mouth and cunningly
acting the demoniack, made an∣swer
that the Pape might thank
himself for what he had met with;
for since he had conjured the devill
into him he spared no body, nei∣ther
wife nor Children, nor would
he spare the Justice himself, and
with that sell a mangling and tearing
the Magistrat, that he was fain to
betake himself to his heeles, crying
out 
O! the devill, save mee;
 and
so the Scot marched home no man
daring to lay hold on him, for fear
of being torn to peeces by the de∣vill.
But the Justice recollecting
himself sent for the Pape, told him
that the Scot was a cunning rogue,
and bid him goe home, get a plai∣ster
for his head and be silent; least


if the matter came to the Bishops
ears, he might be censured for
goeing against the rubrick of the
liturgie.


The famous Universitie where
their Clergy are bred is 
Ʋpsall
 eight
Swedish miles from 
Stockholme.

There are commonly 150 or 200
Students there, but no endowed
colledges as in other Countries.
The library is so meane and con∣temptible
that the libraries of many
Grammar Schools and of privat
men in England or Holland are
far better stored with books then it
is. Upon viewing of it, and that of
the Kings Palace, I called to mind
the saying of a French man, upon
the like occasion; That 
Swedland

came behind 
France
 and 
England

in the knowledge of men and things
at least 800 yeares; yet some 
Swedes

have been so conceited of the an∣tiquity
of their Countrey, as to
bragg that Paradice was seated in

Sweden,
 that the Countrey was


turned into such heaps of rocks for
the rebellion of our first parents,
and that 
Adam
 and 
Eve
 had 
Cain

and 
Abel
 in a Countrey three 
Swe∣dish

miles distant from 
Ʋpsall.
 A
French man standing by and hearing
this Romantick story, as I was
told, fitted him with the like, tel∣ling
him that when the world was
made in six days, at the end of the
creation all the Rubbish that re∣mained
was throw'n together into
a corner, which made up 
Sweden

and Norway. And indeed the
French seeme to have no great like∣ing
to the Countrey, what ever
kindness they may have for the peo∣ple,
for a French Ambassadour, as
an author of that Countrey relates,
being by order of Queen Christina
treated in a Countrey house 4
Swedish miles from 
Stockholme,

and upon the rode goeing and co∣meing,
with all the varieties and
pleasures that the Countrey could
affoard, on purpose to make him


have a good opinion of the same;
made answere to the Queen (who
asked him upon his return what he
thought of 
Sweden)
 that were he
master of the whole Countrey, he
would presently sell it & buy a farme
in France or England; which, under
favour, I think was a litle tart and
sawcy.


Having stayed a considerable time
in Swedland, and most part at 
Stock∣holme,

I set out from thence to goe
to 
Elsenbourg
 by land, and went a
litle out of my way to see a small
city called 
Eubrone
 famous for a coat
of Arms which it got in this manner.
A certain Masculine Queen of

Denmark
 who had conquered a
great part of 
Sweden,
 comeing to
this city, asked the Magistrates,
what was the Arms of their city;
who having told her that they had
none, she plucked up her coats and
squatting upon the Snow, bid them
take the marke she left there for their
Arms: It's pity she did not give them


a suitable motto to it also. What
that figure is called in blazonerie
I know not, but to this day the
city uses it in their Armes, and for
marking their commodities. This
Queen came purposely into 
Swe∣den

to pay a visit to a brave woman
that opposed a King of 
Swedland,

who in a time of famine would have
put to death all the men and women
in his Countrey above sixty years
of age. The Countrey all the way
I travelled in 
Swedland
 is much of
the same qualitie of the land about

Stockholme,
 untill I came neare the
Province of 
Schonen
 which is cal∣led
the store house and Kitchin
of 
Sweden,
 where the Countrey is
far better. It was formerly very
dangerous to travell in this Pro∣vince
of 
Schonen,
 becaus of the
Snaphances who were a kind of
bloody robbers, now utterly de∣stroyed
by the King; so that it is
safe enough travelling there. En∣tering
into 
Schonen
 I saw twenty nine


of these rogues upon wheeles, and
elsewhere in the Countrey, ten and
twenty at severall places. The
King used great severitie in destroy∣ing
of them; some he caused to be
broken upon the wheele, others
speeted in at the fundament and out
at the shoulders, many had the flesh
pinched off of there breasts, and so
were fastened to stakes till they died,
and others again had their noses and
both hands cut off, and being sea∣red
with a hot Iron were let goe to
acquaint their camerades how they
had been served. The King is very
severe against Highway-men and
duellers. In above a hundred
miles travelling, wee found not a
house where there was either French
wine or brandie, which made mee
tell a 
Swede
 of our Company who
was travelling to Denmark, that I
would undertake to shew any man
500 houses wherein a traveller
might have wine and other good
accommodation in the space of an


hundred miles upon any rode from

London.
 There are severall small
towns and fertile land in this Coun∣trey
of 
Schonen,
 lying upon the

Sound;
 at the narrowest part
whereof lies 
Elsenbourg
 burnt down
by the Danes in the last war:
Here I crost over to 
Elsenore,

the passage being but a league
broad.


The King of Denmark has a castle
at 
Elsenore
 which commands the
narrow passage of the 
Sound,
 where
all Ships that enter into or come
out of the Baltick sea must pay
toll. Having visited this castle
and stai'd about a fortnight with
the English Consul, and 
Sr.
John Paul
 late resident at the
Court of 
Swedland,
 I went to
the danish Court at 
Coppenha∣guen.


Copenhaguen
 is the capitall city
of 
Zeeland, Jutland
 or 
Denmark

and place of residence of the King
It stands on a flat, encompassed


with a pleasant and delightfull Coun∣trey
much resembling England. The
streets of the city are kept very neat
and cleane, with lights in the night
time for the convenience and safe∣tie
of those who are then abroad;
a custome not as yet introduced
into 
Stockholme
 where it is dange∣rous
to be abroad when it is dark.
The Kings men of war lye here
very conveniently, being orderly
ranged betwixt 
Booms
 after the
manner of Amsterdam, and neare
the Admiralty house, which is a
large pile of building well furnished
with stores and Magazines, secured
by a citadell, that not onely com∣mands
the city, but also the Haven,
and entrey into it. The Court of
Denmark is splendid, and makes
a far greater figure in the world
then that of 
Sweden,
 tho not many
yeares agoe in the time of 
Carolus
Gustaphus
 the father of the present
King of 
Swedland,
 it was almost
reduced to its last, when the walls


of 
Copenhagen
 saved that Crown
and Kingdome. That siege was
famous, caried on with great
vigour by the 
Swede,
 and as bravely
maintained by the 
Danes:
 The
monuments whereof are to be seen
in the canon bullets gilt that still
remain in the walls of some houses
and in the steeple of the great Church
of the town. The Royall palace in

Copenhaguen
 is but small and a very
ancient building, but his Majesties
house 
Fredenburg
 is a stately fa∣brick
of Modern Architecture, and
very richly furnished. 
Denmark

is at present a flourishing Kingdome
and the King who hath now made
it hereditary, surpasses most of his
predecessours in power and wealth:
He hath much enlarged his domi∣nions,
aswell as Authority, and by
his personall and Royall virtues,
no less then the eminent qualities of
a great many able ministers of State,
he hath gained the universall love
of his subjects, and the esteeme of


all forreigne Princes and States.
The Court if much frequented eve∣ry
day, but especially on Sundays
where about eleven of the clock in
the morning, the Nobility, for∣reigne
Ministers, and Officers of
the Army assemble and make a glo∣rious
appeareance. There one may
see many Knights of the order of the
Elephant of 
Malto
 but I never saw
any order of the like nature as that of

Sweden,
 that King rarely appearing
in his George and garter, but on
days of publick audience I have
observed at one time above 150
coaches attending at the Court of
Denmark, which are ten times more
than ever I saw together at that
of 
Sweden.
 The King is affable
and of easy accels to strangers, seen
often abroad by his subjects in his
gardens and stables, which are very
large and well furnished with all
sorts of Horses. He is a great lover
of English horses and dogs, and
delights much in Hunting, as his


eldest son the Prince with his bro∣thers
doe in cockfighting; in so
much that the English Merchants
can not make a more acceptable pre∣sent
to those Princes, then of En∣glish
game-cocks. The standing for∣ces
of 
Denmark
 are well disciplined
men, and commanded by good
Officers both natives and stran∣gers,
both 
French
 and 
Scots,
 as
Major General 
Duncan,
 and Major
General 
Veldun
 both Scottish∣men,
whom I saw at 
Copenhaguen.

The Soldiers, aswell as courtiers are
quartered upon the citizens, a cu∣stome
which is likewise practised in

Sweden,
 and tho somewhat uneasy,
yet not repined at by the people
who by the care and good govern∣ment
of the King find trade much
advanced. For his Majestie by en∣couraging
strangers of all religions
to live in his dominions, and allow∣ing
the French and dutch Calvinists,
to have publick Churches, hath
brought many tradeing families to



Coppenhaguen,
 and by the measure
he hath taken for settling trade in
prohibiting the importation of for∣reigne
manufactures, and reforming
and new modelling the East and
West India Companies, hath much
encreased commerce and thereby
the wealth of his subjects; so that
notwithstanding the new taxes im∣posed
upon all coaches, waggons,
Ploughs, and all reall and perso∣nall
estates, which amount to con∣siderable
summs of money, the
people live very well and conten∣ted.
There are commonly about
eight thousand men in garison in

Coppenhaguen,
 and his Majesties Re∣giment
of foot guards who are all
cloathed in red, with cloaks to keep
them warm in the winter time, is
a very handsome body of men, and
with the horse guards who are
bravely mounted, and have their gra∣nadeers
and Hoboyes, make a very
fine shew. His Majestie hath cau∣sed
severall new fortifications to be


built upon the 
Elb,
 and other rivers,
and hath now in his possession that
strong Castle called 
Hilgueland,

at present commanded by a Scottish∣man.
The Queen of 
Denmark
 is a
most virtuous Princess, sister to
the present Landgrave of 
Hessel-Cassel,

and in persuasion a Calvi∣nist,
having a chappell allowed her
within the Court; though the pu∣blick
religion of the King and King∣dome
be Lutheran. The Clergie
here are learned, many of them
having studied at 
Oxford
 and 
Cam∣bridge

where they learnt the English
Language, and amongst the Bishops
there is one Doctor 
King
 the son of
a Scottishman. But seing it is my
designe rather to observe the con∣dition
of the people, then to be
punctuall in describing all the rari∣ties
that are remarkeable in the
Countries I have been in, I shall
conclude what I have to say of 
Den∣mark,

by acquainting the Reader
that the people of that Countrey


live far better then the 
Swedes,

and aswell as most of their adjoyning
neighbours; and that there are seve∣rall
places, both there and in 
Nor∣way.

which have the names of En∣glish
towns, as 
Arundale, Totness,
London
 &c.


When I fist began to write this
treatise, I had some thoughts of
making observations upon the seve∣rall
governments of other States and
Dominions, where I had travelled
some years before I was in the
Countries I have been speaking of,
as of the rest of Germany, Hun∣gary,

Switzerland, Italy
 and France;
but that was a subject so large,
and the usefulness of it to my present
designe so inconsiderable, that by
doeing so, I found I could neither
satisfie the curious, by adding any
thing materiall to those many who
have already obliged the publick by
the remarks of their travells in those
places; or make my discontented
Countrey men more averse then


they are already from removing
into those Countries, where I think
few of them will chuse to transport
themselves for the sake of liberty and
Propertie, tho England were even
worse, than they themselves fancy it
can be. All that remains to be
done then, is to conclude this trea∣tise
with an obvious and popular
remark, that those Countries where
cities are greatest and most frequen∣ted
by voluntary inhabitants, are
alwayes the best to live in; and by
comparing the city of 
London
 with
all other cities of Europe, and de∣monstrating
by the surveys I have
made (which I think will hardly be
contradicted or confuted,) that of
all the capitall cities of Europe it is
the biggest, and most populous, & so
prove consequentially that England,
for the generality of people, is the
best Countrey in the world espe∣cially
for its natives to live in. Now
this being an observation, (for
what I know) not hitherto made


good by induction and instance,
(as I intend to doe it) I hope it
will please the Reader as much, as
if I gave him a particular account of
other Countreys and governments,
and leave it to his own reflexion to
State the comparison.


Though 
London
 within the walls
cannot vie for bigness with many
cities of Europe; yet take the city
and suburbs together, according
as it hath been surveyed by 
Mr.
Morgan,
 in breadth from 
St.
Georges
 Church in Southwarke to
Shore ditch, and in length from
Limehouse to petty France in 
West∣minster

and it is in a vast proportion
larger in compass of ground, and
number of houses then any city
whatsoever in Europe. This I
shall demonstrate first by compare∣ing
it with some cities of Hol∣land,
and then with the most con∣siderable
cities of the other Coun∣tries
of Europe, which I shall set
down in an alphabeticall order with


the number of the houses they seve∣rally
contain.


When 
London
 and suburbs was
surveyed some years agoe by 
Mr.
Morgan,
 there were reckoned to
be in it 84000 houses besides hospi∣talls,
Almeshouses, and other
buildings that payed no chimney
money to the King: Now if those
were added, and the vast number
of new houses that have been built
since that survey, upon modest
computation 
London
 may be recko∣ned
to countain 100000 houses;
I know the 
French
 doe vapour and
would perswade the world that 
Pa∣ris

is much bigger then 
London.

And the 
Hollanders
 will scarce be∣lieve
that 
London
 hath more 
Houses

then the 18 
Cittyes
 in 
Holland
 that
have voyces in the States, for say
they 
Amsterdam
 Stands upon a 1000

Morgens
 land, and 
London
 Stands
but upon 1800; To both which I
answer, that it is very true that

Paris
 takes up a great spot of ground,


but then you must consider, that in

Paris
 there are severall hundreds of

Monasteries, Churches, Coledges,

and 
Cloysters,
 some of them haveing
large 
Gardens,
 and that in 
Paris

there are 7500 
Palaces
 and 
Ports

for 
Coaches,
 which have likewise
great 
Gardens,
 whereas 
London
 is
very thick built, and in the 
Citty
 the

Houses
 have scarce a Yard big
enough to sett a 
Pump,
 or 
House
 of
conveniency in; but the weekely
bills of 
Mortality
 will decide this

Question
 and plainely give it to

London,
 and so doth 
Mons: la Cour,

and Sir. 
William Pette
 in his last

Essayes
 dedicated lately to our King,
makeing it appeare that 
London
 is
bigger then 
Paris, Rhoan,
 and 
Ro∣chell

altogether; and as for 
Amster∣dam

I doe appeale to all knowing
men that have seen it, that although
it be true that it Stands upon 1000

Morgens Land;
 yet there is not
above 400 
Morgens
 built, and this I
prove thus, that the large 
Gardens,



on the 
Heeregraft, Kysersgraft,

and 
Princegraft,
 and the 
Burgavalls

of 
Amsterdam
 take up more then a
third part of the 
Citty,
 then reckon
the 
Bastions,
 and the space of

Ground
 betweene the 
Wall,
 and
the 
Houses,
 and all the 
Ground

unbuilt from the 
Ʋtricks-Port,
 to
the 
Wesoper-Port, Muyer-Port,
 and
so to the 
Seasido,
 and you will find
it to be near 300 
Morgens land:

There are 2 
Parishes
 in the 
Sub∣urbs

of 
London,
 viz 
Stepuey,
 and

St. Martins
 in the fields, (the later
being so big that the last Parlement
divided it into 4 
Parishes,)
 either
of them have more 
Houses
 then

Rotterdam,
 or 
Harlem,
 and there
are severall other great 
Parishes
 as

St. Margrets-Westminster, St.
Giles
 in the fields, 
Toolyes,
 and 
St.
Mary Overs,
 the which if they stood
apart in the Country would make
great 
Cittyes,
 wee reckon in 
London

and the 
Suburbs
 thereof to be at least

130 Parishes,
 which containe



100000 Houses,
 now if you reckon

8 persons
 to everie house then there
are neare 800000 soules in 
London,

but there are some that say there is a
million of soules in it; I shall
now set downe the 
Cittyes Alphabe∣tically

and their number of 
Houses

as they were given to me not only
from the 
Surveyours
 and 
Citty Car∣penters,

but from the 
Bookes
 of the

Herthmoney,
 and bookes of the

Verpoundings,
 where such 
Taxes

are payd; and first I shall begin
with the 18 
Cittyes
 that have Voyces
in the 
States
 of Holland.
