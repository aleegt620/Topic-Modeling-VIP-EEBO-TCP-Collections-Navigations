A LETTER To a FRIEND, Concerning the 
East-India
 Trade.


SIR,


HAving lately received from you the 
East-India
 Company's Answers to the Rea∣sons for a Regulated Company, together with their Reasons why a Joint-Stock will Best carry on the Trade; and your Commands to give you my Opinion therein, I most willing∣ly submit thereto, in hopes that I may thereby Convince you, and Confute them. I shall take them in order as they lye in their own Paper.




1st. To the Trade's being more Extensive in a Regulated Company: They Answer, and say, 
That tho' it be a specious Argument, yet it is in Fact, directly contrary; for in the
 Muscovy, Turkey, Hamborouh, and East-Land 
Companies, which are the only Regulated Companies in
 England, 
there are not so many actual Traders, as there are Persons Concern∣ed in the present
 East-India 
Joint-Stock;
 to which they add, 
That in a Regulated Company, the same is Circumscribed to Experienced Trading Merchants, and no others; whereas in this Trade to
 India, 
all de∣grees of Persons, of the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy Wi∣dows and Orphans, as well as Merchants, are, or may be Concerned in it, although not skilled in Trade.


If by Extensive, they mean the Sum of Money Em∣ployed, a Joint Stock is no more Confined to a parti∣cular Sum of Money, than a Regulated Company: But can with great Ease extend the Trade to the utmost de∣gree, as the Nature thereof is capable.


If the 
East-India
 Company mean there are not half so many actual Traders in one of these four Companies, as there are Persons Concerned in the 
East-India
 Joint Stock, I do grant it them; for none can imagin there is occasion for so many Traders to 
Archangle,
 the only Port the 
Muscovia
 Company Trade to, and requires not above For∣ty Thousond Pounds Stock.


But if they mean in all the Four Companies, then they are grosly mistaken; there are above two thousand 
English
 Men actual Traders to those Places, within the limits of those Companies Charters, besides Foreigners, which are near as many more. And were those Trades Restrain'd

to the 
English
 only, there would be more than three times the Number of the 
English
 Subjects Employed in that narrow Compass of Trade, than there are Concerned in the present Joint 
East-Inda
 Stock, whose Charter extends to far greater Territories than all 
Europe.


Of the home Trades, experienced Merchants have generally the Advantage, though these want no Instances of several Persons Employing the E∣states of others, that are not Traders, with their own in a joint Interest. But to Evidence clear∣ly to you, that were this Trade setled in a Re∣gulated Company, the Nobility, Gentry, Wi∣dows, and Orphans, would have greater Oppor∣tunities at all times to be concerned, than in a Joint Stock: I offer as an Instance those Trading Ships which they call 
Interlopers,
 in which not above one third of the Persons Concerned are Merchants, but their Stock is made up by voluntary Sub∣scriptions, of all degrees of Persons, who Chuse known Experienced Merchants to Manage it for them, in which every Subscriber hath a Vote; and no body can deny, but those who desire it may have several opportunities Yearly, of Enga∣ging themselves in such particular Joint Stocks, without excluding all others, whose Circumstan∣ces will not at this time suffer them to Trade to 
India;
 and it is beyond all question, That those Merchants chosen fairly by every Adventurer, because of their Experience and Honesty, are fit∣est and ablest to carry it on, and much better than a Committee Chosen by Art, for some by purposes in Joint Stocks, without Regard had to

their Fitness and Qualifications. And those Top∣ping Men, who Influence the Choice of the Committees, do, and by their Interest are bound to Confine their Trade to particular Sums, and will not in any kind extend them to the Ad∣vantage of the Nation, beyond their stated Pro∣fits and private Designs; witness the many Di∣vidents the 
East-India
 Campany have made, un∣til they had nothing left them, on purpose (to use their own Words) to put themselves out of the Power of a Parliament; after this, some of them lent the Stock 50 
per Cent,
 at Interest, and since that, they made an Addition to their Stock, as they so called it, by a new Subscription up∣on their late Charter; but how much of this New Subscription-Money was left for them to trade withal, I leave you to judge, when you shall have deducted the 10 
per Cent.
 abatement, 50 
per Cent.
 advanced, the Money exhausted for secret Service, the loss of their Stock Subscribed by their own Members for the Company's Accompt, on purpose to draw in Honest and Harmless Mo∣neyed Men, and what they Owed at Interest here in 
India
 before all this; by which means they have sunk most of their Stock, starved and dwind∣led the Trade, nor had any Ships from 
China
 this long time, and in a manner lost the Pepper Trade to the 
Dutch.


In their Second Answer they say, 
It must be distinguished, whether it's meant one Buyer in
 England, 
or
 India; 
if in
 England, 
a Joint Stock must buy in Common with others. As to Selling, the Goods of a joint Stock are always expos'd by Inch of Candle,

set up at low Rates, where every Person is admitted to Buy: But if it's meant Buying in
 India, 
it is clearly the Interest of
 England 
it should be so; for by this means, the Commodities of
 England 
are Ad∣vanced, and those of
 India 
bought at lower Rates, so as not only to supply
 England 
much cheaper, but al∣so the Foreign Markets as Cheap as their Neighbours.
 To which I Reply, That if the Company are the only Sellers of 
East-India
 Goods in 
England,
 they will, or may, have of us what price they please, by bringing home fewer than the Nation would expend, and feeding of it with no more than will yield them their own Rates; as the 
Dutch
 do with their Spices, which cost them but little more than Pepper, yet they Sell them at this Extravagant Price by publick Sale, to the highest Bidder; as is the Practice with us by the Candle.


If they are the Buyers of our English Commo∣dities; a Joint Stock must buy in Common with others; but they have a very great advantage over the Sellers, which I will clear by this in∣stance: Supposing 30000 long Cloaths are made in 
England,
 20000 or more of them are bought up for the 
European
 Markets, the Remaining must either be Sold for 
India,
 or lie on the Clo∣thiers Hands. This latter the Clothiers cannot suffer, and carry on their Trades, and Employ their People, so they must Sell to this one Buyer for 
India
 at his own Rates; but if there were 30 or 40 Buyers, instead of this single one, in a Joint Stock, it is reasonable to believe, the Sel∣lers would obtain both better Prices and Pay∣ments.




As for a Joynt-Stock's buying of Goods in 
India,
 upon the same advantage they do our Goods in 
England,
 it seems to differ extreamly; because in 
England,
 our Manufactors make their Goods for a general Market, not knowing before-hand to whom, or for what Trade they shall sell them. Whereas in 
India
 they do not make Goods for an uncertain Market, but the 
European
 Buyers there do Contract with the 
Indian
 Merchants for the quantity, quality, and prizes of the Goods they want, and allowed time for their making, and delivery. By which means the 
Indians
 are not at the mercy of a Joynt-Stock for their Commodities; for if the 
Europeans
 will not give them their prices, they will not make them the Goods they want.


Indeed, a Joynt-Stock may carry to 
India
 a few 
English
 Goods, and impose their own Pri∣ces on them, making them too dear for the 
Indians;
 but if many Persons carry our Manu∣factures thither, they must sell them cheaper, to introduce the general use of them: And tho' the Merchant, by enlarging Exportation and the Importation, should make the less profit, yet it's most evident the Nation will get the more. Besides, the Companies Argument will hold as well for all the Trades in 
Europe,
 as that of 
India;
 and then we must have but one Buyer and one Seller for each Country.


Their Third Answer is, 
That the Years
 1654, 1655, 1656. 
have given us a Chargeable Experi∣ment; that opening the
 India 
Trade is not the means to regain it from the
 Dutch; 
for there

were divers Considerable Merchants that did then break in upon that Joynt Stock by way of Interlo∣ping; who having continued that way of Trade for three or four years, found themselves so over∣matched by the Ʋnited Joynt Stock of the
 Dutch, 
and imposed upon by the Natives in
 India, 
in the point of Buying and Selling, that they themselves, who had formerly broke in as aforesaid upon that Company, were the Persons that first applied to
 Oliver Cromwell 
for Establishing a Joynt Stock, in order to regain the said Trade, and were the Persons that first Subscribed the same. By which means the Trade was regained to the Nation, when it was nigh lost.


And they also say, it's so far from obviating the inconveniencies of the
 Scotch 
Act, that this Nation will not only find by them (as now consti∣tuted in a Joynt Stock) the like Inconveniencies they found from the
 Dutch, 
but rather greater, by the nearness of their Neighbourhood. Nor can any Nation cope, as to the
 East-India 
Trade, with others, unless Established in a like Joynt Stock, supported with the like Priviledges and Immunities,
 &c.


To this I say, That the 
Dutch
 in those years of open Trade sunk greatly in their Stock and Credit; by reason we then Imported great quantities of the 
East-India
 Commodities, and undersold them, whereby the Trade was enlarged, and the Nation enriched, though the Adventurers made the less profit.


This indeed might cause our then Merchants, for their own private interest, and not for the general good, to imbibe the 
Dutch
 Notion of

entring into a Joynt Stock (for that Company was then apprehensive they should lose their Trade, if we did continue to keep ours open and free to all) and therefore our Merchants were induced to make their applications to 
Oliver Cromwell
 to ex∣clude their fellow Subjects from this Trade, be∣cause then they had the prospect of getting as much by one Hundred Pound Stock, as in open Trade by three Hundred.


And since the Merchants of 
England
 could do so much in their Infancy, when they Traded loose, and had nothing like the Experience and Stock they at present have, what will they not be able now to do, after their Skill, Experi∣ence, and Stock is more than trebled, and they Trade in a Regulated Company, which can do all things for the defence and preser∣vation of their Trade, as well as a Company with a Joynt Stock, and improve it abundantly more, with a far less Charge. For the Com∣pany cannot pretend to oppose the 
Dutch
 in 
In∣dia
 in time of War, and in Peace it must be our Treaties and Strength at home, that must secure us against any of their Insults abroad. And if the Natives impose any hardship upon us, it will not be our wisdom to make War upon them, as the Company rashly did, but procure the removal of them by means of an Ambassador, by Consuls, and the usual Pre∣sents: For the 
Indians
 are Men of that Sense and Morality, that where they meet with ho∣nest and fair Dealing, there is no fear of their displeasure. And at worst, our Merchants will

have the same security in all the 
Mogull
's Ports, as the present Company have at 
Suratt,
 and in the 
Bay,
 where they have no Forts, yet drive their Chiefest Trades, and trust the Natives with their Mony before hand.


And if all 
English-Men
 have the freedom of Trade to 
India,
 it cannot be supposed any of them will joyn with the 
Scotch,
 but every one will rather imploy his own Mony, if he be a Mer∣chant; and if of any other Condition, intrust it with his own Countrymen, whom he can rea∣dily call to an account for what he shall so commit to his trust.


Now if all the 
English
 decline the 
Scotch
 Company, they will want both Stock and Expe∣rience to carry it on, and will sink of themselves.


Their Fourth Answer is, 
That all Persons may at any time hereafter come into the Trade; for, notwithstanding upwards of seven Hundred New Adventurers came into their Joynt Stock upon their last Subscription in
 1693. 
yet there hath been each year since great alterations of other New Adventurers. And it cannot be denied, but the
 Scotch 
will change its Owners, as People have oc∣casion to Sell, or Buy.


To this I Reply, That any Man may Buy a Stock, if he will give them their Price, which may be treble the intrinsick value of all the Companie hath, were it sold, and divided. But, say they, every thing is worth what it's bought and sold for, which may be so in the opinion of the Buyer; but what losses have arisen thereby? the Copper, the Salt-Petre, the Linnen, and many other Stocks, are suf∣ficient

Testimonies, which have been raised by the same Arts used to mount the 
East-India
 Stock upon many occasions, to the enriching the Great Men of it, and to the ruine of many Families.


But a Man cannot always come into that Joynt Stock, nor any other on the same Terms with the first Subscribers. For instance, the present is now Sold at 60 
per Cent.
 and up∣wards (although according to its intrinsick value it's not worth 20.) Now suppose the said Company should to morrow be Establish∣ed by Act of Parliament Exclusive to others, no Person of what Degree soever, could Buy a Share in their Stock the same night, under one Hundred Pounds, and perhaps not under one Hundred and Fifty; and yet they would then have no more Riches than they have now.


By this it appears, that what pother soever they make about the Nobility, Gentry, Cler∣gy, Widows, and Orphans, none can come into that Trade, if in a Joynt Stock, but upon great disadvantages, except those that are now actually concerned in it, or shall upon opening the Books Subscribe to it. Whereas, were the Trade open to all, in a Regulated Company, every Ship being in the nature of a Joynt Stock, all sorts of Persons might at any time, when they can spare Money, or as they come of Age, be Interested in it upon the same Terms with any whatever.




Having now done with their Answers, I pro∣ceed to their Reasons.


1st. 
It hath been found by common Experience, That all Nations who have had a desire to procure to themselves a Trade to
 India, 
have made Ʋse of E∣stablishing a Joint Stock, for the gaining thereof, and upon Tryal have found all other means ineffectual, and therefore have continued the same; and certainly the most proper means to preserve a Trade, is the same by which it was at first acquired: And this was the Reason why the
 Scotch 
have chose this Method, rather then a Regulated Company.
 To which I plain∣ly Answer, That the main of this Reason is un∣true in fact, and in the Conclusson; for the 
Dutch
 did not procurre the Trade to themselves by E∣stablishing a Joint Stock; nor did they try any other means to find them ineffectual. But they obtain'd the Trade by a kind of War, the States Encouraging their Merchants by private Com∣missions, to look into those Seas,

 that they might bring down the Power of 
Spain
 (which then had that sole Trade) in which they obtained wonderful Success, as is at large set down in a Paper Printed the other day, to which I refer you) and partly by War, and partly by Trade, became so great, that they were in a manner another Common-Wealth; after which, they were Established as they have since continued: Now should the 
Dutch
 have kept on a perpetual War, to have preserved their Trade, they would most certainly have found the contrary Conse∣quence, and have lost it, as our present Company hath done: And this Assertion is equally Ridi∣culous,

as to perswade a grown Person to be held by Leading-strings, because he had by those first learnt to go.


I flatter my self, that all unbyassed Men will naturally Conclude, that were this Trade a 
Mystery,
 the Masters and first Discoverers of that Mystery, they ought to Enjoy it only but fourteen Years, as the Law hath provided. But that Time once expired, and the 
Mystery
 sufficient∣ly made known; used and practised by many Numbers of their fellow Subjects, whose Right it is become, will any Man in his Senses de∣clare, that the only way to Improve and En∣large their Art or Invention, is to appropriate the Use of it to those Persons only for ever, who first acquired it.


But the present Company have not been the first Discoverers of this Trade, and yet have En∣joyed it above Forty Years.


Nor is that Assertion true, That the 
Scotch
 for that very Reason chose a Joint Stock; for they have had no Experience of that Trade, the pra∣ctical part is still a Mystery to them; and they want Estates to undertake it: These are most probably the Reasons why the 
Scotch
 Parliament accepted the Proposals of a Joint Stock; though I am apt to believe that the Projector's chief Design was the hopes of Gain by Stock∣jobbing.


2d. Reason, 
That in case of any Difference between the Traders and the
 Indians, 
the strength a Joint Stock will Maintain in
 India, 
will enable them better to preserve their Factories, and oblige the
 Indians 
to do them Justice.




3dly. 
That in case of any difference or dispute with any
 European 
Nation in
 India, 
such Joint Stocks will be best able to preserve their Trade.


4thly. 
That it's very well known, the People of
 In∣dia, 
how Moral soever said to be, yet their Forms of Go∣vernment do not admit those open Ways to Justice, practised in
 Europe; 
wherefore the double Argu∣ments of Force and Money to bribe the Government, must be always ready, otherwise upon every little Di∣spute, they will over-run and seize the Persons and Effects, of any Regulated or open Trader, which will always be fomented by the Joint Stocks of other
 Eu∣ropean 
Nations.


To which three together I Answer. Brave and Boldly said, and had our Company as much Conscience as they have Confidence to assert a∣ny thing makes for them, whether Right or Wrong, they were worthy of a Mark of Di∣stinction: Themselves know that the two Ships, the 
Seamore
 and the 
Henry
 were admitted to Trade in 
India,
 and kindly used in the 
Mogul
's Dominions, although their Factors, by the Com∣pany's own positive Orders, accused them as Py∣rates, and Prosecuted them as such very Indu∣striously, I may say, Unnaturally insinuated the Belief thereof into them, because they knew there could not be a more provoking Crime for those People to punish, by reason of their vast Losses they had sustained from Pyracy; and yet neither their Persons nor Effects were seized and detain'd, after they were undeceived; but on the contrary, preserved and well u∣sed. And in Case of any difference that may

arise between us and the 
Indians,
 or 
Europe∣ans
 in 
India,
 a Regulated Company can by the Prudence and Honesty of their Factors, Commanders of Ships, and by Presents to the 
Indian
 Governours, by an Embassadour at the 
Mogul
's Court, and Consuls, 
&c.
 work the same, nay better effect upon them, than this pre∣sent Company; whose Forts and Castles are to very little, if any purpose at all, on such occa∣sions. Our Honest and Just Dealing can only secure us amongst them; and our Wooden Castles and Powers at Home can alone Protect us from the Affronts and Injuries of 
Europeans
 a∣broad. So I enter upon their Fifth Reason.


That in case of any considerable Loss or want of Profit in the Trade, a Joint Stock must still struggle with it; their whole Stock being apporpriated for the Trade: whereas in a Regulated Company, or open Trade, every Man Trades as he pleases, and Disconti∣nues when he will; such will Trade no longer than he finds the same to answer his Expectation, but will quit it upon the least Discouragement.


To which I reply, This might have some In∣fluence, could they give the World an Instance where a profitable Trade (as we count this to 
India,
 in which is such diversity) hath been de∣clined by the People of 
England,
 who are so far from leaving it upon the least Discouragement. That I know no Trade (though it hath been carried on to loss for many Years successively, but it hath been not only maintained, but con∣tinued to be overdone. Witness formerly the

Newfound-Land, Mallaga, Virginia,
 and at present the 
Jamaica, Barbadoes, Leward-Island Trades,
 none of these have been starved or neglected, notwith∣standing the incredible losses and disappointments many of those Merchants have sustained. We want only scope and liberty to employ our industry and our Stocks against the 
Dutch,
 or any other Competitors. And might this Nation but ob∣tain so great a Blessing, as to have this Trade open to them all in general, it would soon ap∣pear, that as well in this, as in all other Trades, where the 
Dutch
 have a Company with a Joynt Stock, and we are left free, we shall greatly reduce their Trades, and enlarge ours.


6. 
Whereas Joynt-Stocks have at a very vast Expence obtained many great Priviledges and Im∣munities from the
 Indians, 
as Coyning of Money, Trading Custom-free, and many others; which, if a Regulated Company, or open Trade be introduced, will be utterly lost.


This, as all the rest, is but a specious pre∣tence; for whatever that of Coyning of Money may be, by which they can have no advantage, the impression they give adding nothing to its value; all the other Priviledges they have,

 were obtained, not by this Company, but by others, and for the benefit of the 
English
 Nation; and so run all their 
Phirmaunds.
 And every private Ship that hitherto Traded in 
India,
 hath had the advantages thereof.


7. 
It's very well known, that in the Year
 1602. 
the
 Dutch 
seeing the Errors of a losing Trade to
 In∣dia, 
did after some years Experience, reduce the

whole into one Ʋnited Joynt Stock, with such Pri∣viledges as they have enjoyed ever since; which hath carried that Trade to the heighth it now is. And it cannot be denied, but the genius of Trade hath ap∣peared there in its utmost strength. And it is to be feared, unless the like Methods be pursued in this Nation, the
 East-India 
Trade will pass to some other Country; Trade always taking its Course where it finds the best treatment, and is allowed the greatest Advantages.


8. 
But admitting a Regulated Trade might struggle with some difficulties, yet in case of any Breach between the
 English 
and
 Dutch, 
certainly the whole Trade will be lost, they being very strong in
 India 
in num∣bers of Subjects, and Fortifications, which have not on∣ly been got by their being brought to a Joint Stock, but are now maintained, and daily Improving, which a Regulated Company can never withstand.


And it is to be doubted, unless great Encouragement be given to a Joint Stock, they also will hardly be able, in such case to continue, and preserve the Trade to this Nation.


To these, having in part answered already, I shall only add, that our 
East-India
 Company, with their Joint Stock, have not in time of War been able by force to Resist the 
Dutch
 in the 
In∣dies;
 and if you will believe the Letters from their own Chiefs and Consuls from thence,

 there is no manner of appearance that they ever will; and the 
Dutch East-India
 Company, who have many Fortifications, never Erected any for such a purpose; they know how pernicious War is, to any that are setled in a profitable Trade, in a potent Prince's Country.




But their Forts are to oppress the Inhabitants of the Spice and Pepper Islands, and force them to Trade with themselves only, upon their own Terms; which yet turns to small Accompt, as appears by their Inconsiderable Dividents (of 5 and 6. 
per Cent. per An.
 on the value of their Stock) in regard of their many Rich Ships Year∣ly brought home by them of late: Such is their vast Charge of maintaining a Trade by Force, That were the same set open to all the Subjects of 
England
 in a Regulated Company; without being clogg'd with that unnecessary Expence; it would soon appear, that when the 
English
 gain 30 to 40 
per Cent.
 (which is a sufficient Encou∣ragement in times of Peace, to extend that Trade to the utmost) the 
Dutch East-India
 Com∣pany must be reduced; for nothing can so much bring down their Elevated Company, and dis∣courage any other Nation to fall into that Trade, than to Import the 
East-India
 Commodities in great quantities, and sell them Cheaper in our Markets; so that if the whole Subsidie upon 
East-India
 Goods Exported, were drawn back, as the whole Additional Duty, and half the Subsidie now is; there needs, in my Opinion, no other Encouragement (befides that) to be given to that Trade.


But if the Parliament shall, after all, think fit to Establish the Trade to 
India
 in a Joynt-Stock, it may be hoped they will not Establish this pre∣sent Company, who have not merited so di∣stinguishing a Favour; but take care to pre∣serve the Right of the Subject; that all, of what
