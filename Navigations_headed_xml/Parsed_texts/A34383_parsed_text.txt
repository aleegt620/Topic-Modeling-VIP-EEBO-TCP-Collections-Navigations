SIR,


M
Y last to you was of the 10th. of 
November
 past, (which, in regard we have had much Westerly Winds since) I hope ere this time you have re∣ceived; according to the best Information I had or could procure, I made bold to acquaint you with sundry Passages, that before the date there∣of, came to pass amongst us: I also sent you two of our Orders in Print by Order of the Council here; The one for the Confinement of our 
Neetop
 (i. e. 
Friend)
 Indians, the other for a general Fast throughout this Col∣lony: By the one you may see the great Care our Authority hath, as well to make a distinction visible, betwixt our Friends the Christian 
Indians,
 and our Enemies the Heathens, as also, to secure the one from injuries, and to lay the other open, and make them liable to the hand of Justice: By the other you may see what sence of the immediate hand of God upon us our Magistrates have; and truly 
Sir,
 we have great cause to bless the Lord for that we have such Magistrates and Councellers that we are so well assured do aime at the Glory of God, and the peace and welfare of his people in this Wilderness; that however the mighty hand of God is lifted up upon us, and he hath given Commission to the Sword to destroy, yet we are well sa∣tisfied there is nothing wanting that lyeth within the reach of their wisdom or strength: Wherefore in the midst of our troubles we comfort our selves in this, that we are satisfied they do what in them lyeth: I hope in some short time I may hear of your receipt thereof.


Sir,
 In my last I also gave you (at first) an Account of the Reasons of the Rise and Origin of these unhappy Wars, in which, my Information was not so perfect, but that there was somewhat amiss; although, at that time, the Account thereof was generally receiv'd, and the alteration is not much, only in some few particular circumstances: Wherefore, that you might be the

 more certain thereof, I shall give you an account wherein I missed, Thus: About six years since one 
Sosoman,
 (an 
Indian
-Schollar and Minister) having spent some years in the Study of Divinity, being by that time judged capable of Preaching the Gospel, was by the Authority of 
Plymouth
 sent to Preach to King 
Philip;
 he with some seeming-kind of Devotion, heard him for a while at several times; and however his Zeal was in outward appearance, yet all that time, and a good while before, he, with several of his own men, had a Conspiracy to cut off the 
English
 thereabouts, and scrupled not to make the business known to 
Sosoman,
 as supposing he might be of great use to him, in the car∣rying on that bloody design; whereupon this 
Sosoman
 soon after makes this thing known to the Governor of 
New-Plymouth-Collony, Josiah Winslow
 Esq; King 
Philip
 suspecting he either would divulge, or had already made known this secret to the 
English,
 took Councel to kill this 
Sosoman;
 where∣fore in order thereunto, one day, as he sat fishing by a River-side, two or three 
Indians
 came and barbarously Murthered him in the place; where∣upon, as soon as the Governor and Councel of 
Plymouth
 heard thereof, sent and took the said Murtherers; as also a small Party went to King 
Philip
 and brought him and most of his chief men to 
Plymouth,
 and there Examined them, and had several meetings in Consultation about the business; but King 
Philip
 behaved himself very uncivilly (like a Heathen,) however due proof could not be produced against him, and he nor his Men not having yet shed any English Blood after his entring into a League of Peace with the 
English,
 was dismist; only the Murtherers after a legal Condemnation were Hanged. Here lies the occasion of our present difference, which I have made bold to acquaint you of.


Sir,
 Towards the close of my last to you, I gave you an Account of what was done at 
Hatfield
 the 19th. of 
Octob.
 last; in which Fight the Heathens were so put to it, that they were forced to go to their last refuge, that is, the 
Narragansets,
 who I wrote you, word we feared every day more and more would prove perfidious to us; wherefore the Authority of the United Collonies having Intelligence that King 
Philip
 with his whole retinue, as well Women and Children, 
&c.
 did harbor themselves under the pro∣tection of 
Ninicroft,
 who is the King of the 
Narragansets,
 as also hearing that that same 
Sachem,
 that came to 
Boston
 about the end of 
September
 last, (being 
Ninicroft
's Eldest Son) is since Marryed to the 
Squaw Sachem;
 which Marriage doth signifie a near Alliance: and also seeing that what that 
Sa∣chem
 did agree unto with our Authority, when in 
Boston,
 is not at all regard∣ed by them, (for that 
Sachem
 sent word when he came home into his own Country, that 
Ninicroft
 would not agree to what he had done:) these things so falling out near the same time, put our Authority then in Coun∣cel upon some necessity of finding out a speedy way to remedy the same. But notwithstanding their perfideousness hitherto, yet about three weeks after, five 
Sachems
 came together from 
Ninicroft
 to 
Boston,
 and engaged that our Enemies, entertained by them, should be delivered up instantly; but nothing being done of what they promised, the Commissioners of the United Collonies, sitting in Councel here, (the several consid erations here exprest, with others moveing them thereto) in the first place published this following Remonstrance (here inserted 
verbatim)
 and ordered a Body of Souldiers,

 Horse and Foot to march hence; in order thereunto, on the 10th. of this Instant 
December,
 six Companies of Foot and Horse marched hence un∣to 
Seaconck:
 The number of the Souldiers were thus; Of 
Massachusetts
 and 
Plimouth
 Collonies 700. Foot and 200. Horse, and 
Connecticot
 Collony having 300. Foot and 100. Horse ready to meet them at 
New London,
 whereof Governour 
Josiah. Winslow
 is gone out General: From 
Massachusetts
 Collony is gone out in Command, Major 
Appleton
 of 
Ipswich,
 Captain 
James Oliver,
 Captain 
Samuel Moseley,
 and Capt. 
Nath. Davenport
 of 
Boston,
 Capt. 
Johnson
 of 
Roxbury,
 Capt. 
Gardner
 of 
Salem,
 and Capt. 
Tho∣mas Prentice,
 Capt. of the Horse. These were Commanders of those seven Companies that marched hence. The 16th. Instant we had advice from them, that the Enemy had burnt Mr. 
Jeremiah Balls
 House at 
Narragan∣sett,
 and killed 18. Men, Women, and Children that were in it, and that they had taken 55. 
Indians,
 and killed 10. more, and burnt 150. Wigwams with the loss of four of our Men, and as many wounded. This exploit was performed by Capt. 
Prentice,
 a Capt. of the Horse.


The weather now being extream cold, having, both Frost and Snow in most places two foot, in many places three foot deep, we have as yet had nothing like to a Field Battel with the 
Indians,
 save that Fight we had at 
Hatfield,
 of which I gave you an Account of in my last, until these Soul∣diers went out last; since which time, by several Posts coming daily thence, as also by private Letters, I have this Account of this Fight in particular.


On 
Saturday
 the 19th. Instant, the General Mustered up the whole Ar∣my in 
November,
 as before, having with them three Ministers, 
viz.
 Mr. 
Dudley,
 Mr. 
Buckley,
 and Mr. 
Samuel Nowel,
 at Capt. 
Smiths
 House, (the same Capt. 
Smith
 I told you in my last, that came to 
Boston
 with 
Ninnicroft
's Eldest Son a 
Sachem)
 whose dwelling is about four miles off the 
Narragansetts
 dwellings, and is now the strongest Garrison in those parts) and having given orders for a march, according to discretion, marched to∣wards the 
Narragansets
 Country (or Town) where finding no 
Indians,
 they were at a stand, not knowing which way to go in pursuit of the 
Indians;
 but however during their stay, their Capt. 
Prentice,
 with his Company disco∣vered some place under ground, wherein was Indian-Corn laid up in store by them; this encouraged them to look farther; whereupon in their search they found several good quantities of that grain in like manner, which after∣wards was conveyed to the Garrison. In the Afternoon of that 
Saturday,
 some of the Souldiers accidentally espied an 
Indian
 alone, whom they took and carried to the General, who upon his refusal to answer to those questions demanded, was ordered to be Hanged forthwith; whereupon the 
Indian
 to save his life, told them where the whole body of the 
Indians
 were together, as well King 
Philip,
 and all other Confederate 
Sagamores
 and 
Sachems
 with their whole retinue, as also the whole body of the 
Narragansets,
 being joyned all in a body in 
November,
 about 4500. 
Indian
 men, besides Wives and Children: Whereupon, keeping this 
Indian
 for their Guide, they having provisions with them, marched all night, the 
Indians
 being then 16. Miles distant from them, and that Night there fell a very hard Snow two or three foot deep, and with-all an extream hard Frost, so that some of our Men were frozen in their hands and feet, and thereby disabled for Service:

 The next day, about Noon, they come to a large Swamp, which by rea∣son of the Frost all the Night before, they were capable of going over (which else they could not have done) they forthwith in one body entered the said Swamp, and in the midst thereof was a piece of firm Land, of about three or four Acres of ground, whereon the 
Indians
 had built a kind of a Fort, being Palisado'd round, and within that a clay Wall, as also felled down a∣bundance of Trees to lay quite round the said Fort, but they had not quite finished the said work: The General placed Capt. 
Moseley
 in the Front, to enter the Fort, and the rest of the Companies were placed according to dis∣cretion: In their march they met with three 
Indians
 sent out as Scouts, whom they shot dead at sight thereof: as soon as ever the 
Indians
 saw our Army comeing, they shot as fast as ever they could, and so our Men did the like. Before our Men could come up to take possession of the Fort, the 
In∣dians
 had shot three Bullets through Capt. 
Davenport,
 whereupon he bled extreamly, and immediatly called for his Lieutenant, Mr. 
Edward Ting,
 and commited the charge of the Company to him, and desired him to take care of his Gun, and deliver it according to order, and immediatly died in the place; his Company were extreamly grieved at his death, in regard he was so courteous to them; for he being Commander of that Company, be∣longing to 
Cambridge
 and 
Watertown,
 &c. was a Stranger to most of them; and at the time that he came to take possession of his Company, he made a very civil speech to them, and also gave them free liberty to choose their Serjeants themselves, which pleased them very well, and accordingly did so; and it is very probable the 
Indians
 might think that Capt. 
Davenport
 was the General, because he had a very good Buff Suit on at that time, and therefore might shoot at him.


In a short time our Forces entred the Fort, Captain 
Moseley
 being in the Front, the 
Indians
 knowing him very well, many directed their shot to him, as he afterwards told the General that he believed he saw 50. aim at him: As soon as he and they had entred the Fort, he espied a heap of above 50. 
Indians
 lay dead in a corner, which the 
Indians
 had gathered together; as soon as ever our Men had entred the Fort, the 
Indians
 fled, our men killed many of them, as also of their Wives and Children, amongst which, an Indian Black-Smith (the only man amongst them) that fitted their Guns and Arrow-heads; and amongst many more Houses burnt his, as also demolished his Forge, and carried away his Tools; they fought with the 
Indians,
 and pursued them so long as was advantagious to them; then the General gave order to sound a Retreat, which was done according to order. The Retreat was no sooner beaten, and the Souldiers were in a Marching posture, before they were got all out of the Fort, a thousand fresh 
Indians
 set on our Men, but in an hours time the 
Indians
 were forced to Retreat and Flie: Our Men, as near as they can judge, may have killed about 600. Indian Men, besides Women and Children: Many more 
Indians
 were killed which we could have no account of, by reason that they would carry away as many dead 
Indians
 as they could. Our men be∣fore they had been set on by the fresh 
Indians,
 had set fire to most of the Waggons in and about the Fort (which were near 1000. in all,) how ma∣ny

 were burnt down they could not tell positively, only thus; That they Marched above three miles from the Fort by the light of the Fires. Here is an Account of the number of 
English
-men slain by the 
Indians
 in this Engagement.

We wanting good Accomodation for our Wounded men, our General ordered them to be removed to 
Road-Island,
 where they have good Quar∣ters provided, and care taken for their Recovery.


Ninegret
 the old 
Sachem
 of the 
Narragansets,
 hath lately, with a small Party of 
Indians
 separated himself from the rest of his People, disowning their Actions, and all that joyn with King 
Philip,
 and professes himself a true Friend to the 
English
 Interest.




It may not be amiss to acquaint you that the Night before the Fight was, and all that day, and the night after, there sell such an extraordinary Snow that the like hath not been known for many years; and in regard that we had no Post come from our Army for 4. or 5, days, many fears arose a∣mongst us that our men were lost either by the Enemy, or the Snow, which made many an heart-ake amongst us: But so it was, that which we feared would spoil us, did very much disable the Enemy; for we having burnt down almost all their Wigwams, as also all their Corn that we could find, they thereby have less shelter and less subsistence left them, which misery of theirs is much aggravated by that great Snow. The Fight being over, our men Retreated to Mr. 
Smith
's House, where the Noble General gave Order that the Wounded and Sick should first of all be cared for, which was done accordingly; and that they might have the better Accomodation in the House, the General himself lay in a Barn belonging to the said House. Care is now taken to raise a 1000. men more to attend the General, which will suddenly march; what the issue will be the Lord knows.


King 
Philip
 supposing that 
Hatfield,
 a Town on 
Conecticot
-River, was very thin of men; he drew together 7 or 800. of his 
Indians,
 among which they had several Horses, and suddenly entred the Town on the 19th. of 
October,
 1675. which after they had set on Fire in three places, they di∣vided themselves into two bodies, and began to act several Cruelties on the Inhabitants: The 
English
 by their dilligence soon quenched the fires; and making up a body of 200. men, most of which were newly come into the Town, they fell on the 
Indians
 with a great deal of fury, and after two hours Fight, compelled the 
Indians
 to leave the Town with more hast than they entred; the English having slain about 100. 
Indians,
 with very little loss to themselves, pursued the rest to the River-side, where many were drowned that could not swim to the farther side. After this Fight, 
Philip
 and his 
Indians
 fled to the 
Narragansets,
 which caused the Counsel of the 
Massachusets
 to publish in Print this Remonstrance before spoken of








To our Brethren and Friends, the Inhabitants of the Colony of the 
Massachusets.




Although you cannot be Ignorant, how studious this Govern∣ment hath been to preserve Peace in this Colony, and hath taken up and Compromised diverse Quarrels that have Risen between our Selves, our Neighbours, & the 
Indians;
 And thereby at several times prevented those Calamities wherewith we are now Pressed: Yet to satisfie you that the same Mind, and the same Endeavours are continued in the present Government, we have thought it necessary to let you understand the Rise and Progress of our present Troubles, with our endeavours to have prevented the same.




IN
 June 
last, we were Certified by our Friends and Confederates of
 Plimouth, 
that
 Philip 
the Sachem of
 Mount. Hope 
was in Arms, and had solicited all the
 Indians 
to joyn with him against the English; and withal, they desired our Assistance to Suppress him: which we by the Articles of Confederation could not deny, and therefore applied our selves to Raise some Force for their Assistance: but were stil desirous to pre∣vent a war with the
 Indians; 
and therefore upon a for∣mer Experience of a good Effect wrought upon the said
 Philip, 
we resolved to use the same means,
 viz. 
sending Messengers from hence to
 Philip 
to Treat with him, hoping of the like Issue, which upon the like case about four years since we by Gods good hand obtain∣ed. But our Messengers arriving at
 Swanzy, 
in their way towards Philip, found divers
 English 
Murthered on the Road, and were informed by the
 English 
there, of divers hostilities of the
 Indians, 
which rendred our


 
Design and their Negotiation hopeless: Vpon which they returned, & informed us as abovesaid. where∣upon our Forces began their march in Aid of our Friends at
 Plymouth; 
and having driven
 Philip 
from his Country, we being informed that the
 Narragansets 
harboured his women, and aided him with men, we ordered our Souldiers to march to
 Narraganset, 
in or∣der to keep them quiet, and prevent their succouring or harbouring the Enemy: where, after some delay, they were drawn to consent to our demands, promi∣sing neither to entertain nor assist our Enemies which they since confirmed in a Treaty with the Commissio∣ners of the Colonies; Further engaging that they would deliver all those of Philips party, that upon his Rout near
 Scatoneck, 
or since, were fled to them; but have failed in every particular.


You may also take notice, That before any of our Souldiers marched to
 Mount-Hope, 
we were very careful to understand the state of the
 Nipnet-Indians, 
to prevent Philips design, & secure those
 Indians, 
& therefore dispatched two Messengers well known to them, to certifie them of Philips motion & of our desire to keep amity & friendship with them, according to the Cove∣nants made with them long since, no ways Violated on our part. And by the said Messengers, received fair returns from the most of them, being in 10. or 12. Plan∣tations. Some of them pretended fear of us: For their further satisfaction (when our Forces were sent out against Philip) we to satisfie & secure them, sent them by
 Ephraim Curtice, 
a Declaration under the Publick Seal, that we had no design or intent to disturb them, or any other
 Indians 
that would remain in their Plan∣tations peaceably: which Message & Messenger was evilly treated by many of them then Assembled, & the Messenger much endangered by the younger men, and not with any satisfaction by their Sachems, as the Event shewed, though at that present more mode∣rately received.




Soon after this dispatch & before
 Philips 
flying from
 Pocasser, 
and march up towards the
 Nipnet 
Country, some of the said
 Nipnet-
Indians Assaulted & slew divers of our people at
 Mendam; 
whereupon Captain
 Hutchin∣son 
with a small Guard, was sent up to the said
 Nipnet-Indians, 
(if possible to keep them quiet) who arriving at
 Quabaog; 
whereabouts was a Randezvous of the
 Indians, 
and having sent to them, they promised to meet him in a certain place, whither he at the time repair∣ing, found not the Indians; and being incouraged by the English of
 Quabaog, 
that the Indians were peaceable,
 &c. 
he advanced forward towards the place of the
 Indians 
Randezvous to Treat them: But in the way, was by Ambuscado treacherously way-laid, by which himself, with several others were wounded and slain, the
 Eng∣lish 
of
 Quabaog 
immediatly Assaulted, and the Town, except one House, totally destroyed; at which time, as we understand,
 Philip 
also with his broken party came up to the said Indians, & upon the first, or immediately before the arrival of the Forces, we sent up for the Re∣lief of those of
 Quabaog, 
Philip and his whole crew re∣treated (as we then feared, and afterwards were in∣formed) towards
 Conecticot-
River, from whence Re∣cruiting himself with Ammunition from
 Albany, 
and with men, partly from the treacherous
 Indians 
about
 Hadly 
and
 Spring-field, 
to have prosecuted his first design to Ruine and destroy the
 English. 
And notwithstand∣ing all the opposition of our Forces, hath done much mischief and spoil; and since the Repulse he received at
 Hatfield, 
withdrew into the
 Nipnet. 
Country, and since that (as we understand) towards the
 Narragan∣sets, 
who we do conclude, have favoured, abetted, and assisted him therein; and by entertaining and harbouring our Enemies, have dealt falsly and perfi∣diously with us: whereby we find our selves necessa∣rily Ingaged, with the Consent, Advice and Assi∣stance of the rest of the Colonies, in a War with them,


 
as well as with 
Philip,
 unless they prevent the same by a timely Complyance and Performance, and Se∣curity for the future: for the managing and carrying on whereof, we hope for, and expect (as we have hi∣therto had) the Assistance of all his Majesties Sub∣jects of this Colony in their respective Capacities, in the just Defence of the Glory of God, the Honour, De∣fence & safety of our King, Country, and our Selves, from the Subtilty, Rage, and Treacherous Attempt of our Barbarous Enemies.

BOSTON In 
NEW-ENGLAND, February
 the 8th. 1675/6.


SIR,


MY last to you beared Date the 21st. of 
December,
 1675. wherein I gave you a true Account of the state of our Affairs in 
New-England,
 particularly of the Engagement of our Forces with the 
Indians
 on the 19th, of 
December,
 1675. and the number of the Slain and Wounded. I shall now continue my Intelligence according to your request, and my promise, and give you a true Account of all trans∣actions here (worth your information) since the foresaid 
19th.
 of 
De∣cember.


Our wounded men (thanks be to God) are most of them pretty well re∣covered, and only Captain 
Sealy
 is dead that I can hear of. By some Indian-Prisoners, lately taken, we are certainly informed that they had 355. men killed out-right, besides several burnt in their Waggons, with Women and Children, and 180. wounded, many of which are since dead, particularly 
Sachem Quanepins
 Brother, who was a man of great Com∣mand among the 
Indians.
 That Night the 
Indians
 left the place where the Fight was, and Retreated 5. miles farther into the Country. 
Ninecroft
 an old Sachem in that Country, who hath hitherto continued Neuter, and neither assisted the 
Indians
 nor us, sent some of his men the next day, and Buried the dead 
Indians,
 and as many of the 
English
 as were left behind dead.


On the 23. and 24th. of 
December,
 the 
Indians
 sent some Commissioners to our General to Treat of Peace, which they had no mind to conclude; but we soon perceived it was only to prevent our falling upon them, and to gain themselves more time to remove their Army and Provision twenty miles farther into the Country, to some Rocks where we could not get at them without great danger. Although our General knew this, he was desi∣rous to keep the Treaty on foot by reason the Forces of the Collony of

 
Connecticot
 had left our Army, and we at home to recruit, and those sup∣plies from 
Boston,
 that are daily expected, not being yet Arrived, our Army was not in a condition to make any new attempts on the Enemy; but had not the 
Connecticot
 Forces left our Army, we had hopes that we might have compelled the Enemy to yield to our mercy. During this time, our Forces foraged the Country, and brought in great quantities of Indian-Corn to the Army.


About the beginning of 
January,
 the Forces from 
Boston
 that were sent to Reinforce our Army arrived at 
Narraganset,
 where our Army then lay: the extream coldness of the Season had mightily incommended them in their march; they lost Eleaven of their Men on their march, that were frozen to death, and brought many others sick and disheartned with the ex∣tream coldness of the Season: they were joyfully received by the Army; and soon after them the Connecticot Forces came to the Army, having Re∣inforced their Companies with some fresh men, and brought with them 
Unkus
 an Old 
Sachem,
 who dwelt in the 
Connecticot
 jurisdiction; he brought with him some Companies of his own 
Indians
 to the assistance of the 
English.


The Winter being now broke up, and the Snow and Ice all gone, our Army consisting in all of 1600. men, began their March to the Rocks, where the 
Indians
 were fled for protection; but in their way, they had in∣telligence that 300. 
Indians
 had been at 
Patuxit,
 an English Plantation on the 
Narraganset
 Bay, where they had burnt Mr. 
Carpenters
 Corn and Hay, and all his Houses, except his dwelling House, which likewise they had set on fire, but it was again quenched by some 
English
 that were in it: They likewise drove away with them 180. Sheep, 50. head of large Cattle, and 15. Horses: Besides, they took much Cattel from young Mr. 
Harris,
 and killed a Negroe-Servant of his; and having done this mischief, returned home with their Booty.


Our Army being Arrived in 
Pumham
's Countlry, an 
Indian Sachem,
 we burnt his Town, and had a small Reincounter with some of his 
Indians,
 where we wounded his chief Captain 
Quaquash
 on the knee, and killed five of his Men, and had four of our 
Connecticot
 men wounded.


Our Scouts brought in Prisoner one 
Tift,
 a Renegadoe English man, who having received a deserved punishment from our General, deserted our Army, and fled to the Enemy, where he had good entertainment, and was again sent out by them with some of their Forces; he was shot in the Knee by our Scouts, and then taken before he could discharge his Musket, which was taken from him and found deep charged, and laden with Slugs: He was brought to our Army, and Tryed by a Counsel of War, where he pretended that he was taken Prisoner by the 
Indians,
 and by them com∣pelled to bear Arms in their Service; but this being proved to be false, he was Condemned to be Hanged and Quartered, which was accordingly done.


Our Army beat the 
Indians
 from the foresaid Rocks, and pursued them almost as far as 
Quabog,
 in which pursuit we killed about 60. or 70. of them, and found many of the Matts scattered in the way, with which they cover their Houses, which we suppose they could not carry with them by rea∣son

 of our close pursuit. Some Prisoners taken from them, inform us, that their body consists of 4000. whereof 1800. were Fighting Men, half of which wanted Arms, that they were in great want of Powder, and greater want of Provisions.


Provision growing scarce in our Army, and the Enemy having cleansed the Country of things that might tend to our Relief, our General resolved to pursue them no farther, but to hasten homewards, which accordingly was done with what speed we could; but the scarcity of Victuals daily en∣creasing, we were forced to kill several of our Horses for our Sustenance. Our General dismist the 
Connecticot
-Men, and sent them home the nearest way, and Old 
Unkus
 and his 
Indians
 along with them. They proved very faithful in our Service, and were well treated by us. Our General having left 60. men in Garrison at Mr. 
Smiths
 House, at 
Narraganset,
 where the Fight was on the 19th. of 
December,
 came home by the way of 
Malborough:
 Many of our Souldiers are troubled with the 
Flux,
 of which our General is one.


King 
Philip
 hath not yet been at 
Narraganset,
 as we feared; but is retired with his Men near 
Albany,
 where he hath kept his Winter Quarters. We very much fear the 
Indians
 falling on our Out-Towns this Spring, which if they should, would extreamly damnifie us.


Our Friend Mr. 
H. O.
 went out again into the Army, before he was cured of his old wound, and hath received another on his Elbow-joynt, which we fear will cause him to lose his Arm, if not his Life. Our Enemies are yet very Unmerciful, sparing no persons life that they can Master.


I see no likelihood of any Peace, but much fear our Wars are far from an end: Our Trade to 
Virginia
 is quite decayed, not one Vessel having gone from hence thither since the Wars began; but by a small Vessel Arrived here from thence, we are informed that the 
Indians
 have fallen unexpected on the 
English,
 and destroyed many of them, and done much harm with very little loss to themselves, but this report finds very little credit with us; by the next Shiping I shall (God willing) give you a farther Account of our Affairs, and in the mean time shall neglect no opportunity of informing my self of the transactions of these Parts, being sensible how much you have obliged


Your Friend to his Power, N. S.








POST-SCRIPT.


I Thought it needful to acquaint you that on the 21th. day of 
March,
 Anno. 1621. the 
English
 made a League of Peace with 
Massasoiet,
 who was Grand father to the present King 
Philip,
 on the following Terms and Conditions,


1. That neither he nor any of his should injure or do hurt to any of our people.


2. That if any of his did any harm to any of ours, that then he should send the Offender unto us for punishment.


3. That if any 
English
 took any Goods belonging to the said 
Massasoit,
 or any of his 
Indians,
 they should restore them again: and he obliged himself to do the like.


4. That if any of the Neighbours of the said 
Massasoiet
 should make war against him, the 
English
 should assist him: and he obliged himself to assist the English on the like occasion.


5. That he should inform his Neighbours and Confederates of these Co∣venants, that they might be careful of wronging either party.


6. That where any of his 
Indians
 came amongst the 
English,
 they should have no Bows or Arrows, or any other Arms with them.


7. That in so doing, our Soveraign Lord King 
James
 should esteem him as his Friend and Ally.


These Articles were agreed on to the good satisfaction and content of both Parties, and 
Massasoiet
 was content to become the Subject of our Soveraign Lord King 
James,
 his Heirs and Successors, and gave to the English all the Lands adjacent, and to their Heirs for ever.


On the 25th. day of 
September,
 in the year 1639. this great Sachem 
Massasoiet,
 with 
Moanam
 his Son, came personally to the Court held at 
Pli∣mouth
 in 
New-England,
 and desired that the League and Confederacy for∣merly made with the Government of 
Plimouth,
 might stand and remain in∣violable, and the said 
Massasoiet
 and his Son 
Moanam
 did faithfully promise to keep and observe the Covenants and Conditions therein expressed and contained; and that neither of them should needlesly or unjustly raise any quarrel, or do any wrong to other Natives, or provoke them to War against them; and that neither of them should give, sell, or convey any of their Lands, Territories, or Possessions whatsoever, to any person or persons whomsoever, without the privity and consent of the Government of 
Pli∣mouth:
 All which conditions the said 
Massasoiet
 and 
Moanam
 his Son, for themselves and their Successors, did then faithfully promise to observe and keep; and the whole Court, in the name of the whole Government for each Town respectively, did then ratifie and confirm the aforesaid ancient League and Consederacy; and also did further promise to the said 
Massasoiet


 and to 
Moanam
 his Son, that they shall and will from time to time defend them and their Successors when need and occasion shall require, against all such as shall rise up against them, to wrong or oppress them unjustly.


Anno.
 1662. There being occasion of some suspition of a Plot intended by the 
Indians
 against the English; 
Philip;
 the Son of the aforesaid 
Moanam,
 and Grandson of 
Massasoiet,
 and now the implacable Enemy of the English, made his personal appearance at the Court held at 
Plimouth,
 August the 6th. and did there earnestly desire the continuance of that amity and friendship that had formerly been between the Governours of 
Plimouth
 and his De∣ceased Father and Grand-father; and for that end the said 
Philip
 doth for himself and his Successors, desire that they might for ever remain subject to the King of England, his Heirs and Successors; and doth faithfully promise and engage that he and his will truly and exactly observe and keep inviolable such conditions as have formerly been by his Predecessors made; and par∣ticularly, that he will not at any time needlesly or unjustly provoke or raise war with any of the Natives, nor at any time give, sell, or any way dispose of any Lands to him or them appertaining; to any Strangers, or to any without our privity or appointment; but will in all things endeavour to carry it peaceably & inoffensively towards the English. And the said Court did then also express their willingness to continue with him and his the above∣said Friendship; and do on their part promise that they will afford them such friendly assistance by advice and otherwise, as they justly may; and we will require our 
English
 at all times to carry it friendly towards them: in witness whereof, the said 
Philip
 the Sachem hath set to his hand; as also his Unkle, and witnessed unto by sundry other of his chief men.

Likewise in the year 1621. several of the 
Indian
 Sachems, besides 
Massa∣soiet
 before-named, came unto the Government of New 
Plimouth,
 and ac∣knowledged themselves to be the Loyal Subjects of our Soveraign Lord King 
James,
 and subscribed unto a writing to that purpose with their own hands; the tenour of which said writing followeth, with their names annex∣ed thereunto, some judicious persons conceive it may be of use in succeeding Ages, if not in ours; I think it convenient here to insert it.

The Original Instruments signed with their own hands, and the chief of their men still remain on Record in the Register of the Court of 
New Pli∣mouth.






In the said year, 1621. the 
Narroganset Indians
 sent a Messenger to the Governour of 
Plimouth
 with a bundle of Arrows tyed together with a Snakes skin, which he understood was a threatning and a challenge. Upon which the Governour sent them this Answer; That if they loved War ra∣ther than Peace, they might begin when they would; he had done them no wrong, neither did he fear them, nor should they find him unprovided; and by another Messenger sent the Snakes skin back with Bullets in it, but they would not receive them, but sent them back again; but the 
Indians
 were better advised than to quarrel with the English at that time.








BARBADOES, Spickes-Bay, 
November
 the 30th. 1675.


MY last to you was an information of a bloody Tragedy intended a∣gainst his Majesties Subjects here in this Island, by the Heathen the Negroes, which was by the Providence of God miraculously discovered eight days before the intended Murder should have been acted: The manner of the discovery was thus; A Negroe man be∣longing to Mr. 
Hall
 Senior, being absented from his said Master, among se∣veral other Negroes who had a hand in the Plot: In a Councel among them, they did contrive that the Negroes belonging to each several Planta∣tion, should in the dead time of the Night fall on at the sound of the Allarm, which was to be given in one hour, and at several places through the Island, which Negroes so allotted was to kill their Master and Mistresses with their Overseers; this foresaid Negroe of Mr. 
Halls
 (though one of the chief Plotters) yet having a respect to his Master, would by no means consent to the killing of his Master, and upon refusal was much threatned; and being afraid of his Life, makes his escape and returns home; and one day, which was a little before the prosecution of the murder, was over-heard (telling the Plot to his Country-men) by a Negro Woman, who waited and attend∣ed on her Mistress, which the Negro Woman immediately reveals. The Negroe man being taken to examination, confest the whole truth, which was immediately told the Governour, who appointed some Captains to raise their Companies for depressing the Rebels, which accordingly was done, and abundance taken & apprehended, & since put to death, and the rest kept in a more stricter manner; yet 
Jethuran
 like, we have kicked a∣gainst God, and slighted the mercy of so great a deliverance. The man∣ner of their proceedings I wrote to your more at large; and as the Lord did deliver us from the Tyranny and barbarous cruelty of Savage Heathens, and we still remaining obstinate, & refusing to return to him by Repentance; the Lord hath taken us into his own hand to chastise us, which chastilements lyeth very heavy on the poorer sort, and none of the Rich excepted. Sir, upon the last day of 
August
 last, about six of the Clock in the Afternoon, there did arise a Violent Storm of Wind & Rain out of the North West, and continuing between the North and the South so violent, that before the hour of Twelve at Night, there was not twenty Houses standing in our Pa∣rish, in which there is above three hundred Families, and those that did stand, much damnified; our Neighbouring Parishes tasting of the same Cup. There is kill'd out-right (by the falling of Houses) in this Parish, thirty seven, and many more is since, with the violence of the wind and cold, dead, and many lying in their beds of sickness; and as to our Ships,

 all drove Ashore to pieces, except one of the Kings Men of War, which went to Sea, and returning next day after the Storm was ceased, did pro∣test to the Governour, that twenty Leagues off there was no Storm, for he carried his Top sail half Mass high. Our fellow-subjects in 
New-England,
 have the 28th. of the same month tasted of the same Cup, and was very hard put to it this last Summer by one King 
Philip
 an 
Indian
 King, who hath Re∣volted without cause given him by the 
English,
 neither will he shew any reason why; but being by an Embassador from the Governour of 
Boston,
 demanded why he would maintain the War, refused to Treat with the Em∣bassador, telling him, 
The Governour was but a Subject, and that he would not Treat except his Brother King
 Charles 
of
 England 
were there:
 There is abundance of Families destroyed, besides those kill'd in the War; but it is very much hoped this Winter they will be Routed; the reason is, because they have no Woods nor Bushes to shelter in, which is a great help to a Flying-Army, such as they are, for they will not bide any pitch Battel. Our Bre∣thren in 
Virginia
 had been hard put to it this last Summer, if it had not been for the Relief of 
New-England
 and 
New York,
 which makes it the harder with us here: pray God mend it.


By the tempestuous Wind, and the violent raging of the Sea, which hath much over-flowed our banks, and incroacht upon the Land, here are many Houses lost; among which mine was in number, where I saved no∣thing to cover us from the violence of the Storm but what was on our backs. Pray God that I may make a sanctified use of the Chastisement, because the Lord hath not given over our Life to Death. So having no more at present, but my Service to your self and good Lady, I rest


Your humble Servant, G. W.




I forbear to tell or to write to you of the strange Accidents, as the re∣moving of whole Frames, great timber Trees many yards from their proper stations, by the violence of the Storm; if I should, it would be counted Ridiculous, but I leave it to the Relation of others.


Wind-mills down in this Parish 16. much damnified 12. indeed none standing but stone mills in the Parish, but what must be pull'd down. Churches down 9. Such another blow will bring 
Barbadoes
 near the Horizon.
