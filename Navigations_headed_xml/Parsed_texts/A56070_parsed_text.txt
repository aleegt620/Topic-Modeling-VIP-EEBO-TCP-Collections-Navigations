A PROSPECT OF THE NAVY ROYAL.




WHile I, in pleasing Melancholly sat,


Reflecting on this Islands happy state;


When, from the top of an aspiring Tower,


I view'd at once, it's 
Beauty
 and it's 
Power;


Pleas'd to behold how safe we are from harm,


Embrac'd by 
Thetis
 kind, and Clasping arm:


Blest Isle said I, and full of Natures Pride,


So 
Beautiful
 and so well 
Fortifi'd;


At last my Unrestrained Senses strove


Farther, than Nature gave them strength, to rove:


My eyes a lavish freedom I allow'd,


Which nothing cou'd confine, but 
Sea,
 or 
Cloud,


Until, at length, where 
Skies,
 and 
VVaters
 met,


Where these did seem to 
Rise,
 and those to 
Set;


At first a 
Leafeless VVood
 began to appear,


But strait it 
Ʋndeceiv'd
 me, and 
drew near;


So that my wonder 
Ceas't,
 as it 
Begun,


And my 
Slow Thoughts
 were, by my 
Sight, Out-run;


Which soon presented to me such a Fleet,


Few
 Nations ever 
Saw,
 and 
None
 dare 
Meet.




A hundred 
Moving Castles
 floating came,


That seem'd the Winds to 
Calm,
 and Seas to 
Tame;


Each 
Swelling
 Sail the baffled storm 
Out-braves,


And makes the 
Ships
 look 
Prouder
 than the 
VVaves:


Now the 
Enlarged Oak,
 whose 
Fettered Foot,


Had many years, been 
Prisoner
 to it's 
Root,


Gratefully brings new 
Tributes,
 to that 
Earth,


Which gave it both it's 
Liberty,
 and 
Birth;


Ioyful in storms, remembring that it knew


More Danger,
 in 
Less Tempests,
 while it 
Grew:


And thanks the 
Axe,
 that did commit that 
Rape,


To 
Cut
 it 
Down,
 and 
Give't
 a 
Nobler
 shape.


These are the 
Arks,
 that save us from the 
Flood,


Which else might 
Overwhelm
 our Land with 
Blood:


These 
Guard
 our 
Prince
 from Villanies 
Fatal Stroke,


And every 
Man of VVar's
 a ROYAL OAKE.






The 
Grecian Horse,
 although it's womb contain'd


Heroick souls, whose courage was unstain'd,


Might long before the 
Trojan Walls
 have stay'd,


Had not the 
Enemy Themselves
 betray'd:


They first their own destruction did 
begin,


And 
Made a way,
 to 
Let
 their 
Ruine in:


But these 
Sea-Horses,
 by the 
English
 backt,


Do 
Truths,
 beyond those Grecian 
Fables
 act:


Our 
Moving Forts,
 with ease, themselves 
Transplant:


Proving the 
Castle,
 and the 
Elephant.


We make a way to be Victorious, where


Base 
Fraud
 did never in our glory share:




And fairly 
Conquer
 all we do oppose,


So we not only 
Beat,
 but 
VVin
 our Foes.






Mark now these 
Monarchs
 of the spacious 
Main,


Each seems 
Attended
 with a glorious 
Train:


The streaming Pendants dally with the Galis,


They in like manner court the prouder Sails:


Below,
 the steady 
Keels
 the Waves divide:


Aloft,
 the 
Masts
 display their wanton 
Pride:


Aboard,
 the Jocund 
Seamen
 pleasant are:


Yet, in the 
Midst
 of Mirth, 
Prepar'd
 for War.


They are not 
Tyr'd
 with a long tedious 
March,


Nor does the scorching 
Sun,
 their bodies 
Parch:


No 
Luggage,
 there, is to new quarters sent,


Their 
Tent
 do's 
Carry them,
 not they their 
Tent:


They weary not their 
Limbs
 by carrying Arms,


Nor in their 
Sleeps,
 disturb'd by 
Strange Alarms:


They're always 
Fit,
 always 
Prepar'd
 to fight,


And never 
See
 the 
Foe,
 but with delight.


Now Veiw the 
Royal Charles,
 before the rest,


Proud
 that they are with such a 
Leader
 blest,


Her 
Virgin-self
 she freely has resign'd,


To him that's grown the 
Terrour
 of 
Man-Kind;


The 
Matchless Prince,
 who, midst the powerful Foe,


Dares 
Doe,
 whatever she dares 
Ʋndergo:


Before his 
Own, Her Safety
 he'l 
Prefer,


And rather chuse to lose 
Himself
 than 
Her.






Have you observ'd at some great 
Monarchs
 Court,


Where People of 
All Qualities
 resort,




How they pay 
Homage,
 in their 
Several Sphears?


Knights
 do give place to 
Lords,
 and 
Lords
 to 
Peers:


But when they come before the Regal Throne,


No man is Honour'd but the King alone:


So here, we see all the well order'd Fleet,


With humble Flag, their Admiral do greet:


And seem with joyful shouts, and smiles to say,


"This is the
 Charles 
and
 Princes 
wedding day.






Old Poets feign, when 
Jason
 went from 
Greece,


Hoping to 
steal,
 not 
win,
 the 
Golden Fleece,


That the 
small ship,
 wherein he safely 
went,


As a 
gay Present,
 to the 
gods
 was sent:


But had the 
Actions
 of our 
Prince
 been told,


What 
Prizes
 he has 
w
n
 more rich than 
Gold:


How many 
VVaking Dragons
 he has 
slain,


He might be thought to 
merit
 what they 
Feign:


And having 
Finish'd
 the successful 
VVar,


His 
Charles
 might well deserve to be a 
Star:


So a new constelation should we gain,


If 
Rupert's Ship
 were joyn'd to 
Charles his VVain.






But see, amidst that Vast and 
Royal Town,


Others, that bears 
Alliance
 to the 
Crown:


The 
Soveraign
 and the 
Prince,
 two 
Sisters
 are,


Who've 
Lost
 their 
Maidenheads
 alreay there;


Ravish'd
 by 
Boors,
 whom they 
resisted
 so,


As in the strife, t' affectt their 
Overthrow:


And the 
Redoubled
 Honour, they brought thence,


Became at once their 
Praise
 and 
Recompence.








To reckon all your 
Hero's,
 that do fight


For the true 
Neptunes (Mighty Charles's)
 right:


To sing of all the 
Battails
 they have won,


Of what they have 
Endur'd
 and what they've 
Done,


Alas! what 
Pen,
 what 
Volumes
 would 
Suffice,


To 
write,
 what 
written,
 needs must pass for 
Lyes?


My 
Quill
 would undergo 
Cassandra's
 grief,


To utter 
Truths,
 and yet not gain belief:


I should all Poets 
Fictions
 farr out-doe,


Which, with my 
truths
 compar'd, would all seem 
true.






But stay—Methinks the Caverns of the Oak,


Send forth (like 
Aetna
) Sulpher, Fire, and Smoak:


Which, follow'd by a harmony of noys,


Seem to express the Seamen's doubled joys:


'Tis even so, the 
Mighty Prince
 appears,


And 
chases thence
 (already 
banish'd
) fears:


So, when the Ever youthful 
Prince
 of 
Light,


'Has well disclos'd, the 
Eyelids
 of the 
Night,


The 
Drooping
 Flowers erect their 
pensive-heads,


Shaking their 
Dew,
 upon their 
Earthly-beds:


And while he courts them 
all
 in 
Amorous Rays,


Each, greedy of a 
Kiss,
 her leaves 
displays:


Until they see th' espoused 
Heliotrope,


To whom they all 
resign
 their Widdow'd 
Hope:


Thus fares it with our 
Prince,
 each Frigate runs


To meet, and welcome him with 
Peals
 of 
Guns:


Cowards whose 
pond'rous Soul
 so 
low
 was 
sunk,


That they durst scarce exchange a 
cuff,
 though 
drunk;


Do neither fear the 
Dutch,
 the 
Rocks,
 nor 
Shelves,


For they are petty 
Princes,
 now themselves.


Toutcht with 
Magnetick
 vertue, every soul


Turns to the 
Prince,
 as to their 
Northern Pole:




Who 
Shines
 on all the Ships with 
equal
 light,


And none can 
Guess
 which is his 
Favourite:


Till caught at last by 
Charles's
 Nuptial 
Charms,


Briskly he runs into her 
Loyal Arms:


So that no 
hostile Stratagems,
 or 
Force,


Shall 
him
 from 
her,
 or 
her
 from 
him
 Divorce.






Thus did I please my 
Fancy,
 and my 
Sight,


The 
One
 with 
Wonder,
 th' 
Other
 with 
Delight;


Passing, in solitude, the short liv'd 
Hours,


While ev'ry 
Lust
 the 
Latter
 still 
Devours:


When 
Ten
 were 
Past,
 I scarcely thought'em 
One,


As if 
Old Time
 had for a 
Wager Run.


Till by, and by, the Sun Declin'd apace,


Seeming in 
Hast
 to 
Wash
 his 
Ruddy Face.


But, as he passes by our Navy, see


He 
bows
 his 
Head,
 and 
Once more Courts a Tree.






Go glorious Fleet, go on, and though 
black Night


Ha's 
Ravish'd
 thee from my unhappy 
Sight:


Yet, shall my eyes send forth a 
Briny Flood,


Whence I will 
Launch
 out 
Prayers
 for thy good:


A 
Gust
 of powerful sighs shall 
drive
 them on,


Their 
Haven
 shall be the 
Eternal Throne.


Where, if they e'r arrive, they'l humbly crave,


That in 
Just Wars
 thou 
Good Success
 may'st have.






May our Prince 
Finish
 what he do's 
begin,


May he 
Survive,
 the 
Battails
 he do's 
win:


Our 
Nations
 farther 
Safeguard
 may he be,


And may we Conquer both by 
Land
 and 
Sea:


May CHARLES our King his enemies defeat:


And ever be as 
Happy
 as he's 
Great.




FINIS.
