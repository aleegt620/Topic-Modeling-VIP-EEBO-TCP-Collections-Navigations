A Plain and Uninterested Reflection Upon the present CASE OF THE 
East-India COMPANY,
 Under its following Circumstances, 
Viz.


I. — OF having been established and supported by an Uninterrupted Series of 
Royal Charters
 of 
Incorporation,
 from Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and her Princely 
Successors,
 down to those of his present Majesty; from whom, and from her late Majesty Q. 
Mary
 of blessed Memory, it received Confirmation, by like 
Charters,
 in 
October
 and 
November,
 1693, for 21 Years then to come; Whereof more then 16 rest yet unexpired.


II. — Of having had, in Vertue of these their Majesties last 
Charters,
 few less than 800 New 
Adventurers,
 incorporated into it; but not without 740000 
l.
 first Subscribed, towards the enlarging of its 
Stock,
 and rendring the 
Trade
 of it, more extensive, and more beneficial to the Nation.


III. — Of having, notwithstanding these 
Grants,
 and though in manifest Diminution of their 
Rights
 thereby, and to the known prejudice of its 
Trade,
 submitted with all Alacrity, to a later 
Charter
 of 
Regulations
 in 1694, by which it is in particular made dissolvible upon its appearing to the King, 
not to be profitable to him, or this his Realm;
 but yet not till 
after
 three 
Years Warning first given it, under his Privy Seal or Sign Manual.


IV. — Of the Unspeakable 
Charge,
 it has undergone in Purchasing the 
Freehold
 of divers 
Forts, Factories, Buildings,
 and 
Lands
 in 
India,
 for the necessary Carrying on of its 
Trade;
 besides other immense Sums, in fortifying, building on, and Accommodating to its Service, the Islands of 
Bombay
 and St. 
Helena,
 both invested by the 
Crown
 in the said 
Company,
 as its perpetual 
Inheritance.


V. — Of its like extraordinary and Unavoidable Charge, in the Purchase and For∣tifying of its 
Forts
 on the 
West Coast
 of 
Sumatra,
 and 
Coast
 of 
Mallabar,
 for the preserva∣tion of its 
Pepper-Trade;
 as that without which, the same must have been exposed to an obvious hazard of being lost to the 
Nation.


VI. — Of its having (besides the 
Publick Benefits,
 otherwise arising from these its 
Expences,
 to the 
Nation
's 
Trade
 there) acquired to its self a 
Standing Income
 of 
Rents
 and other 
Duties,
 to more than 40000 
l. per Annum;
 and that Yearly encreasing.


VII.— Of having, besides its forementioned 740000 
l. Subscription-Mony,
 paid up∣wards of 85000 
l.
 to the 
Crown
 for its 
Stock,
 during the late 
War,
 over and above its Pro∣portion for the present Year; and 295000 
l.
 more for 
Customs,
 since the 
Date
 of that 
Subscription.


VIII. — Of its having, notwithstanding and besides all these 
Burthens
 and 
Payments,
 and particularly that of its 
Customs
 towards the security of its 
Trade;
 undergone within the five Years of its present 
Charter,
 the yet more heavy Calamity of losing 12 Ships, to the 
Value
 of above a 
Million
 of 
Pounds Sterling
 more.




IX. — Of having from these its losses, joyned to its other 
Charges,
 been necessitated (for preserving the Remainder of its Unhappy 
Stock,
 and supporting of its 
Trade
) not only to the making further 
Advances
 of its own, but taking up Considerable 
Sums
 elsewhere at 
Interest,
 for which both it and its said 
Stock,
 stand at this day answerable.


X. — Lastly; Of finding it self no sooner brought within View of enjoying its Share at least, with the rest of his 
Majesties Trading Subjects,
 in the benefits of 
PEACE;
 after so great an Over-proportion of Sufferings, from the Calamities of the 
WAR;
 but that, without the least Default assign'd for it on the part of the 
Company,
 or regard shewn to the Provision even in that Case made by his 
Majesty
 himself, in the three Years 
Warning: A Project
 has been concerted by Persons (
Merchants
 and 
Others
) not interest∣ed in the said 
Company,
 for the utter Supplanting it, and gaining to themselves, exclu∣sive of all Others, an immediate Propriety in its 
Trade
 by 
Act
 of 
Parliament;
 in plain Derogation of his 
Majesties Charters;
 to the manifest Oppression of the present 
Company,
 the much greater part of whose present 
Members,
 have not to this day (from the many forementioned 
Charges
 and 
Losses
) touched one 
Penny
 of clear 
Profit,
 from the day of their 
Subscription;
 and to the Obvious Ruin of Thousands of Others, interested with them in the same.


In which their so Unaccountable Enterprize, should these 
Gentlemen,
 by the Strength of what they have without any or at most with little Adventure, been gathering from the 
Publick,
 succeed; to the spoiling the 
Company,
 of the little which this 
Accumulation
 of Evils in the Service of the 
Publick
 has left it, of the 
Trade
 it has so dearly paid for the sole 
Title
 to: It seems worthy of every ingenuous Dealer's Reflection: 
Viz.






REFLECTION:


What degree of
 Oppression, Circumvention, 
or
 Violence 
to
 Publick Faith 
it can be thought to be; that these
 Gentlemen 
can ever pretend to find fault with: When (as none will now think it impossible) another
 Juncture 
may arise, wherein
 Themselves, 
under the best Securities either of
 Right 
or
 Merit, 
may be attacked with the same
 Irresistable Argument 
they now glory, in being able to over-bear the present
 Com∣pany 
with?

East-India
 Company.
