TO THE READER.


O
Ʋr Fathers remember one man that drew the whole body of the Heavens in a short Plate, which he presented to the Emperour of 
Germany;
 And another that Com∣prehended the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lords Prayer in one sin∣gle Peny, which he bestowed upon Queen 
Elizabeth.
 We their Posterity, have here, all that the Industrious Collection of 
Strabo, Pliny,
 and the Judicious Ob∣servations of 
Pomponius Mela,
 the choice Rarities of the 
Nubian
 Geogra∣phy, the deep and long Reaches of the Admired (
)
 
Ptolomy:
 the great In∣dustry of 
Gerard Mercator;
 the often translated Cosmography of 
Sebastian

 Munster;
 the worn-out 
German M. S.
 of 
Goldman;
 the stately pieces of 
Bleau,
 and 
Johnston;
 the comprehensive De∣scription of 
Lucas de Linda:
 the 
 of 
Ralph Volaterran;
 the Great World of Great 
Ortelius
 and 
Maginus;
 besides the Corographies of each Country,
 as 
Guicciardane
 of the 
Low Countries, Le∣anders
 of 
Italy, Cambden
 of 
England;
 The travels of the Experienced, as 
San∣dys, Blunt, L' Blance,
 the 
Holstein
 Am∣bassadors; all these sum'd up in 
24
 sheets, above an 
100
l
 worth of Learning for 
18
d
,
 & many ages knowledg of the whole world for a few hours study: It's strange though true, to consider that the Gentlemans cu∣riosity can pitch upon no Place, Custome, History of any part, or all the World, but here he hath satisfaction; the Traveller desires to know no Country, either for his Instruction in new Observation, or Recol∣lection of his old ones, but here it's fully

 described: The Seaman seeth here in one day, all Creeks, Sands, Ports, Channels, with the Longitude and Latitude of each place: The Merchant, all Commodities Imported and Exported into each Coun∣try, with the Marts for them; the time and place of trade for each of them; the Novilant hath the scituation of each place of action he hears of; the Schollar all the Governments, Laws, Alterations, Incli∣nations, Inhabitants, Cities, Laws and Customs of each Country. 
Cato
 used to ask upon the proposal of any business to be done, 
cui bono,
 to what end is this? And if thou ask, 
cui fini,
 to what purpose is the writing of this Book? We answer, 
1.
 It is to prepare the younger sort with an exact introduction to larger Geographies. 
2.
 It's to accommodate the more knowing with an exact account in the brief of their lar∣ger reading to help their memory. 
3.
 It's to render History more pleasant; for as the

 story maketh the place more remarkable, so the particular knowledge of the place ma∣keth the story more pleasant. 
Ammian Marcellinus
 hath deserved well of the Common-wealth of learning, by premising the Geography and Description of each part of the World, before he attempted the History of the whole. 
4.
 It's to render the Scripture in many places mentioned in it (out of 
Chytraeus,
 his 
Itinerarium S. Script.
 and 
Adricomius
 his 
Terra Sancta
) more intelligible. 
5.
 It's to fur∣nish Physitians with the necessary know∣ledge of the temper of mens bodies in eve∣ry Clime; the nature and growth of sim∣ples, and medicinal drugs in each Coun∣try; to acquaint Lawyers with the Laws of Nations, and Divines with the Reli∣gions of the World: To hint to States-men the Genius of all people; together with the Limits and Bounds the Weakness and Strength, Advantages and Disadvan∣tages

 of all States and Kingdoms. And 
Lastly,
 to entertain any Gentleman with∣out any charge or pain, with the particu∣lar draughts of Kingdomes, Provinces, Cities, Towns, Castles, Continents, Ilands Peninsulaes, Istmus's, Promontories, Climes, Horizons, Meridians, Zones (all done beyond 
Clavius, Sacro Bosco,
 by M
r
 
Hues
 his Book of the use of the Globes) Streights or Fretes, Creekes or Bayes, Lakes, Rivers, with their Rise, Course, Channels, Harbours, Influxes, (done ex∣actly by 
Aurigarius
 in his 
Speculum Nauticum, S
r
 Tho. Reeves
 his 
Histo∣ria Navalis, Pet. de Medina,
 and 
Non∣nius
 his 
Regulae Artis Navigandi.
) Ci∣ties and Towns (which may serve instead of 
Bruinus
 his 
Theatrum Urbium,
 or 
Stephanus
 
) Revenues, Strength, Discipline out of 
Boterus, &c.
 and that too in as compleat a way, as if he had tra∣velled over either all the Books, or all the

 Countries of the World; whereof this little Book contains as handsome particulars, admi∣nistring to Discourse upon all occasions, as any ingenious person that keeps Company can wish.


As little as this Book is, it is not so 
Brief
 as to be 
Obscure,
 onely there being no place for an idle word or letter in so exact a Piece, we have expressed such known words, as 
East, West, North
 and 
South, Latitude
 and 
Longitude, &c.
 with the first letters of them, and divided each Country into its Province, assigning to each Province its Towns, 
&c.
 (without any circum∣locution,—

Ornari res ipsa negat, contenta doceri)
 with the Bounds, Scituation, Length, Breadth, and Estate of each place of Note in the World, whereby a man easily learneth how each place stands its self, and with relations to all others; what its Original is, if now in being, and what its former condition was, if now desolate: And all this with that exactness (
, 
Arist.
) the subject matter is capable of.

Directions to find out any part or place in this Book, desired or sought for:


FIrst,
 You must know, that on both sides the Map, are degrees of Latitude, at every ten of which there is a Circular Line drawn through the Map: 
Secondly,
 at the top and bot∣tom there are Degrees of Longitude; at every 
10
 of which, Lines are drawn through the Map.


Now, if you would find any City or other place of Note, look for it in the Table, and there you shall see what Latitude and what Longitude it hath, which finding at one of the sides, and top of the Map, bringing them till they cut one the other, there you shall find the place.




Example, I would find this City of 
London;
 I look for it in the Table, and there I find it hath 
51
 degrees of Latitude, and 
24
 degrees of Longi∣tude; which 
51
 degrees of Latitude, I find at the side of the Map, and the 
24
 degree of Longitude towards the top of the Map; then I bring them till they cut one another, and there I find the City: So of the rest, note that the degree of Latitude and Longitude must be brought in a circular line, like unto them that are made at every 
10
th
 degree: Withal, observe that 
A∣sia, Affrica
 and 
America
 are divided by the Equinoctial Line, and if above it you fail to speed, repair to that part beneath the Line, and expect a satis∣faction answerable to your expectati∣on, and suitable to your inquisition.

He would not mend his Spanish pace, for all the whipping in Paris.
 Zealous and watchful over women; of great patience; the

 meat little, 
sawce and sallet
 (as Sr.

 answered a Spanish Don) 
much;
 Religion planted by St. 
James,
 and so promoted the Roman way by the

II. 
FRANCE;
 Over the

 like a Lo∣zenge,

 in the Northern temperate Zone, between the middle parallel of the 5
th

th
 Clime, the longest day sixteen hours and an half: the people whereof are said to be 
Wise after a thing is done, the
 Dutch 
in the time of Action, and the
 Ita∣lian 
before it,
 much given to Law, it being said, that there are more Law Suits in 
France
 in seven Years, then there have been in 
England
 since the Conquest. Jovial in their discourses of Religion, witness the man that would not eat the body of Christ, because (though it was on his death-bed) it was upon Friday; and another in the same condition, when a Clownish Priest offered him the Sacrament, that said Christ came to him, as he entred into 
Jerusalem
 upon an Ass. Their Women free and debonair, the Language Voluble and Elegant, said to be Amorous; as the 
Italians
 is Court∣ly, and the 
Spaniards
 manly. Made sweet by the o∣mission of several Consonants, whereupon it was said, the 
French
 pronounce not as they write, sing not as they prick, and speak not as they think. The Land affords plenty of Corn, Wine and
 Salt, besides Beeves, Hogs, Nuts, Woad, Skins, Linnen. The Peasants are slaves to the Lords and King, and the Govern∣ment Arbitrary; the Religion is the Catholick, min∣gled with the Protestant: the Laws temporary and at pleasure, only of late, reduced to a Code; the Salique

 Law, is, that no woman inherit the Crown, called so (say some) from the first words of it, 
si aliquà:
 the 
Spa∣niards
 and the 
English,
 are the great Enemies of 
France;
 and when an English man was asked at our last lea∣ving of 
France, When he should come again;
 He answered, 
When your sins are greater than ours.


It is said, that the best place, 1 to be born is in 
France,
 because the Government is alwayes in a man. 2 To live in is 
Italy,
 because the people are Civil and Ingeni∣ous. 3 To dye in is 
Spain
 where the Religion is Catho∣lick; there are thirty four Havens here, large, safe, defensive, and frequented. 1 In
