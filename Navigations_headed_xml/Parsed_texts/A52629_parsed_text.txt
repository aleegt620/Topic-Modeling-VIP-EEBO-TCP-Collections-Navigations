A Geographicall DESCRIPTION Of the Kingdom of IRELAND.


B
Eing in the North of 
England,
 and de∣sirous to passe into the Kingdom of 
Ireland,
 and not willing to go more Northward, although from 
Galloway
 in 
Scotland,
 (which 
Bede
 terms 
Candida casa,
 the Vulgar 
White-herne
) there be but a short cut, yet more willing to go the nearest way to 
Westchester;
 but not finding the winde fair at my coming, I travell'd along to Saint 
Davis
 in 
Pembroke
-shire, whence I had a speedy passage into 
Ireland,
 but somewhat dangerous, by reason of the sands and shelves which lye off into the sea, but our putting into harbour worse, because of the continuall mists that hang over the low flat land, so that our Pilot could hardly discern his marks.


There are many fair Ports and Harbours for Ships, on the East and South sides of what I shall speak, in the Description of the particular Counties.


Concerning the names of severall Nations and Men, they have their severall conceits, it is known by the name 
Ireland
 to us.


It is an ancient Iland, and not of little esteem, in re∣gard of the greatnesse of it, being accounted the third Iland anciently known in the habitable world, by good Geographers; who say, That of all Ilands, for greatnesse the Indian 
Taprobane
 is chief; the next after it, is 
Bri∣tain;
 and in a third degree, another British Iland, cal∣led 
Hibernia,
 that is, 
Ireland;
 so that 
Ptolomie
 called it 
Little-Britain:
 The situation is under the 10 and 12 Climats, in Longitude extending 4 Degrees from the Meridian of 11 Degrees and half: And the Lati∣tude reacheth 4 Degrees from the paralel of 54, to that of 58 Degrees.


The Inhabitants are divided by the name of Wilde-Irish, and the English Irish, living in the English Pale, where the English at their first going over did inclose themselves.


Formerly it was divided into 5 Kingdoms, now Pro∣vinces; namely 
Mounster,
 lying Southward, 
Lemster
 Eastward, 
Connagh
 in the West, 
Ulster
 in the North, and 
Meth
 in the midst almost.


From North to South, in length 400 miles, in bredth 200 miles.




MOunster,
 in Latine 
Mamonia,
 the Irish 
Mown,
 con∣taineth 6 Counties, besides the County of 
Holy crosse
 in 
Typperary;
 the first is,


Kirry,
 which lyeth near the mouth of the River



Shannon,
 and runneth out narrow at the entrance, but towards the Sea, with a broader promontory im∣braced by the Sea on both sides.


A Countrey mountanous, woody and wild, loftily looking into the Ocean; in which are many fruitfull fields, and pleasant vallyes, beset thick with woods.


A County 
Palatine
 granted to the Earle of 
Des∣mond
 by the speciall favour of 
Edward
 the third; but being often ingratefull in their rebellious treasons, and rebellions lost it.


Towards the Sea there is a territory called 
Clan∣morris;
 not farre off standeth 
Ardart
 a See of a poor Bishop called 
Ardfert.


Towards the South of this runneth a faire River na∣med 
Dingle,
 a commondious Port on the other side na∣med 
Smirwick-sound,
 or St. 
Marywick,
 where the Spa∣nyards to ayde the rebellious Earle of 
Desmond,
 1583. set footing.


Desmond, Desmonia,
 in Irish 
Deswown;
 lyeth large∣ly stretched out towards the South, in which are three high promontories over-topping the Sea, and con∣temning his proud waves, running out into the South∣west, called west-
Mounster.


The first promontory lyeth between 
Dingle-bay
 and the River 
Maire,
 and is called 
Clan-car,
 and hath a Castle built at 
Dunkeran
 by the Carews of 
England,
 in it dwelt 
Donel mac Carty more,
 a L▪ of the Irish bloud.


The second lyeth inclosed within two bayes, 
Maire
 and 
Bantre,
 named 
Bear
-haven.


This for the most part is a leane, barren, hungry soyle, in which lived 
O Swillivant Beare,
 and 
O Swilli∣vant Bantre,
 both of the same stock and high bloud in their Countrey.


The third called 
Eraugh
 situate between 
Bantre
 and 
Balatamore
 or 
Baltamore,
 a bay or creeke famous for the multitude of Herrings that are taken there, in this the 
O Mahouns
 by the gift of the 
Carews
 have large possessions; the 
Calverts
 Lord 
Baltimort
 the South promontory called of the ancients 
Notium,
 is at this day called 
Missen-head,
 the 
Feildings
 are Earls of 
Des∣mond
 and Vicounts 
Callon.


The County of 
Corke,
 anciently reputed a King∣dome, contayning the whole space a long the Sea from 
Lismore
 unto St. 
Brend,
 where it headeth 
Desmond
 westward, in the bowells whereof lyeth 
Muskery,
 a wild Forrest, where 
Cormac mac xeg,
 it is a great name, and towards the Sea coast lyeth 
Carkray,
 in which the 
mac Curties
 have the greatest power.


There lyeth towards the South Sea a Port and road anciently of good safegard for Shipps, but by reason of a barre in the mouth of it, it falls dry at the ebb, and is now of little use, it lyeth four leagues westward from the out-point of 
Kinsale.


Betweene 
Rosse
 and 
Kinsale
 there lyeth a small Iland in the Sea called 
Roem,
 which may be fayled about, having ten fathome water between that and the mayne▪ three leagues from hence lieth 
cape de velho
 or 
Old-head,
 from whence to 
England
 end is 46 leagues, it is a high point reaching forth into the Sea, from whence about a quarter of a league South-west lieth the mouth of the Haven of 
Kinsale:
 a very commodious Port, 10, and 15. fathome going in and 4 or 5 to the very towne which lieth up in the mouth of the river 
Bany
 in a fruit∣full Soyle, furnished with wood, and other commodi∣ties: Lord 
Cour
y
 is Baron of 
Kinsale.


On the other side of 
Kinsale
 lyeth 
Kerry
 wherry a


small territory once belonging to the E. of 
Desmond:
 right before which lyeth the river 
Sauranus
 or 
Severa∣nus
 which fetcheth its first originall from the moun∣taine of 
Muskerry:
 and going along by the head city of the county 
Corke
 by the Irish 
Corcach
 honoured with a Bishops See; together with the See of 
Clumi
 annexed to it.


The river both roundeth and runneth through the middest of the towne not passible, but by bridges lying in length in one broad street having a bridge over it.


It is a towne of great resort and populous▪ but for∣merly subject to the injury of the Rebells; which made them keep a carefull watch against them. That re∣ligious and devout man 
Brioc
 who flourished among the 
Sauls
 was borne and bred here.


Below 
Corke
 the parting of the river maketh a sweet and pleasant Iland over against the chiefe dwelling house of the 
Barries,
 called 
Barry
 Court, derived from 
Robert de Barry
 an Englishman; who behaved himselfe valiantly in the Irish warres, and was the first that man∣ned and brought the Hauke to hand in Ireland: he had the title of Baron 
Barry;
 but after of Vicount 
Beuti∣phant.


The former river empties into the Sea below 
Barry
 Court neare 
Imokelly
 a faire possession long since of the Earles of 
Desmond;
 and containes a safe road in the mouth of it.


As this supplyes the lower part of the country, so 
Black-water,
 called anciently 
Even-more,
 the great river moystneth the upper part, upon which dwelleth the Noble familie of 
Roeh,
 who went out of England, and flourished there and enjoyed the title of Vicount 
Fer∣moy:
 and were Parliament Barons in 
Edward
 the 2. time.


Yoghall
 standeth on this rivers mouth, a Major town, nor great, but walled about, builded in length, and di∣vided into two parts, the upper reacheth Norwest, and hath a Church in it, and the lower part Southwest; the commodiousnesse of the Key makes it much frequent∣ed by Merchants.


The County of 
Waterford
 lyeth in the East side of 
Ireland,
 stretching out it self between the rivers, 
Broad∣water
 West, and 
Shour
 East; the Main on the South, and 
Tipperary
 Norwest; both delightsome, and very profitable.


When 
Broadwater
 hath out-run the County of 
Cork,
 behinde it 
Lismore
 presently sheweth it self, an Episco∣pall See where 
Christian
 once sate, that was of the same Cloyster with Saint 
Bernard,
 and Pope 
Eugenius;
 but now annexed unto 
Waterford:
 The 
Lumly's
 are Vicounts of 
Waterford.


At the mouth of which river standeth 
Aidmore,
 a small town, so called because it standeth near the Sea.


Not far from hence standeth 
Dungarvan,
 having a strong hold of good force: It is a Tide-haven 8 leagues from 
Waterford,
 full of rocks, and deep within the harbour.


Vicount 
Dessee,
 together with the Barony of 
Dun∣garvan,
 King 
Henry
 the sixth granted to 
Iohn Talbut
 Earl of 
Shrewsbury;
 but afterward, seeing it lay con∣veniently to that part of 
Mounster
 that was to bee brought under, and reduced into order, it was by a Par∣liament annexed to the Crown of 
England.


On the side of the river 
Shour, Waterford
 the princi∣pall City of this County maketh a fair shew; the Irish and Britains call it 
Porthlargie,
 the English 
Waterford,
 37 leagues from 
Englands
 end.


It was built by certain Pirats of 
Norway;
 the ayr is grosse and unhealthy, the soil not fertile, the streets pent and narrow; yet by reason of the commodiousnesse of the harbour, which is fair and wide, 10 or 11 fathom deep going in, it is much frequented, and of great re∣sort, driving a quick trade, so that it is esteemed the se∣cond City in the Kingdom, and hath continued alwaies true and loyall to the Crown of 
England,
 ever since 
Richard
 Earl of 
Pembroke
 wan it first, and hath recei∣ved many favours and priviledges from the Kings of 
England
 for their good services.


And 
Henry
 the seventh augmented them much, for their discreet carriage of themselves against the mock-Prince 
Perkin Warbeck,
 who counterfeited 
Richard
 the third, under which colour he couzened a great Peer of 
Scotland
 of his fair daughter.


This County of 
Waterford,
 together with the City, King 
Henry
 the sixth gave unto 
Iohn Talbut
 Earl of 
Shrewsbury.


But by reason of wars in 
France,
 and the civil dissen∣tions between the houses of 
York
 and 
Lancaster,
 the Kings of 
England
 were busied, and the Nobles so in∣tangled in those broils, that they could not intend the affairs of 
Ireland,
 so that the Irish grew very insolent and powerfull: So that in the 28 year of 
H.
 8. though the fault were committed long before his dayes; yet for punishment, by Act of Parliament it was or∣dered, That the heirs of many Noblemen, as the Earl of 
Shrewsbury, Ormond,
 the Duke of 
Norfolk,
 and Ba∣ron 
Barkley,
 and all the Abbots and Priors (for they were all found liable to this punishment) with the rest, should forfeit all their lands and demeans in 
Ireland,
 in∣to the Kings hands for such neglect and absence.


The County of 
Limrick
 is an inland County, lying behinde that of 
Cork
 Northward, between 
Kerry,
 the river 
Shanon,
 and the County of 
Tipperary
 a very fruit∣full and populous place, but not eminent for any thing of note.


The Western part of it is called 
Conilagh,
 wherein there is 
Knoc Patrick,
 a very high hill, from whence there is a pleasant prospect into the Sea; where you may see how 
Shanon
 fals in to the Virginian.


The head City is 
Limrick,
 which 
Shanon
 by parting begirteth round, the Irish call it 
Loumeagh,
 and the English 
Limrick;
 it is a chief Market-town of 
Moun∣ster,
 and the See of a Bishop, and at this day called two Towns; the upper, wherein stands the Cathedrall Church, and a Castle, and hath two gates, and each of them a stone Bridge with bulwarks, the one leading in∣to the West, the other into the East, unto which the lower Town joyneth, fenced with a wall, and a Castle thereto, and a fore-gate at the entrance into it: Lord 
Esmond
 is Baron of 
Limrick.


In the South of this County is 
Kilmallo,
 the next Town to 
Limrick
 both in substance and inhabitants, incompassed likewise with a wall: Vicount 
Sarsfield
 of 
Kilmallo.


Not far off standeth 
Adare,
 a little Town, hard unto which lyeth 
Elan Gibbon,
 where dwelt the White-Knight, so called for his gray hairs.


The other inhabitants of note are the 
Lacyes, Browns, H
rlyes, Chacyes, Sapells,
 and 
Pourcells,
 all of English race; also the 
Mac Shees, Mac Brian, O Brien,
 of Irish blood.


The County of 
Tipperary
 is bounded Westward, with 
Limrick
 and the river 
Shanon
 Eastward, with the


County of 
Kilkenny,
 with the County of 
Corke
 and 
Water∣ford
 southward, and North with the territories of the 
O Ca∣rolls.
 The south-part hath much corne, and many beauti∣full buildings, and the river 
Glason
 runneth with a large course thorow the West-part of it; not farre from whose bankes stands 
Emly
 or 
Awn,
 a Bishops See: thorow the middest of it glideth that goodly river 
Shour,
 or 
Swire,
 which issuing out of 
Bladin
 hills, hasteth thorow the lower 
Ossery:
 of which 
Hen.
 8. dignified the 
Butlers
 with the title of Earles, and thorow 
Thurles,
 which honoureth the same Family with the dignity of Vicounts; and so goeth into 
Holy-crosse,
 termed the County of the 
Holy-crosse
 of 
Tipp:


Then 
Shour
 goeth besides 
Cassile,
 honoured with the dig∣nity of an Arch-bishop, by 
Eugenius,
 third Pope of 
Rome;
 from thence runneth the River down 
Shreading
 Ilands here and there, and fetcheth a round about 
Cahir
 Castle, then holding his course by 
Clomel,
 a frequented Market-towne, as also by 
Carick-mac-Griffin
 situate upon a rock; it then leaveth 
Tipperary
 behind it, and is instead of a banke to con∣fine the countries of 
Waterford
 and 
Kilkenny.


The 
Botelers
 or 
Butlers
 are great Families in this Coun∣tie, and were neere of alliance unto 
Thomas A Becket,
 for whose sake 
Henry
 the second did honour and enrich them.


For the government of which Province, that it might be kept from rebellion and seditious tumults, queene 
Eliza∣beth
 out of her Princely care and wisdome, first ordained Sir 
Warham Sellenger
 or Saint 
Leger,
 a man well seene in 
Irish
 affaires, to be Lord President, with one Assistant, two Lawyers, and a Secretary.






THe second part or Province is 
Leinster,
 which hath se∣ven Counties, it is called by the Irish 
Leighnigh,
 by the Britaines 
Lein,
 lying all towards the Sea Eastward, a fer∣tile,


healthfull, and beautifull place. The first County is 
Kilkenny,
 bounded West with 
Tipperary:
 East with the Counties of 
Weisford
 and 
Caterlogh:
 South with the Coun∣ty of 
Waterford:
 North with queenes County; and Nor∣west with upper 
Ossery,
 a County surpassing the rest in faire buildings, strong Forts, and exceeding plentifull in all manner of provision.


Neere unto 
Ossery
 there standeth a very great mountain, called 
Sleiew Bloemy,
 towring very high, out of whose wombe issue these Rivers, 
Shour, Neor
 and 
Barrow▪
 running in several streames againe joyne before they enter the Oce∣an, and called of old the three Sisters.


This River 
Neor,
 commonly called 
Neure,
 runneth, as it were, thorow 
Kilkenny
 County, and when it is passed the upper 
Ossery,
 and hath watered many fortresses on both sides, it floweth besides 
Kilkenny,
 which is a rich and beau∣tifull Towne, farre exceeding any inland Burrough in 
Ire∣land:
 Parted into the English towne and Irish towne, the Irish towne being, as it were, the Suburbs, and hath in it S. 
Canicks
 Church, where the Bishop of 
Ossery
 hath his See.


But the English towne is nothing so ancient, builded by 
Ranulph
 third Earle of 
Chester;
 walled on the West-side by 
Robert Talbot,
 and fortified with a castle by the 
Butlers.


Below 
Neore
 somewhat standeth a little walled towne, called 
Thomas
 towne, in Irish 
Bala mac Anda,
 that is, the towne of 
Antonies
 sonne.


Below this, the River 
Callan
 emptieth it self into 
Neore,
 on whose bankes standeth the towne 
Callan,
 the third in∣corporate towne of this County, as likewise 
Inise Yeog
 which is the fourth.


Many Families of the 
Butlers
 in this County of good account, and some other Gentry, as the 
Graces, Walshes, Lo∣vels, Forresters, Shortels, Blanch-feilds,
 or 
Blanch-velstors, Drilands, Come
fords,
 &c.


The County of 
Caterlogh,
 called by contraction 
Car∣logh,
 Eastward joyneth to 
Kilkenny,
 lying almost betweene the Rivers 
Barrow
 and 
Slane,
 fruitfull and well furnished with woods; the two principall townes stand on the west∣banke of 
Barrow: Carlogh
 walled and fortified with a Ca∣stle: Also 
Leighlin,
 once a Bishops See, now joyned to that of 
Fernes▪
 Both of them of good force, and Constables o∣ver them: From hence 
Barrow
 runneth thorow the Lord∣ship of 
Ydron.
 Upon the River 
Slane
 is seated 
Tullo,
 a 
But∣ler
 being honoured by King 
Iames
 with the title of Vi∣count 
Tullo.


The 
Cavanaghs
 are a name much spread, valiant and ex∣cellent horsemen: From 
Carterlogh, Neore
 and 
Barrow
 run hand in hand some few miles, and after fall into the lap of their eldest sister the 
Shour,
 who all are swallowed up pre∣sently of the devouring Ocean.


The County of 
Leaz,
 or queenes County, so called from queene 
Mary,
 who first made it a County, lying above 
Ca∣terlogh
 towards the Norwest, a small County full of woods and bogs; the chiefe towne is 
Mary-burgh,
 there was used watch and ward to defend themselves from the insolencies of the Irish 
O Moores,
 against 
Mac Gilpatrick,
 the 
O Dem∣psies,
 who were very turbulent and seditious.


Many Castles and Forts in this County, one at 
Tahmelio,
 another at 
Obowy,
 a third on the River 
Barrow,
 and a fourth at 
Norrach;
 little else of moment in this County.


Amulenux
 is Vicount of 
Mary-burgh,
 the principall towne in this County.


Kings County; called formerly 
Offaly,
 but for the ho∣nour of King 
Philip
 made a County; the chiefe towne is 
Philips
 town: the 
Dempsies,
 Vicount 
Glenmare,
 and Baron of 
Philips
 town.


Many English Families seated here, as the 
Warrens, Her∣berts,


Colbeis, Moris, Leicesters.
 Some Families of the Irish, which suppose they have had hard measure in being dispos∣sessed of their ancient inheritances, seeke all occasion to do the English a displeasure, and wil omit no opportunity to revenge: so that it ever did, and now more especially it behoveth the English to be circumspect and wary.


The County of 
Kildare,
 lying eastward from the for∣mer Counties, a pleasant, healthfull and fertile countrey, full of springs and pastures: the chiefe town an Episcopall See beares the name of the County 
Kildare;
 the noble Fa∣milies of the 
Fitz-Geralds
 hold the Earldome, granted by 
Edward
 the second.


This County was first inhabited by the Earle of 
Pem∣broke
 and his heires, untill 
Edward
 the first.


The 
Geraldines
 continued loyall untill 
Henry
 the 8. and then one of them unadvisedly rebelled, but was punished, and his confederates: howbeit queene 
Mary
 restored bloud and lands.


The places of note above the rest is 
Naas
 a Market town, 
Athie
 placed on the River 
Barrow; Mainoth
 a Castle be∣longing to the Earle of 
Kildare,
 and a Market-town.


Castle-martin,
 the chiefe seat of the Family of 
Fitz-Eu∣stace,
 which descended from the 
Poers,
 who had the title of Vicount 
Baltinglas
 added by 
Henry
 the eighth.


But having lost that title by attainder, the 
Ropers
 beare the honour of Vicount 
Baltinglas.


The chiefe Families derive from the English▪ there are the 
Ougans, de la Hides, Ailmers, Walshes, Boisels, Whites, Suttons,
 &c. Now we have done with the midland Coun∣tries of 
Lymster,
 we goe now to the Sea-side.


The County of 
Weisford,
 or 
Wexford,
 being a small cir∣cuit of land, lying on the Sea side against 
Beneath,
 the mouth of the three former sister Rivers eastward, in a pro∣montory


where the shore fetcheth a compasse round, is placed the County of 
Wexford,
 in Irish 
Reogh;
 here on the river 
Barrow
 there was a faire citie, called 
Rosse,
 well traded and peopled, but by discord and dissention, onely a great wall left as the ruines of a huge pile: but the 
Hervys
 are dignified with the title of Barons of 
Rosse.


Eastward 
Duncannon
 Castle standeth over the River, and can hinder any ships from passing either to 
Waterford
 or 
Rosse:
 from thence there runs out a little neck of land, which is a helpe unto sea-men to saile into the River; not farre off standeth 
Tinterne
 upon the shore, with many windings & creeks, where once there was a famous Abbey.


This Promontory is called 
Holy-head,
 lying over against Saint 
Davids
 in 
Wales;
 at which place the English first set footing into 
Ireland,
 where there is a towne by the natives called 
Banna,
 which signifies 
Holy.


Along the shore eastward lye many flats, which the ma∣riners call the grounds, and endanger their ships.


The River 
Slane
 cuts quite thorow this County, and in the mouth thereof, where it maketh a poole, there lyeth 
Weisford
 the chiefe towne; it is not of any great bignesse, but yet memorable, in that being assaulted by 
Fitz Stephen,
 a valiant Captaine, it yeelded it selfe unto his protection, and became a Colony of the English, so that still it useth the ancient apparrell of the English, and their speech, but somewhat mingled with Irish.


Eniscort
 is seated on the River 
Slane,
 and 
Fernes
 is seated more inward, an Episcopal See; beyond which River dwelt the 
Cavenaghs, Donels, Montaghs,
 and 
O Moores,
 of Irish race, stirring tumultuous-spirits and amongst them the 
Sinottes, Roches
 and 
Peppers
 English.


Vicount 
Mount-garretto,
 the 
Butlers
 are the men of note on this side 
Slane:
 many more English of note,


as most of the common sort English.


The County of 
Divelin
 or 
Dublin,
 on the East lyeth broad upon the Sea, on the west bounded with the County of 
Kildare,
 on the south, on two small territories of 
Wicklo
 and 
Arcklo,
 once the habitation of the 
O Tools
 and 
O Birns,
 and now termed the 
Glimes▪
 and norwest limited with the County of 
Meth,
 and 
Nanny
 a small River.


It is a very plentifull County both in corne and cattell, abounding also with game for pleasure; their greatest want is fuell, which is a heavie turfe or English sea-coale, but in the south side a barren soile, hils and woods plenty, many hollow valleyes over-run with trees, which they call 
Gli∣nus,
 among which was the Bishoprick of 
Glandelaw,
 but now annexed to the Archbishop of 
Dublin.


All the rest of the County is rich and plentious, the peo∣ple of a stately port and garbe, in gentile neatnesse and car∣riage surpassing all the rest of 
Ireland;
 and it is divided in∣to five severall Baronies, 
Rath-downe, New-castle, Castle∣knoc, Cowloc
 and 
Balrodry.


This whole County is 
Neptunes
 neighbor, no part there∣of being twenty miles distant from the Sea.


To the south of 
Dublin
 Haven standeth 
Wicklo,
 a narrow Haven, over which bends a rocke immured strongly with fortification in stead of a Castle, whose command none ought to have but English borne: Lord 
Maynard
 hath the title of Baron.


Then from the top of a hill, 
New-castle
 looketh into the Sea in the sight of the three shelves, which they call the south, middle, and north grounds, lying in length, yet shall you find betweene them and the shore seven or eight fa∣thome of water.


A little higher where the River 
Bray
 disburdens into the Sea, is seene 
Oldcourt,
 the possessions of the 
Walshes
 of 
Ca∣rickmain,



who are a large and ancient stocke.


Next are 
Powers
 or 
Poerscourt,
 belonging formerly to a Family of that name, since the 
Wingfeilds
 have the title of Vicount 
Powerscourt.


A little Iland Saint 
Bennets,
 belonging to the Archbi∣shop of 
Dublin,
 lyeth in an elbow of land which the River 
Bray
 maketh.


The creeke or bay is called 
Dublin
 Haven, which is five leagues from 
Wexford,
 into which Haven the greatest River of this County powreth it selfe, called 
Liffy,
 whose origi∣nall being but fifteene miles distance from that place, yet through his many windings and turnings he watereth many countries.


First south, by Saint 
Patricks
 land, then westward, after north, watering the County of 
Kildare▪
 at length into the east by 
Castle-knoc,
 and so by 
Kilmainam.


Dublin
 is seated seven miles from the mouth of 
Liffy,
 it is the most famous towne of all 
Ireland,
 the Irish call it 
Bala Cleigh,
 that is, the town set upon hurdles, for the first foundation thereof was laid upon hurdles, by reason of the soft unsetled ground, like as 
Sivil
 in 
Spaine
 is said to bee built on piles, 
Venice
 on woolsack, or such like matter of foundation, it is an ancient towne, yet was much rent and defaced in the 
Danish
 warres; after it became subject to 
Edgar,
 King of 
England,
 who in his Charter cals it, The most noble City of 
Ireland.


Then the 
Norwegians
 got it in possession, and at last it fell to the English, who defended it against the Irish, and was planted with a Colony of 
Bristow
 men, on whom King 
Henry
 the second bestowed this City, and all the liberties and franchises which the men of 
Bristow
 have; of which City many write in praise and commendation, one thus:


A City, in regard of the people, noble, of the site most


pleasant, by reason of the Sea and River meeting together, rich and plentifull in fish, for traffick famous, for the green plaines delightfull and lovely, beset with woods of mast∣bearing-trees, incompassed about with Parkes of Deere▪ So another:


Develin,
 a maritine towne, is the mother City of all 
Ireland,
 having to it an Haven passing well frequented, for traffick and enter course of Merchants matchable with our 
London.


There are many Keyes and Wharfs along the River, jet∣ting out to stop the violence of the water.


A very strong wall of rough building stone, reacheth a∣long by the sides of it, which openeth at six gates, from whence there runne forth suburbs of great length.


Towards the east is 
Dammes
 gate, and neere it the Kings Castle, very strong both by art and nature; and an Armo∣ry or storehouse built by 
Henry Lounders
 Archb. 1220.


Saint 
Andrews
 Church stands in the east suburbs, not farre from which is Trinity Colledge, which queene 
Eli∣zabeth
 honoured with the title and priviledges of an Uni∣versity.


The north gate openeth at the Bridge built by King 
John
 of Arch-worke, and this uniteth 
Oustmans
 towne to the City: for here the Easterlings, that came out of 
Norway,
 placed themselves about 1050.


In the south quarter of the City stand two gates, 
Or∣monds,
 and 
Newgate
 the common prison.


These lead into Saint 
Thomas
 street, being large and long, where there stands a great Abbey of that name founded by 
Henry
 the second, for the expiation of the murder of 
Tho∣mas A Becket,
 as some say.


Into the south openeth 
Pauls
 gate, and Saint 
Nicholas,
 which maketh a way into Saint 
Patricks
 suburbs, wherein


standeth the Archbishops Palace, called Saint 
Sepulchers,
 and a stately Church dedicated unto Saint 
Patrick,
 having an arched roofe of stone, and a tall steeple.


It maintaines a Deane, a Chaunter, a Chauncellor, a Treasurer, two Archdeacons, and 22 Prebendaries; the only light and lampe (as the Parliament of that Kingdome said of it) of all godly and Ecclesiasticall discipline and order in 
Ireland.


There is another Cathedrall Church standing in the very heart of the city, called Christ-church; neere the south side of which standeth the towne Hall, built of square stone, and called the Tolestall, where the Sessions of the city are kept.


The chiefe Officer was a Provost, but 
Henry
 the fourth gave them liberty to choose a Major, and two Bayliefes, after King 
Edward
 the sixth, changed the two Bayliefes in∣to two Sheriffes.


No inconvenience save only that the ebbing and flowing of the Sea doth much choake the mouth of 
Liffy,
 that hin∣der great vessels from going up, and makes them to observe the high water for transporting of goods.


Where 
Liffy
 dyeth in the Ocean, 
Houth
 standeth com∣passed in a manner round with the Sea: of which those no∣bles Saint 
Lawrence
 hold the Barony.


Not farre off is 
Malehide
 or 
Molachid,
 belonging to the 
Talbots.


More within the countrey is 
Fingall,
 a little place, but very well husbanded, even the garner and store-house of this Kingdome, so great store of corne it yeeldeth every yeare.


This place discovers the idlenesse of the other Counties, which would equally answer the industry of the labourer, if it were imployed.


Divers worshipfull Families are placed here and there of English in this County, as namely the 
Plunkets,
 who are still Earle of 
Fingall,
 and Lord of 
Kellene, Barnwels, Rus∣sels, Talbots, Dillons, Net
orvils, Lutterels, Burnels, Fitz∣williams, Gouldings, Ushers, Cadlyes, Finglasses, Sarfeilds, Blackneys, Crucyes, Baths,
 &c.






NOw we come to the Province of 
Meth,
 because it lyeth
 in the middle; for strength and safety called the Cham∣ber of 
Ireland:
 peaceable likewise in the 38. yeare of 
Hen∣ry
 the eight, divided into east 
Meth
 and west 
Meth.


The County of east 
Meth
 is compassed with 
Kildare,
 on the south with the County of 
Dublin,
 and the Sea east; on the north with the territory of 
Louth,
 and with the County of west-
Meth
 on the west.


The whole is divided into eighteene Baronies, 
viz. Due∣leke, Scrine, Slane, Margallen, Navan, Kenlis,
 halfe the Ba∣rony of 
Fower
 neere 
Kenlis, Killalou, Clove, Moylagh, Log∣herne, Old-castle, Luyn, Moyfeuraragh, Deese, Rath-touth,
 and 
Dunboyne.


Boyne,
 a faire River, springs out of the north side of the Kings County, runneth thorow this country.


In the remotest places on this side 
Boyne,
 are these me∣morable places, 
Galtrim, Killin
 Castle, 
and Dunsany:
 On the further side of 
Boyne
 are 
Trimletstown, Gormanston
 and 
Slane:
 the 
Fleming
 Lord of it: of the next before Vicount 
Preston, Barnwell
 Baron of the other, 
Plunket
 Lord of 
Dun∣sany.


Among these last stands a Market-towne, called 
Aboy,
 upon the River 
Boyn,
 which passing 
Glan Jores,
 that is, the Land of 
George
 runneth under 
Trim,
 a fine towne of trade, having a Castle erected by 
William Pepard.


So it flowes besides 
Navan,
 the Barony of the 
Lamberts,



where the Bishops house is, who having no Cathedrall Church, doth all with the assent of the Clergie of 
Meth.


Boyn
 then running higher and swifter neere unto 
Dro∣dagh,
 the 
Moores
 being intitled Vicount of it, loseth him∣selfe in the Ocean.


Many chief Families of English blood are in this coun∣tie: the 
Brabazens
 being Earles of east 
Meth.


The county of west 
Meth,
 so called in regard of the si∣tuation, in relation to the former, and reacheth to the Ri∣ver 
Shanon,
 and lyeth betweene the Kings county south, and 
Longford
 county north, to which it is not much inferiour in any thing, if answerable in civility.


Molingar
 is the chiefe towne, as lying in the midst, com∣passed with many bogges.


It is parted into twelve Baronies, 
viz. Fertulogh, Ferbile, Delvin,
 of which the 
Nugents
 were Barons, and now Earls of west 
Meth: Fourry,
 as also 
Corkery, Moyassell,
 where the 
Tuts
 inhabited, 
Moygoisy, Rathcomire, Magirquirke,
 all pro∣pagated from English blood; 
Clonlalon, Moycassell,
 meere Irish beare sway. And others of more harsh and unpleasant names, yet better liked of the Irish than our English names: so that one of them said he would not learne Eng∣lish, lest it should make him have a wry mouth.


Hugh Lacy
 subdued this county, and had it given unto him by 
Henry
 the second, who intending to build a Castle, and bowing downe his head to shew the carpenter how hee would have a peece of timber squared, had his head cut off by the same carpenter with an axe which hee held in his hand.


The county of 
Longford
 lyeth on the north side of west 
Meth,
 made a county not long since, called 
Anale,
 before inhabited most by Irish, and those potent and turbulent.


Shannon
 runneth along this county on the side of it, and


ariseth out of 
Therne
 hils in the county of 
le Trim,
 and flowing along makes many open pools, and after contracts himselfe againe, and then runneth into a large broad mere called 
Lough Regith,
 but after findes his bankes againe, on which stands the towne 
Athlon:
 from thence 
Shannon
 ha∣ving passed the water-fall at 
Killoloe,
 being very large and deepe, six or seven fathome water: disjoynes, running with open armes to the imbracement of the city 
Limrick;
 from whence speeding about sixty miles in length, making here and there an Iland, and where he grew shallow and passible, there formerly stood forts and bulwarkes to hinder the in∣rode of the pilfering Irish; and at last running with open mouth beyond 
knoc Patrick,
 is devoured by the westerne Ocean: two Irish Septs most powerfull and eminent in this county 
O-Pharoll Boy,
 and 
O-Pharoll Ban;
 the Lord 
Aungiers
 are dignified with the title of Baron of 
Long∣ford.






Another Province is 
Conaght,
 wherein are six Counties.


1 
Twomond,
 or the county 
Clare,
 which the Irish call 
Twowoun,
 that is, north-
Mounster,
 for so formerly was the name, untill Sir 
Henry Syd
y
 laid it unto 
Con∣naught,
 shooting out with a narrow promontory into the Sea westward, and on the east and south side, inclosed with the large streame of the River 
Shannon,
 and to the west with the maine, on the north barred with the county 
Gal∣loway,
 so that there is no entring of it by land.


The territories of 
Clan Richard
 are very fruitfull and commodious both for sea and land, onely vexed with bad and idle creatures, lazie inhabitants.

O fortunati si sua norint:


Did they but truly consider the benefit that would acrew


by industry, how would they indeavour? As hath appeared by the care and paines of some English of note and esteem, as the 
Muscegros
 and 
Clares,
 who have built many forts and townes, from whom 
Clare
 the chiefe towne takes name.


Other places of note 
Kilfennerag,
 and 
Killalloe Orlaon
 the Bishops seat, where there stands a Rock in the middest of the channell of 
Shannon,
 from which the water maketh a great noyse in the fall thereof, and which is a great barre and hinderance, that no vessels can passe any further.


Not farre from this banke stands 
Bunraty,
 made a Mar∣ket towne by 
Henry
 3. and is fortified with a Castle.


Seven miles off appeareth 
Clare,
 the principall towne, at a creek (flowing from 
Shannon
) full of Ilands, the chiefe Families are Irish, (the English being degenerated whol∣ly) 
mac Nemors, mac Mahon, O-Loughton,
 the 
O Brians,
 the chiefe of all, and of ancient descent, and now Earls of 
Tho∣mond,
 and who did good service against the Irish in Queen 
Elizabeth's
 time.


The County of 
Galloway
 boundeth South on 
Clare,
 West on the Sea: North on County 
Maio,
 and East on 
Shannon,
 abounding both in corne and cattle.


The West-shore is very craggy and rugged, with a long border of greene Ilands; foure of which called 
Aran,
 make a Barony: also 
Inis Ceath,
 where the Monastery of 
Colman
 is a devout Saint founded for Scots and English; but their continuall discord made the English quite forsake it.


More within lyeth a lake called 
logh Corbes,
 spreading twenty miles in length, and three or foure in breadth, being navigable, furnished with three hundred small Ilands full of grasse and Pine-trees; but towards the Sea this lake is more streightned, and runnes under 
Gallway,
 Irish 
Gallive,
 called so from the people 
Gallaeci
 in 
Spaine;
 a chiefe town, and little inferiour to any in 
Ireland,
 built round like a


Tower, a Bishops See much frequented by Merchants, in∣vited by a commodious haven and safe roade.


Foure miles from hence stands 
Knoc-toe,
 that is, the hill of Axes; and not farre off 
Aterith,
 having a large wall, but poorely inhabited: the 
Birminghams
 are Barons of English race, but of Irish disposition.


The better sort of Irish are 
O Kelleis, O Maiden, O Flairles, mac Dervis
 &c.,


The country of 
clan Richard
 lyeth at the entrance of this County, and is annexed to it; it tooke the name from 
Richard de Burgh,
 out of which stock 
Henry
 the eight made an Earle of 
Clan Rich,
 whose eldest sonne hath the title of Baron of 
Dun Kellis:
 In this territory is the Archbishops See of 
Toam,
 unto which many Bishopricks were former∣ly subject, but now only three.


The County of 
Maio
 limited on the West by the Oce∣an, South by 
Gollway,
 East by the County of 
Roscoman,
 and North by the county of 
Slige,
 very rich and fruitfull, abounding with cattle, Deere, Hawks, and honey; taking its name from a little city which had a Bishops See, but now laid to 
Toam
 (as I said) but the inhabitants are under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of 
Killaly▪
 Lord 
Bourgh
 is Vicount 
Maio.


There is a remarkable lake at the West side of this cal∣led 
Loghmesk,
 full of fish, and two small Ilands: this Coun∣ty is inhabited with a valiant kind of people stout and har∣die, most of which were invited by the rebels out of the Scottish Ilands the 
Hebrides
 to aid 
mac William,
 and 
mac Conell,
 who were defeated by Captain 
Bingham,
 Governor of 
Conagh.


The County of 
Slego
 lying along the Westerne Sea: betweene it and 
Ulster
 Northward runneth the River 
T
o∣bis
 issuing from the lake Erne, it is parted from the borde∣ring


Counties: 
Le Trim
 and 
Roscoman
 by the vast Curlew hills; and cut in twaine by the River 
Suc,
 it is very fit and convenient for the breeding and rearing of cattle.


Sligo
 is the principall place of this county, where there stands a castle, under which is the Bay of 
Slego,
 a road full of good harbours for shipping; the chiefe names, besides the 
O Conors,
 are 
O Don, O Harris, O Ghar,
 and 
mac Do∣nagh.


There is an honourable Family in 
Herefordshire,
 now dignified with the title of Baron 
Scudamore
 of 
Dromore,
 and Vicount of 
Sligo.


The County of 
le Trim,
 formerly called 
Breany,
 which incloseth the county of 
Sligo
 on the East, and was the pos∣sessions of that ancient Family of the 
Rorck,
 untill 
Brion O Rorck
 rebelled in queen 
Elizabeths
 dayes, who was cha∣sed into 
Scotland,
 and sent thence into 
England,
 and there hanged, so that his lands fell unto the Crown: the 
Sherards
 are Barons of 
le Trim;
 after it was made a county by the Lord Deputy, and called 
le Trim
 from the chiefe towne.


This county is full of rising hills, and very fat ranke pa∣stures; so that one saith of it (but how true I know not) that it is so full of forrage, that unlesse cattle were kept sometimes from grazing, their fulnesse would endanger them: but so fruitfull and fertile it is, that in a small cir∣cuit of ground, it was able at once to shew one hundred and twenty thousand head of beasts; here is the See of the Bi∣shop of 
Achonry,
 united to the See of 
Elphin.


The head of the long and large river 
Shannon
 first shew∣eth it selfe here.


The Families of note, O 
Rorck,
 O 
Murreis, mac Loch∣leims, mac Glancheis,
 and 
mac Granelles,
 all meere Irish.


The County of 
Roscoman
 lieth Southwest from 
le Trim,
 made a county likewise by 
Henry Sidney
 Lord Deputy, be∣ing


long, but narrow, and bound with the Rivers 
Suc
 East∣ward, and 
Shannon
 Westward, and on the North with 
Cur∣lew
 mountaines, which are high and impassible untill a cut was made thorow them.


It is a plain fertile countrey, much abounding with cat∣tle, because tillage is too painfull for the inhabitants.


There are foure Baronies in this county, lying under 
Curlew
 hils, by the River 
Shannon.


1 That of 
Boyle,
 where 
mac Dermot
 is chiefe.


2 That of 
Balin Tober,
 by the River 
Suc,
 where O 
Co∣ner Dun,
 is of greatest power, and upon it joyneth 
Elphen
 the Bishops See.


Somewhat lower lyeth 
Roscomon,
 the Barony of O 
Co∣ner Roo;
 but the 
Dillons
 since have been Earls of 
Roscommon,
 in which place is feated the chiefe town, but now poore and meane.


More Southward lyeth 
Athlone,
 the Barony of the O 
Kellies,
 so named of the head town, which hath a castle in it, and a most beautifull bridge of hewen stone, built by queen 
Elizabeth,
 and thought it the most convenient place for the Lord Deputies to reside, the better to suppresse se∣ditions.






The fifth part or Province is 
Ulster,
 the North part of 
Ireland
 hath ten Counties.


THe County of 
Louth,
 in Irish 
Iriel
 or 
Uriel
 situated beyond 
Meth,
 and the River 
Boyn
 runneth out with a shore bending towards the North.


A fruitfull and pleasant soyle if well imployed neere 
Boyns
 mouth is seated 
Drogheda,
 or in English 
Tredagh,
 a fine town well peopled and frequented, so called of the Bridge; 
Boyne
 cutting it thorow; it hath both a Market


and Faire granted by King 
Edward
 the second, as also a Mint once there; The 
Moores
 now beare the honour of Vi∣count 
Drogheda.


Not farre off stands 
Mellifont
 Abbey, much praised by Saint 
Bernard,
 given by queene 
Elizabeth
 to Sir 
Edward Moore
 of 
Kent.


Seven miles off standeth 
Ardeth,
 an inland town, and a∣bove it 
Dundakle,
 having a commodious haven, and for∣merly a wall, which 
Edward Br
,
 the King of 
Scots
 bro∣ther did burne, but after both himselfe and forces slain and defeated by Sir 
John Birmingham:
 the Lord 
Gorges
 are Barons of it.


Eight miles from hence stands 
Carlingford,
 a port of good use and frequencie: the 
Swifts
 are honoured with the title of Vicounts of this place, the names of note are 
Ver∣dons, Tates, Clintons, Bellewes, Donedalls, Wottons, and some others.
 Sir 
John Birmingham,
 before named, was formerly Earle of 
Louth.
 But 
Henry
 the eight honoured Sir 
Oliver plunket
 with the Barony of 
Louth.


The County of 
Cavan
 lying to the West of 
Louth,
 and formerly called East 
Brieny,
 the habitation of 
O Kellies,
 who have been powerfull in horsemen, for the suppressing of whom, Sir 
Henry Sidney
 divided it into seven severall Baronies, to hold in fee from the Crown of 
England;
 they have no townes, but dwell scattered here and there in forts and piles: they have a poore Bishop of their owne, whose See is at 
Kilmore;
 yet somewhat better than those Irish Bishops who had no other rents and revenues than three milch kine; which being dry, the Parishioners did change for a new milch one: the L. 
Lambert
 or Barons of 
Cavan.


The County of 
Fermanagh
 lyeth to the West and nore of 
Cavan,
 full of woods and many boggs, in the middest whereof is the greatest lake in 
Ireland,
 called 
logh Erne,
 reaching out forty miles, very full of inhabited Hands,


some containing three hundred, others foure hundred a∣cres of land, and the banks of the lake are set all with shady woods. Such plenty of fish, Pikes, Trouts and Salmons, that rhe nets are broken a peeces often with the great draughts.


At 
Bal Tarbet
 a little towne, first it stretcheth six miles in length from South to North; then for the space of six miles it narroweth, in which space standeth 
Inis Kil∣lin
 a faire Castle, from which 
Brian mac Guir
 takes his Barony. Then it greatly inlargeth it selfe towards the Sea, as far as to 
Belek,
 neere unto which is a great down-fall of water, that most renowned Salmons leape.


Mac Guir
 was chiefe untill his rebellion; many of that Family dwel on both sides: and those beyond the Lake are counted of 
Ulster,
 and they on this side of 
Conagh.


The County 
Monaghan
 lyeth on the West side of the former great Lake, having many hills and much wood, not having any towne but 
Monaghan,
 which imparts its name to the County: which is divided into five Baronies, 
Iriel, Dartre, Ferey, Loughty,
 with the little territory 
Do∣nemain.
 The 
mac Mahons,
 that is, the sons of 
Ursus,
 or the Bear, were powerfull, but through dissention among them∣selves, and their rebellious practises, are rooted out: the 
Blanys
 are Barons of this place.


The County of 
Armagh
 lieth towards the east in length, compassed with the River 
Neury
 by East, with the County of 
Louth
 by South, and with the 
Blackwater
 by North. So fruitfull and fat a soyle, that if any compos or dung be laid on it in scorne of it, it becomes barren.


The first place is 
Fewes,
 a small territory belonging to 
Turlogh mac Henry,
 one of the Family of 
Oneal,
 thick set with wood, and by reason of the lakes and bogs impassible.


Next is 
Orry,
 in want of wood, where dwelt 
O Hanlon,
 and where stands 
Mont Norris,
 built by the Lord 
Mont∣joy:
 and 
Ansley
 are Barons of 
Mont-norris;
 eight miles off


neere the River 
Kalin
 lyeth 
Armagh,
 a poore town, yet an Archbishops See, and Metropolitan, the first Archbishop was Saint 
Malachie,
 much commended by Saint 
Bernard,
 yet nevermore happy than in the enjoying of that learned and right reverend Prelate Doct. 
Usher,
 now Archbishop, whose learning and piety is well known, and shews that an Archbishop and religious, though not always convertible, yet sometimes compatible. This towne in the last Rebel∣lion was ruinated by 
Tyrone.
 The chiefe men are 
mac Genis O Hanlan,
 and many of the Sept of 
O Neal,
 which assume unto themselves severall by-names. The 
Blackwater
 East∣ward runneth betweene this Shire and 
Tiroen:
 the 
Cha∣worths
 have the dignity of Vicount from this place.


The County of 
Down
 lyeth Eastward on the Irish Sea, long and broad, on the North to the Lake 
Eaugh,
 and on the South to the County of 
Louth,
 from which it is seve∣red by the river 
Newry,
 upon which standeth a town called 
Bagnall,
 in remembrance of that noble Marshall of 
Ire∣land,
 Sir 
Richard Bagnall.
 Neere which town the River 
Banthelesse
 ariseth out of the mountains of 
Mourne,
 passing thorow the country of 
Eaugh,
 which pertains to 
mac Genis,
 it hath a Bishops See at 
Dromore;
 above which are the tracts of 
Kilwalto & Kilwarny
 much incumbred with woods and bogs, and lye inwardly: But by the shore the Sea doth winde in, and incroach upon the land, and makes many creeks, and the Lake spreadeth it selfe neere 
Dyffrin,
 a val∣ley full of woods: anciently the 
Mandavils,
 afterward the 
Whits,
 so that it makes two Bilands, 
Lecall
 Southward, and 
Ardes
 Northward. 
Lecall
 very rich and battle ground, run∣neth farthest into the East of any part of 
Ireland,
 and is the out-most Promontory, called S. 
Johns Foreland:
 the 
Crom∣wels
 are intitled Vicount 
Lecall.
 In the very streight hereof lyeth 
Down,
 a very famous town, and a Bishops See, where Saint 
Patricks
 Tombe is said to be.


By the Sea side stands 
Argl
s,
 where S. 
Patrick
 founded a Church, and 
Strangford
 formerly called 
Strandford,
 where there is a safe harbour, at which the River 
Coyn
 with a violent course breaketh into the Sea from an honourable Family of the 
Smiths
 in 
Kent
 have the dignity of Vicount 
Strangford. A
des
 the other Biland called 
Audes,
 lyeth o∣ver against 
Lecall
 to the North, parted with a small chan∣nell out of the Lake 
Coyn,
 which on the West side inclo∣seth it, as the sea doth on the East, and the Bay of 
Knocfergus
 on the North; the soyle is good and fruitfull, save only in the middest where it is moist and waterish plain; the shore is replenished with many small Villages; Vicount 
Mount∣gomery
 hath his title from 
Ardes.
 At the Bay of 
Knocfergus
 there was an ancient Monastery of the same Order and name with that neere 
Chester,
 to wit, 
Banchor.
 More in∣ward neer the Lake is the Bishops See of 
Conereth
 or 
Co∣ner,
 whose Pastor was devout, but his flock wicked, as Saint 
Bernard
 describes them. 
Ardes
 was large in the possession of the Savages, one of whom was perswaded to build a Fort for his safeguard, made answer that he would not trust to a Castle of stones, but of bones, meaning himselfe and men. Above 
Ardes
 to the South-west lyeth 
Clanbay,
 that i
, the yellow nation, a County full of woods, reaching to 
Knocfergus,
 the farthest part of 
Down,
 inhabited by the Fa∣mily of the 
Oneals:
 the Popes are Earles of 
Down,
 and Ba∣rons 
Bealter
erts.


The County of 
Antrim
 lyeth next in order unto 
Louth
 Northward, taking its name from a poore despicable town so called, and is seated in an out-corner of 
Ireland
 towards 
Scotland
 within three hours saile, and is limited with 
Knoc∣fergu
, Logh, Eaugh,
 and the river 
Ban:
 the 
mac Donels
 are Earls of 
Antrim. Knocfergus,
 in Irish 
Cangfergus,
 that is, the rock of 
Fergus,
 where a famous man of that name was drowned▪ that place is well inhabited, and more frequen∣ted


than the rest of that country, by reason of a good and commodious harbour, well fortified and strong: Vicount 
Chichester
 hath his title from it. Hard by lyeth the nether 
Clanboy
 possessed by the 
O Neals,
 untill their rebellion in the queens time: now the 
Hamiltons
 are stiled Vic: 
Clanb
y
 from this or the like place: neer 
Knocfergus
 there is a little Biland which runs out into the sea, is called the Ile 
Magie,
 four miles in length, and one in bredth, where was a Mona∣stery of that name, highly praised by venerable 
Bede.
 Then begins the 
Glins,
 that is, the Vallies at 
Olderfleet,
 which is a bad road, and run out far into the sea: this place was for∣merly much annoyed with the Ilander 
Scots,
 under the lea∣ding of 
James mac Conel,
 Lord of 
Cantire
 in 
Scotland;
 but 
Shan O Neale
 slew him, and chased away his army. About this place, as far as the river 
Ban,
 is called the 
Rowt,
 the seat of the 
mac Guillies,
 a well esteemed Family. 
Dunluse
 castle, a strong one, seated on a rock that hangeth over the sea, the possessions of 
Surley Boy,
 that is, 
Charles
 the 
Yellow,
 who re∣belled and was so chased by captain 
Meriman,
 his son slain, his cattell taken away, of which he had a great stock of 50000 Cows. So that he made his submission, and was re∣ceived into the queens favour, and had a fair estate given unto him again upon some articles of agreement.


The county of 
Colran
 is beyond the 
Glinns
 westward, and lyeth between the river 
Ban
 and 
Lough Foyle,
 and confineth South, on the county of 
Tir-Oen.
 This 
Ban
 is a passing fair river, & riseth out of the Mountains of 
Mourn
 in the coun∣ty 
Down,
 carrying himself, and his name into 
Lough Eaugh,
 or 
Lough Sidney,
 a great lake; and for the space of 30 miles, name and river are both drowned in the Lake; but after at 
Tome
 Castle he resumeth it again, then by 
Glaucolkein,
 a great receptacle of robbers and rebels; carrying a proud stream, he tumbleth into the Sea: More abounding in Sal∣mons this, than any river in 
Europe,
 it being exceeding water


in which such fish much delight. The principall Family is 
O Cahan
 a subject of 
O Neal,
 who in that vain ceremony of 
O Neals
 election, flings an old shoe over 
O Neals
 head. It is much molested by the Iland 
Scots,
 being poor, so that in Summer they seek for booty here. Towards the west of this lies 
Derry,
 a waste uncivil place, but through the great care, charge and industry of the City of 
London,
 so well planted, civilized and built, that it is scarce inferior to any place of 
Ireland;
 and have rightly named it 
London Derry:
 the 
Ridg∣ways
 being Earles thereof, as 
Hu
h Hare
 was Lord 
Colrane
 of 
Colrane.
 There is likewise a Bishop of 
Derry.


The County of 
Tir-Oen
 lyeth Southwest from the for∣mer country; it is upland from the sea, divided westward from 
Tir Conell
 by the river 
Liffer,
 from 
Antrim
 Eastward by 
Lough Eaugh,
 & bounded with the 
Blackwater,
 at South from the county 
Armagh
 a rough rugged uneven country 60 miles in length, and at some places 30 in bredth, severed by the Mountains called 
Sliew Gallen
 into the upper 
Tir-Oen
 Northward, and the nether Southward: there is first a poor Bishops See, called 
Cloghar,
 then 
Dungannon
 the chief ha∣bitation of the Earls, also 
Uhlogahel,
 where O 
Neal
 the Ty∣rant of 
Ulstor,
 was usually installed with his vain ceremo∣nies: there was a Fort at 
Blackwater
 which hath been much assaulted by the Rebels which resort thither to a refuge; but having found another passage over below that is of such use; therfore the Lord 
Montjoy
 built Sconces on both sides of that passage; and at the Lake 
Eaugh
 raised another Gar∣rison Fort, and called it by his own name, 
Mountjoy.
 This Lake incloseth the west-side of 
Tir-Oea,
 and is much sup∣plyed by the River 
Ban;
 a large lake 30 miles in length, and very plentifull in fish. And Nature hath shewed her skill in bestowing variety upon the banks of it, as the shady grove
, the medows alwayes green, the fertile corn-fields, if tilled, the bending and hanging hills; the warbling Brook


gliding along it, nothing wanting for delight or profit, and by that condemns the lazy lithernesse of the inhabitants, who suffer much of it to lye waste. In the upper 
Tir-Oen
 lyes 
Strahan,
 a Castle well known, as being the seat of the 
O Neals
 there are many more fortresses and towers with narrow loop-hooles, unto which are adjoyned houses of turf and thetch, with hedges and ditches round about, to keep their Cows from robbers.


The County of 
Donegall,
 or 
Tir-Conell,
 it lyeth in the norwest corner of 
Ireland,
 a champion country full of Ha∣vens, bounded with the sea North and West, and parted on the East from 
Tir-Oen
 with the river 
Liffer;
 and from 
Co∣nagh
 with the Lake 
Erne. Liffer
 at his very rising maketh a large stream, and spreadeth into a Lake, wherin is an Iland, in which neer to a Monastery is a narrow vault made by 
U∣lisses
 (as some fabulously report) when he descended to hel; the inhabitants call it 
Ellan
 a 
frugadory,
 that is, the Ile of Purgatory, and Saint 
Patricks
 Purgatory: So in that place there is Saint 
Brendans
 Purgatory, of which much super∣stition is invented: this river 
Liffer
 neerer the sea, it maketh another Lake, called 
Logh-foile,
 or 
Logh Der;
 and 
Derry,
 of which I spake before, bounds on it. From this river the 
fitz-Williams
 take their Barony. Here is the fair foreland a pro∣montory 
Robogh,
 with a small town having a B
 See. From hence Westward runs a cragged shore unto the mouth of 
Swilly
 lake; & so to the utmost promontory, which they cal the 
Rams-head,
 to another promontory cald▪ S. 
Helens-head.


More Southward on the shore is that good and com∣modious Haven 
Calebig,
 whence you may see the ruines of 
Sligah
 castle.


A little lower, not far from the mouth of 
Logh Erne
 is 
Donegall,
 that is, the town of the 
Gallirians
 in 
Spain,
 the Earldoms have been to the 
O Donels,
 who held it untill their rebellious hearts cast off all true obedience.


Thus hast thou seene, courteous Reader, the limbs and parts of the Kingdom of 
Ireland,
 laid open unto thee rich and plentious, as appears by those large revenews it hath yeelded unto the English Crown, when as in King 
Edward
 the third his dayes some say forty thousand pounds yearly, the Custome-house at this time duly payd into the Exche∣quer, is thirty thousand pound 
per annum.
 And great was that improvidence (if I may say it) both in civill govern∣ment and Church discipline, that have suffered those fire∣brands of the Christian world, the Jesuites, to raise there so sudden and great flame of Rebellion, which wee hope (by Gods providence, working with the wisdom and pru∣dence of this present State now assembled) to see extinct; to the utter ruine and overthrow of that bloudy religion of Popery; and by this means so to root out, and disperse those unconstant and various dispositions, that all hope of ayde and assistance from others, and opposition in them∣selves shall be quite taken away.


And further, by this description mayest thou observe how to entertaine the present profer, made by the honoura∣ble Houses of Parliament to thy best contentment and ad∣vantage; how to get sure footing in an Iland so great, so neere a neighbour to 
England,
 so fruitfull in soil, so rich in pasture more than credible; beset with shady; plea∣sant, profitable woods, inriched with many minerals (if sought after) watered with so many Rivers, invironed with so many commodious Havens, lying so fit and open for sailing into the most wealthy Countreys, so that he will seeme short witted (whose wealth will bear it) that em∣braces not the present opportunity to inrich himselfe in a plantation of his posterity, in the middest of such worldly felicity.




The end of the first part.








The second Part treating of the naturall Disposition, Apparell, and Dyet of the 
Irish,
 and of their severall Rebellions.


T
He Irish for the most part are proud & haugh∣ty, cruell and barbarous, variable and in∣constant in disposition, apt and forward to Tumults, rebellious to Government, false and hollow-hearted, more ready in promise then performance, the meaner lazie, idle, and sluggish especially the wild Irish, and the English Irish much degenerated.


Saint 
Bernard
 in the life of 
Malla Ehy
 Bishop of 
Coner,
 who reports that when he undertook his charge there, perceived that he was not come unto men but unto beasts, no where had he until then experience of such, in the most barbarous parts that ever hee came unto: no where had hee found for Manners so froward, for Rites so devillish, for Faith so impious, for Laws so barbarous, for Discipline so stiffe∣necked, & for Life so filthy. Christians they were in name, but Pagans in deed, lawfull Marriages they contracted none, or such as are shamefull even with children of ten yeeres old.


So 
Langfrank
 complains to a King of Ireland, 
Therdel
c
,
 that the Irishmen forsake and leave their Wives at their


pleasure without any just cause, and marry any others, even such as be neer of kin to themselves, or to the said forsaken wives: and if an other man with like wickednesse hath cast off his wife, her likewise with like rashnesse they joyn with∣all.


With which Rites if this Nation of the Irish had not bin corrupted almost to our days, both the right of lineall suc∣cession among them had been more certain, and as well the Gentry as the vulgar had not embrued themselves so wic∣kedly with the effusion of so much bloud of their own kin∣red about their inheritance and legitimation, nor had they become so infamous in these respects among other for∣reigne Nations.


And further concerning their natures and disposition, you may take the relation from the Earle of 
Essex
 his Let∣ter to Q▪ 
Elisabet
 gathered by his experience.


The people in generall have able bodies by nature, and have gotten by custome ready use of armes, and by their late successe, boldnesse to fight with your Majestis forces.


In their pride they value no man but themselves, in their affections, they love nothing but idlenesse and licentious∣nes, in their Rebellion, they have no other end but to shake off the yoke of obedience, to root out all remembrance of the English Nation in that Kingdome. This is the generall quarrell of the Irish, and they who doe not professe it, are either so few, or so false, that there is no account to be made of them.


The Irish Nobility and Lords of Countries do not only in their hearts affect this quarrell, and are divided from us in Religion, but have an especiall grudge against the Eng∣lish Government, because it limiteth and tyeth them, who have and still would be supream Lords, if not Tyrants. The Towns being inhabited by men of the same Religion and


birth with the rest, are so carried away with the love of gaine, and for that cause supply the Rebels with what they want: therefore they must be strictly looked unto.


The Laws of the Irish was that of fish and birds, the great devoure the lesse, the strong the weak, having but one Free-holder in a County, and he Lord both of estate and lives of the rest.


For their succession to inheritances, it was by the law or custome called 
Tanistry,
 mentioned by that excellent Hi∣storian Sir 
Walter Rawleigh:
 which is this, that a man is pre∣ferred to a boy: the Uncle before the Nephew, and com∣monly the most active, not the next heire is chosen, to hin∣der the inroad and oppression of the next adjoyning Lord, between whom there was alwayes contention, which did so wast and consume them, or else being idle, the Land would not have sustained them.


Concerning the apparell of the Irish it is after a slovenly manner, and the very English, there are much infected with this nasty filthinesse, especially lowzie beds, and foule lin∣nen, except where the chiefe English live, as in Dublin, Wa∣teford, and Kinsale, which in some measure retaine the English neatnesse; but for the meere wilde Irish it may be said of them as of the Germans, that they wander slovenly and naked, and lodge in the same room with their cattle.


Among them the better sort used to weare close bree∣ches and stockings of the same, of red or some light co∣lour, so straight that the unseemly parts of the body were exposed unto view.


They used likewise a loose Coat and a three covered Mantle of coarse cloth, with a cap of Thrums.


Their linnen is coarse and slovenly, they seldome cast off a shirt untill it be rotten, and are coloured with Saffron to avoid Lice which are incident to those people, and they are


very nimble in taking Lice in a Sunny day, or a green bank.


But in the more Northern parts before the strict civili∣zing of them in King 
James
 his time, both men and women went naked in the very Winter, having only their secret parts covered with a rag and a loose Mantle cast over them.


Thus naked they walke with their sword tyed unto them with a wyth instead of a belt.


And at night men and women lye in a Ring together, round about the fire, in the middle of the roome with their feet towards it, folding their head and upper parts in their woollen Mantle first steeped in water to keep them warm, for they say, woollen wetted, and warmed by the heat of their bodies, doth preserve heat.


The Church Discipline hath beene formerly and now is after the same manner with that in England, by Arch∣bishops, whereof there are foure, Bishops 29, many more formerly.


It has beene anciently a great Nursery of Religion and Pietie: even from (if not before) Saint 
Patricks
 time, and Saint 
Bridget
 his Disciple, who did advance Religion and Piety much in that Kingdome, as also in sundry other pla∣ces of Christendome.


The Bishops were formerly consecrated by the Arch∣bishop of Canterbury, untill the yeere 1142: at what time Pope 
Eugenius
 the fourth, sent Cardinall 
Paperio,
 who to∣gether with 
Christian
 Bishop of Lismore, Legat of all Ire∣land, held a Councell at Mell, and with the consent of the Bishops, Abbots, Kings, and Dukes of Ireland, established foure Archbishops, 
videlicet
 Armagh, Dublin, Cassile, and Toam. But the estate of the Clergy has been very meane there, so that by reason of devouring impropriations in the whole County of Connought. The Incumbents stipend is not above forty shillings, and at some places but fifteene


shillings 
per annum,
 that the people must needs be better fed then taught.


Their allowance being answerable to the Irish Bishops in former time, who had but three milch Kine allowed them, and when one was dry, the Parish did change her for another.


Which makes the Gospell to languish where it finds so poore entertainment; that the Messengers thereof through▪ want and necessity should live so mean and contemptibly: and it gives great advantage to the Priests and Jesuits both to abound and seduces who have mayntenance from else∣where.




The right and title of the English Crown to Ireland was by Conquest, by Surrender, and Submission.


THe Danes first invaded it with forreigne forces, then the Norwegians got possession of it; but they were rooted out by the policie of that King of Meth, who had a beautifull Virgin to his daughter, with whom 
Turgesius
 was much inflamed, requiring her to satisfie his lust, to whose will the poore Prince could not assent, yet durst not deny. So that he told him he had at home a Bevy of faire Ladies▪ out of which hee should choose for his pleasure. 
Turgesius
 hearing that, wished these Damsels 
Cupids
 wings for their more speedy arrivall.


But the other attired certaine young men of courage in womens apparell, and had them conducted into the Kings Chamber, from whence all his attendance were comman∣ded, but when hee expected more kinde embraces, hee was suddenly slaine in the place; so the Norwegians were de∣stroyed, and the Irish enjoyed their estate untill the yeere 1172.


When 
Dermet Ma
 Morck
 King of Lemster, having for∣ced the wife of 
Ma
rice O Rork
 King of Meth (a light wo∣man, and with consent) by whose husband the other was pursued so eagerly with the revenging sword; that hee was driven to quite his Kingdome of Lemster, and fly to Eng∣land for succour to 
Henry
 the Second, who very willingly entertained this occasion; who had long sought occasion of getting Ireland.


Yet not willing to entertain it at the first in person (being not a matter of that consequence for himself to undertake)


He gave Dermot licence to draw-what power of Vo∣luntiers he could into that action.


Who applyed himself to Wales, where he found a va∣liant Gentleman of Norman Race, one 
Robert Fitz Stephen,
 who willingly undertook the service with some Voluntiers whose happy and good successe, caused 
Richard
 Earle of 
Pembroke,
 called 
Strong-bow,
 being the principall man in∣vited by 
Dermot,
 and that with the promise of his daugh∣ter and Kingdome in marriage, the Earle himselfe with two hundred men at arms, and a thousand other Souldiers who arrived in the Bay of Waterford 1171, and presently mar∣ched towards the town of Waterford and took it by force the next day, to the exceeding terrour of that Nation.


Dermot
 then accomplishes the match, giving the Earle his daughter 
Eva;
 with which Ring of Mariage he affian∣ced that Island unto this Kingdome: for hee went on with such resolutions, that hee in little space subdued much of Ireland.


Which news being carried unto 
Henry
 the Second, hee made hast over thither, that hee might have the glory of the Conquest, and seemed to be displeased with the Earle for his forwardnesse, and his rigorous using of that people, recalling all from thence, under pain of confiscation of


their goods in England; but the King seemed somewhat ap∣peased before his going over, which was 1172, at which time landing at Waterford, hee imprisoned 
Robert Fitz Ste∣phen,
 as having gone over without his leave, but not long after released him, but took Weiford and other Territo∣ries from him.


Thus did hee receive the homage of divers Irish petty Kings, willing to obtain them by gentle means.


And keeping his Christmasse there in great state, and set∣ling the Government of the Church, hee is unexpectedly called into England, leaving 
Hugh Lacy
 at Dublin.


Who in ensuing time rebelled, and were brought under by King 
John,
 who was the first that planted English Laws and Officers in Ireland, and both annexed that Kingdome and fastned Wales to the Crown of England: and was the first who enlarged the Royall style with Lord of Ireland.


In the yeere 1339, there was a generall warre betweene the English and Irish, wherein many of the Irish perished, after which time matters were quiet untill the eighteenth yeere of 
Richard
 the Second, being 1400.


Who went over then with a great Army, but having ac∣cepted of the Rebels submission he returned into England: during whose time and till the civill warres in England all matters were setled and composed without any charge or assistance out of this Kingdome.


But in the time of the wars between York and Lancaster, wherein many Noble Families were quite extinguished in England, many English came out of Ireland either to take part of possession of some inheritances, which fell unto them by the death of their friends.


So they have but small regard of what they leave behind in Ireland. The meere Irish rushed on the forsaken lands, so that growing rich and proud they began to kick against au∣thority;


willing to cast off the English yoke, and the Eng∣lish Pale had its limits sometime more and sometimes lesse, according as they were able to mayntaine.


But when those civill discords were blown over, and all things became calme by the good successe of 
Henry
 the Se∣venth, and leasure afforded to look towards Ireland, which then harboured a Rebell against him, one 
Perkin Warbeck
 who connterfeited himself 
Richard
 the Third, but was sup∣pressed by the sending over of 1000 men.


Again, 
Henry
 the eighth sent over 500 souldiers to sup∣presse the 
Geraldines
 of English Race.


Afterward, all peaceable, untill Queene 
Elizabeths
 time, when they saw themselves out of hope to plant Popish Superstition in any of her Dominions.


Then Religion (never untill that age) became the cloake for Rebellion, and the Roman Locusts, the incendiaries of Christendome, to mayntaine the Popes usurped authority, breathed every where fire and sword, and worse against her sacred person and Dominions. And taking advantage of the blinde zeale of the ignorant Irish unto Popery: working on their variable condition. Boulstering up their hopes and hearts with that old saying,

He that will 
England
 win, must at 
Ireland
 first begin.

By which means they raised two dangerous Rebellions in that Country.


By the Earle of 
Desmond
 one 1578, the other of 
Tyrone,
 about 1590, plotting and intending, although it brake not out till afterward.


This 
Gerald
 Earle of 
Desmond
 of English Race, whose Progenitours had done good service against the Irish, and borderers of Wales, in the behalfe of the English King, had


the Earldome of Kildare given them, and Earles of 
Des∣mond,
 by 
Edward
 the Third.


But in 
Henry
 the Eighth's days, one of them being Lord Deputy, and questioned for his ill government, on which occasion 
Thomas Fitz Gerald
 his sonne took armes, but was soon suppressed himselfe, and five of his Uncles being ta∣ken and executed.


Queen 
Mary
 restored the Family to honour and estate.


But after 
Gerald
 Earle of 
Desmond,
 1578, rebelled a∣gainst Queene 
Elizabeth
 unto whose aide came certaine bands of 
Italians
 and 
Spaniards,
 sent by Pope 
Gregory
 the twelfth, and 
Philip
 King of 
Spaine,
 who landed at 
Swir∣
ic,
 and built a Fort called 
Del ore,
 wherein they were be∣sieged by 
Arthur Grey
 Lord Deputy of 
Ireland,
 soone taken and put to the sword: And the Earle of 
Desmond
 flying in∣to the Woods, being betrayed by his own followers, and his head cut off. So this fire soon vanished into smoake, and the Earldome by Parliament annexed to the Crowne, and made a County: with Sheriffs appointed yeerly to be cho∣sen by the Lord Deputy.


Upon the Attainder of this Earle and his Confederates, much land fell unto the Crown, 
viz.
 574628 acres English mesure, wherof great part was restored to the offenders, the rest divided into Signories, was granted by Letters Patents unto certaine Knights and Esquires English, who were cal∣led Undertakers.


In 
Kerry
 and 
Desmond,
 by Patent to Knights 30560 A∣cres with yeerly rents 524 pounds, six shillings and eight peace sterling.


In 
Limrick
 by Patent to Knights and Esquites, and to their heirs were granted 96165 Acres, with rents nine hun∣dred thirty three pounds, foure shillings half peny sterling.


In 
Corke,
 by Patent to Knights and Esquires, and to their


heires were granted 88037 Acres, with Rents, five hundred and twelve pounds, seven shillings and six peace half p
ny sterling.


In 
Waterford
 and 
Tipperary
 22910 Acres, with Rents three hundred and three pounds, three pence sterling.


But these Undertakers having got so large a proportion of Lands, and so little care to plant them with English Co∣lonies; and build and fortifie them with Castles as by Pa∣tent they were tied, but for private ends without any regard to the publick good or her Majesties bounty sold them ei∣ther to Papists or to Irish ill affected unto the English, which was a great prejudice to the State of that Kingdom, and the seeds of the ensuing Rebellion raised by 
Tyrone.






Concerning which I will briefly shew unto the Reader such collections as I have gathered from divers Authors.


COncerning the name and title of 
O Neale;
 it is in so much esteeme, that even those honourable titles of Earles, Marquesses, Dukes and Princes are despised in re∣gard of that: and in such reverent regard among the Irish, that it is thought hee deserves the greatest curse in the world to fall upon him that shall dare to lay violent hands upon him: nor have any loyall subjects a more dreadfull awe to violate the person of their sacred Prince, then these people have to touch their great 
O Neale.


So that two thousand pound being offered by Proclama∣tion to any that should betray him in his vast Campe, pre∣vailed nothing at all, although hee were proclaymed Trai∣tour, and held guilty of that crime by Act of Parliament to take that name upon him.


Neere 
T
llogh Oge,
 there was a stone Chaire placed in the open field, wherein he sate down that was created; then


we whose office it was, took an old shooe and cast it over his head, proclayming him 
O Neale.


Henry O Neale
 and 
C
nm
re
 matching into the Family of the Earles of 
Kildare,
 by this their good fortune grew so insolent and proud, that by their cruell tyranny they grew intolerable.


C
n Batto,
 because lame, succeeded his father in the dig∣nity of 
O Neale,
 and cursed his posterity if any of them should learne English, sow corne, or build houses to enter∣tain the English.


This mans greatnesse grew in suspition with 
Henry
 the eighth, having been a party in the former Rebellion of the Earle of 
Kildare:
 which hee perceiving went into 
England,
 renounced the title of 
O Neale,
 and surrendred his Lands unto the King.


Which not long after was regranted unto him by 
Henry
 the eighth to hold in fee, together with the title of the Earl of 
Tyrone
 to him, and to 
Matthew
 his reputed sonne, and to the heires of their bodies lawfully begotten.


At which time also 
Matthew
 was created Baron of 
Dun∣gannon:
 This 
Matthew
 till hee was fifteene yeeres of age, was reputed the sonne of a blacksmith of 
Dundalke,
 whose Wife 
Con
 had formerly kept; and she at her death gave him unto the said 
Con,
 as being his sonne which hee did accept, and appointed him to be Lord of 
Dungannon,
 but hee was murthered in his fathers life time by 
Shant,
 that is, 
John O Neale
 the lawfull heire of 
Con,
 but 
Matthew
 the base sonne left 
Brian
 who was murthered by 
O Donell
 at the instance of 
Shan.


And 
Hugh
 and 
Cormack▪
 who by the means and help of the English were preserved, yet both proved Rebels, 
Shan
 being barbarous and bloudy, did 
ave and rage in a cruell manner over the Lords and people of 
Vlster.


Began to dispute that his father had no power to surren∣der to 
Henry
 the Eighth, being but a termer: that 
Matthe
 was base borne, that himselfe was 
O Neale,
 and had Sovereigne power and authority over the Lords of 
Vlster.


Who taking armes overthrew 
O Really,
 and took 
Callogh O Donnell,
 Lord of 
Tir Conell,
 cast him and his children into prison, took his wife from him, and bore himselfe as abso∣lute King of 
Vlster.


But hee was soone quelled by the forces of the Earle of 
Sussex,
 the then Lord Deputy: and by perswasion of the Earle of 
Kildare,
 went into 
England,
 and made great sub∣mission to Queen 
Elizabeth,
 and promising allegiance, was received courteously.


And so returning conformed himselfe awhile in civill manner, and did some good service against the 
Scots,
 killed their Leader, and drove them out of 
Vlster;
 howbeit hee suddenly fell to his old byas, and played the Tyrant over the Lords of 
Vlster;
 who craved aid of the Lord Deputy to suppresse him; but he grew the more outragious, and with fire and sword drave 
Mac Guir,
 Lord of 
Fermanagh,
 out of his Country: set fire on the Metropolitan Church of 
Ar∣magh,
 and laid siege to 
Dundalke,
 but had the repulse by the Garrison and assistance of the Major.


But Sir 
Henry Sidney
 Lord Deputy, taking the field with some forces: sent 
Edw. Raldalph
 a brave Souldier to the North side of 
Ireland,
 where at 
Derry
 at 
Coghfoyle
 in a pitchfield (though hee lost his life) yet gave the rebell such an overthrow, that he was never able to appeare any more abroad; so that hee was minded to have submitted with a halter about his neck to the Deputy, but by the perswa∣sion of his Secretary hee tried, the friendship of the 
Scots,
 who received him kindly, but not long after slue him.


So that presently after 
Shan
 by a Parliament at 
Dublin,
 was attainted of high Treason; and all that hee had fell to the Queen. Then 
Turlogh, Linnogh,
 took the title off 
O Neal,
 for feare of the children of 
Shan,
 and 
Matthew
 the bastard, but being aged was quiet, and lived peaceably.


Now 
Hugh
 son of the base son 
Matthew
 lived somtime in 
Ireland,
 but much in the Court of 
England,
 commonly cal∣led Baron of 
Dungannon,
 who had served with a troop of horse under the Queen against the Lord of 
Desmond,
 and behaved himselfe so valiantly, that hee had given him a yeerly pension off a hundred marks.


He was a man of mean stature, but of a strange body, able to endure labours, watching, hunger and cold, being indu∣strious and active, valiant, affable, and apt to manage great affaires, and of a hgh dissembling, subtile, and profound wit.


He put up a Petition to the Parliament in 
Ireland,
 that he might enjoy the inheritance of his Grandfather 
Con,
 and his father, granted to be Earles of 
Tirone,
 which by the help of Sir 
John Perrot,
 Lord Deputy, was procured of the Queen.


And so hee handled the matter (as well knowing the hu∣mour of the Court of 
England
) that through the Queenes mediation he got 
Turlogh, Linnogh,
 to surrender his govern∣ment upon some conditions.


After whose death he usurped the title of 
O Neale,
 which was capitall, yet coloured it over with a pretence, that it was only to hinder others.


In the yeer 1588, when that great Armado of 
Spaine
 was scattered by the 
English,
 and many of the ships cast away on the 
Irish
 coast: it is thought that this 
Hugh
 lodging and en∣tertaining many of them, was by them seduced and per∣swaded to Rebellion.


And going into 
England,
 he was there detained prisoner,


for that he came without the licence of the Lord Deputie, Sir 
William Fitz Williams:
 but on submission, and certaine Articles proposed to him by the Lords, and he willingly accepting promising to confirme them before the Lord De∣puty in 
Ireland.


In the yeere 1590, it hapned that 
Con
 the sonne of 
Shan O Neale,
 accused 
Hugh
 of treasonable practices before the Lords in 
England.


All which 
Hugh
 vehemently denied; but after getting his accuser in his power, he hanged him.


In 
August,
 the same yeere 
Hugh
 Earle of 
Tyrone,
 (for so hereafter we must call him, did promise under his hand be∣fore the Lord Deputy: and counsell of 
Ireland
 to performe those Articles agreed upon in 
England,
 but used many ex∣cuses to put off the execution of them.


And about this time 
Hugh Ror Mac Mahone
 was put to death by the Lord Deputy 
Williams
 very unjustly (as some say) to the great scandall of the Lord Deputy; and it cau∣sed great complaints and out-cryes among the 
Irish,
 who presently preferred their grievances against that Deputy▪ and he driven to answer them.


And upon this fact the government of the 
English
 in the North became odious, and they did strive what they could to shake it oft, by expelling the Sheriffs from among them, fearing the like usage as 
M
c Mahone.
 And 1593, 
Mao Guir
 chiefe of 
Fermanagh
 stood upon his guard, accusing the De∣puty of injustice in the businesse off 
Mahone,
 and set upon Captain 
Willis,
 and drove him and his guard being Sheriffe into a Church, and would have put them all to the sword, had not 
Tyrone,
 interceded for them.


Whereupon the Deputy got into his hands 
Eniskillen Mac Guirs
 castle, and proclaimed him a Traytor▪ and like∣wise gave out some hard speeches concerning 
Tyrone,
 which


did much exasperate him, and caused him to combine with the Lords of the North, to defend their Honours, Laws, and Liberties: and used two notable plots to assist him to∣wards this Rebellion.


1 To make his men skilfull, hee profered to serve the Queen with 500 men of his own.


And for that end procured expert Captains to exercise them; and so often changing these his men, got most of his followers to be able Souldiers.


Secondly, hee pretended to build a faire house at 
Dun∣gannon,
 and so got much lead to make Battlements, which after he cast into bullets.


In the meane time Sir 
Henry Bagnal
 Marshall of 
Ireland,
 whose Sister 
Tyrone
 had married, did preferre many Arti∣cles against him, unto which hee answered so cunningly, saying, that the Marshall did it out of spleen of purpose to detain his sisters portion, and seemingly quitted himselfe; but afterward he grew jealous of his owne safety.


At this time 
Gauranus
 a Priest whom the Pope had made Primate of all 
Ireland,
 seduced certaine Irish Lords, among which 
Mac Guir
 was chief, and was overthrowne by Sir 
Richard Bingham,
 and the Priest slaine: in which service 
Ty∣rone
 was against 
Mac Guir
 with the Queens forces▪ but se∣cretly prepared for his Rebellion.


Then the sonnes of 
Shan O Neale,
 were prisoners in 
Du∣blin
 Castle, which had they been kept, had been a bridle in 
Tyrones
 mouth; but by connivance of Sir 
William Fitz Wil∣liams
 the Deputy, were suffered to escape, and so 
Tyrone
 got them into his custody, nor would he release them although thereunto required.


But covering his Rebellion, with feeming feares of his conceived enemies, made daily complaints of the Mar∣shals envy; and what wrong he had done him.


In the yeere 1594, the Rebellion burst out; Sir 
William


Russel
 came in the place of 
Fitz Williams,
 at which time 
Vl∣ster
 men openly distressed her Majesties forces; and 
Tyrone
 was supposed to countenance them.


Yet he appeared in person at 
Dublin,
 before the new Lord Deputy, desiring her Majesties favour, out of which hee had falne, rather by the calumny of them, then any cause of his own.


But the Marshall charged him with great matters, ready to prove them; so that the Deputy thought fit to stay him, but the Councell of 
Ireland
 were of the contrary opinion, so he was let goe, but the Queene was much displeased for it, and sharply reproved the Deputy, but he laid the fault on the Councell of 
Ireland.


And presently tooke the field with his Army to relieve 
Eniskillen
 in 
Ferminaght,
 and in the Winter following, there was little done because there was some Treaties of peace, but the Rebels grew so peremptory in their demands, that it was not liked by the Lords in 
England.


And therefore sent over two thousand old souldiers that had served in 
Britany,
 and a thousand more taken up in 
Eng∣land,
 which news 
Tyrone
 hearing, and that the Castle of 
Balishannan,
 and 
Relike,
 were to be planted with English Ga∣risons. Drew his forces together, and tooke the Fort of 
Blackwater,
 razed it: and broke down the bridge there, and now the Northerne Rebels appeare, but 
Tyrone
 shewed a seeming desire of pardon.


This Lord Deputy fearing this storme might fall upon him, desired the Counsel of 
England
 to send him an assistant of some experienced Souldiers; which hee meant should be under his command; but the Lords mistaking his mean∣ing, sent over Sir 
John Norris,
 a great Commander and well experienced, that would scarce give way to any; who was styled Lord Generall, and to command in chief, in the ab∣sence of the Lord Deputy.


But the emulation that grew between these two hinde∣red the businesse; yet both of them went into the field, with the Army towards 
Armagh.


Tyrone
 makes suit again by Letters for pardon, but being intercepted, came not unto the Deputies hands, untill hee had proclaymed him Traytor.


But upon 
Tyrones
 instance, Commissioners were appoin∣ted by the Queen to treat with the Rebels.


At which time 
Tyrone
 complained of the Marshall of ma∣ny injuries.


And his demands were, that hee might have his Wives portion of the Marshall, and the free exercise of his Reli∣gion, and many other.


But when Articles were propounded on the Queenes part, they set so light of them, and made such scorne, that the Conference brake off: though the Queen for sparing of bloud, had resolved to give them any reasonable Condi∣tions.


This parley ended, the Lord Deputy, and the Lord Ge∣nerall comming to 
Armagh,
 did so much terrifie the Rebels that 
Tyrone
 left the Fort of 
Blackwater,
 burnt the Town of 
Dungannon,
 and pull'd down his house there, and betooke himselfe to the Woods.


Sept.
 the third, 
Hugh
 Earle of 
Tyrone, Hugh O Donel; Brian O Rourk, Hugh Mack Guir, Brian Mac Mahone,
 Sir 
Arthur O Neale, Cormac Mach Baron Tyrones
 brother, 
Con O Neale Tyrones
 base sonne, 
Henry Oge O Neale, Turlogh Mac Henry O Neale, Brian Art Mac Bryan,
 and one 
Francis Mountford
 were (though absent) indicted, and condemned of high Treason.


Now the 
Lemster
 Rebels being revolted grew strong, and forraged even to the gates of 
Dublin,
 to the County of 
Wexford.


This Winter passed without any matter of moment, be∣cause indeed, Generall 
Norris
 not yet acquainted with 
Ty∣rones
 subtilties, seemed to harken to peace, thereby to re∣clayme him by faire means.


In the yeere 1596, the Queen granted another Commis∣sion for the Treaty of Peace, and offered very largely, and at 
Dundalke Tyrone
 upon his knees made an humble submis∣sion to the Queen before these Commissioners, and made many requests, promising reformation, and many circum∣stances and Ceremonies then passed. But these inconve∣niences followed, these delayes being no better then delu∣sions, that the 
Vlster
 Rebels had rest this Summer, and 
O Neale
 in the midst of this Negotiation, required aid from 
Spain.


Sir 
Richard Bingham
 a valiant wise man, on some com∣plaint of the 
Irish,
 was sent for over into 
England,
 and Sir 
Coniers Clifford
 sent in his place: but afterwards Sir 
Richard
 was againe employed in great command in that service.


Again, an other Treaty of Peace with 
Tyrone,
 who layd the cause of his disloyalty, on the wrongs that were offe∣red him; and so with many dissembling words, oaths, and protestations, making answer to some questions concerning 
Spaine,
 he departed.


This Lord Deputy being recalled into 
England,
 and the Lord 
Bourgh
 or 
Borough
 was sent over in his place, with ab∣solute authority: so that Sir 
John Norris
 was much disheart∣ned thereby: and was thought of purpose for that end sent over by the Earle of 
Essex,
 whom Generall 
Norris
 had di∣pleased by undertaking an action with lesse force then the said Earle required.


At this Dep▪ arriving Generall 
Norris
 was commanded to his charge, which was Lord President of 
Munster,
 and not to stirre thence without leave, which thing did present∣ly


break his heart, so that he died there in the armes of his brother Sir 
Thomas Norris.


Now 
Tyrone
 submitted or sweld as he saw occasion.


So that the Lord Deputy perceiving it presently, made his way towards 
Tyrone,
 thinking it best to strike at the head; who encountred the 
Irish
 in a narrow path, and made them give way: hee tooke the Fort at 
Blackwater,
 and left Souldiers in it, which being not long, after assailed by the Rebels, was againe relieved by the Lord Deputy, who im∣mediatly fell sick, as hee was passing to 
Tyrones
 house at 
Dungannon;
 and not long after departed this world, to the great joy of the Rebels, who found his severity disadvan∣tagious to them.


Then Sir 
Thomas Norris,
 Lord President of 
Munster,
 under the great Seale of 
England,
 was made Lord Justice of 
Ireland,
 who repaired to Dublin; but being very ill through the great grief he conceived for the losse of his brother in a moneths space, he made suit to be released.


So that 
Adam Loftus
 Lord Chancelour, the Lord Arch∣bishop of 
Ireland,
 and 
Robert Gardiner
 chiefe Justice of 
Ire∣land,
 by Patent from 
England,
 were made Lord Justices for the Civill Government.


And the Earle of 
Ormond,
 was made Lord Lievtenant and chief Generall of all Martiall affaires.


Tyrone
 again sues for pardon, and proffers submission, saying, that it was offered injuries that compelled him thus to revolt: So there was another meeting appointed at 
Dundalke Decemb.
 22. where on his knees hee shewed great sorrow; and made humble submission, desiring a cessation from Armes eight weeks, now this submission being sent into 
England,
 the Lord Lievtenant received authority from the Queen to make a finall conclusion; so that another mee∣ting was appointed, 
March
 15 at 
Dundalke;
 where many ar∣ticles


were propounded to the Rebels, which they slightly regarded; but for better deliberation, 
Tyrone
 desired the tenth of 
April,
 for another meeting.


But 
Tyrone
 with pretences did frustrate all these parleys, and though hee had his generall pardon granted, yet conti∣nued he in his disloyall courses; so that on the former In∣dictment 1595, he is after out-lawed in 1600.


But he being prepared and his men expert, by trayning and often skirmishing, whereas at the first two or three of them were employed in the discharge of a Musket, hee left off to dissemble and submitted no more, but gives incou∣ragement, and that with good successe unto his Confede∣rates.


First, he sends ayde to the 
Lemster
 Rebels to annoy the English, and assaulted the Fort of 
Blackwater;
 as being a hinderance in his passing too and fro.


But Captaine 
Williams
 valiantly defended it with great losse to 
Tyrone,
 who went and lay further off, but this Cap∣taine and his Company continued their defence bravely untill 
August,
 though much pinched with want of victuals: when Sir 
Henry Bagnal
 Marshall of 
Ireland
 with foot and horse of the English endeavoured to relieve it, and passing along the narrow passages through the thicke Woods be∣yond 
Armagh.


Where the Rebell with all his force assayled him, and bearing a deadly hatred and malice against the Marshall, against whom he bent his whole strength, and commanded his Souldiers so to doe, that he had the fortune to kill him; yet like a valiant Gentleman he sold his life at a deare rate, to many of the Rebels. But his fall caused our mens hearts to fayle; whereupon the Rebell had the greatest advantage against the English: the like never hapning againe, called The Defeat at 
Blackwater.



wherein we lost thirteen valiant Captains, and fifteen hun∣dred old Souldiers: whereupon likewise the surrender of the Fort ensued.


It was thought this misfortune to happen from an over∣sight of the Marshall, who made the Van of the army too suddenly to retreat; and too sudden faces about, puts feare in the Reare; and makes them suppose it may be a running away.


For as Sir 
Walter Raleigh,
 in his fifth book & first part of the History of the World, that as well in the Wars of these la∣ter ages as in former times it hath been found ever extreame dangerous to make a Retreat in the head of an enemies army: as he renders the reason, but I cannot digresse any further.


This overthrow much increased the insolencie of the Re∣bels, the Rebells having gotten courage and armes thereby, and 
Tyrone
 termed the Deliverer of his Countrey, and the authour of their liberty.


All 
Vlster
 in Rebellion, 
Connagh
 revolted, and the Rebels in 
Lemster
 a continuall terrour and vexation to the English.


And now 
Tyrone
 sent forces into 
Munster,
 where after the departure of Sir 
John Norris,
 most of the County revolted, and now brake out like Lightning, making havock, and de∣stroying in a barbarous manner. And for the better counte∣nancing of the matter, a new pretended Earle of 
Desmond
 is set up, on condition to be Vassall to 
O Neale.


At this time a supply came out of 
England,
 of a thousand and fifty old Souldiers from out the Low Countreys, and nine hundred and fifty joyned to them of new, raised in 
Eng∣land,
 sent under the command of Sir 
Samuel Bagnal
 Colonel, and nine other Captains to strengthen the Queenes forces i
 
Lemster,
 and a hundred under Colonel 
Bagnals
 command.


In the midst of these broyls, the impudent Rebell is no



ashamed to intreat for pardon, and sue for peace.


Although, as appeared in his Letters sent to the King of 
Spaine,
 he magnified his victories, and vowed perseverance: but his conditions were insolent and so not regarded.


And now the wound is growne so great, and the case so desperate that it admits of no cure, but by the hand of a va∣liant expert souldier.


And none found like 
Robert
 Earle of 
Essex,
 whom favour with the Queen, and fortune of warre had made popular.


And his own active inclination, and the policie of his powerfull enemies in Court, wrought it for his underta∣king; and by his absence they plotted his ensuing over∣throw.


But before his going two Regiments of old Souldiers out of the Low Countries were sent into 
Ireland,
 and dispersed at his comming through the whole army, for the exercise of the rest.




1050 Foot.


The first Regiment Sir 
Charles Percy
 Co∣lonell.


Richard Morison
 Lievtenant Colonel, and five other Captains.






950 Foot.


The second Regiment, Sir 
Henry Bockwra,
 Colonell.


Captaine 
John Chamberlaine
 Lievtenant Colonell, and four other Captains.




This Earls Commission was large, without limitation al∣most even the power of a Prince, and an army as great as hee desired, the like unto which in all points 
Ireland
 ne∣ver saw.






The establishment was sealed by the 
Qu. March 24, 1598.
 It contained the pay of the chief officers of the Army.

To which adde the establishment, 277782l. 15s.


The totall of the yeerly charge was 299111l. 3s. 7d.


To which if you adde the great charge of all Forts, of Mu∣nitions, with the like extraordinary expences, and consider that the 1300 horse, and the 1600 foot by new supplyes were to be made up 20000.




What a masse of expence is here in one yeere, able to drain this Kingdome, seeing nothing comes from 
Ireland
 but complaints.


It will require the wisdome and providence of those that undertake it, and the patience of the people that beare it.


All this in a readinesse, the Earle of 
Essex
 departs from 
London
 in 
March
 1
99, in the beginning of the yeere, not


providently foreseeing what a step hee then made to his ruine.


The Nobility and gallant Gentry accompanied him on his way.


And the Earle of 
Kildare
 made such haste in an ill Ves∣sell, that himselfe and many a brave man with him were all drowned in the passage.


The Earle being arrived in 
Ireland,
 took the place of go∣vernment, and laboured to acquaint himself with the estate of that Kingdome, what parts were quiet, what in rebel∣lion,

Concerning which in 
April,
 the Earle of 
Essex
 sent intel∣ligence into 
England
 by a Letter.


And in a second Letter of the resolutions of 
Tyrone;
 first, that he intended to hearten his Confederates, and then to make head in 
Vlster
 with his own forces, and 
O Donnel
 in 
Con∣nagh,
 that the Rebels had taken oath at a publick Crosse to be constant, and none 
ought pardon but in such insolent manner, that it was rather a contempt.


That the very subjects grew cold in the service, that al∣though on private revenge they could appeare with an 100. Horse, and 300▪ Foot, yet now pleaded their inability to ayd the Queen with sixe of each; the Earle gathered some Eng∣lish forces together, and against his owne advice in 
England,
 and the Q. command (deceived by some false counsell) hee set not on the head, but on a few weake Rebels in 
Munster,
 a matter of no consequence, being beaten as they were.


June
 15. the Lord Lievtenant received Letters from a Captain out of the North of 
Vlster,
 that 
Tyrone
 had received Amunition out of 
Spaine,
 but no treasure (as was reported) that he did sollicite the Redshanks into his pay, and had pro∣vision of armes, and other assistance daily from the Scots.


And also advised the Earle of their strength, and of their intention to protract the warre, and weary the English; in prevention whereof he wished his Lordship to procure foure thousand Redshanks which in their Boats might break in up∣on 
Tyrone,
 which thing the Lord 
Bourgh
 had formerly under∣taken to procure, but was prevented by death.


Iu.
 25. the Lord Lievtenant wrote unto the Queen of the state and condition of the Rebels, shewing the cause of their rebellion, with the meanes to reduce and keepe them in sub∣jection, and that as well by Sea as Land provision must bee made to reduce them: and afterward gives such direction to her Majestie, as was followed in the ensuing warre, though himselfe had not the good hap to put it in practice.


And in the conclusion bewayles his owne misfortune, that his enemies (whom he names) had gotten so neere her Ma∣jesties elbow.


In the end of 
July
 his Lordship brought backe his forces into 
Lemster,
 himselfe going to 
Dublin,
 having done little, but admitted some few to protection, which afterward re∣volted againe.


In his absence 600. souldiers which were left in the 
Glinne
 had been beaten by the Irish, for which his Lordship used great severity in punishing of them, putting to death the tenth common souldier, calling the Captaines to a Court Marshall, caused an Irish Lievtenant to be shot for parlying with the Rebels.


By this time the Qu. advertised his Lordship of his errour in not setting on the chiefe Rebell 
Tyrone,
 but he excused him∣selfe, and layd the fault on the Counsell of 
Ireland,
 and that his intention now was that way beat, but yet that first hee must suppresse some neere 
Dublin:
 which being done, he took a view of his Army, and found it so much impaired, that hee sent to 
England
 for supply of 1000. new men to inable him presently to undertake the 
Vlster
 journey. And now resolved to march Northwest, he willed Sir 
Conyers Clifford
 Governour of 
Connagh,
 to compell 
Tyrone
 to give resistance at 
Belike,
 while himselfe set on him on the other side.


So that Sir 
Con. Clifford
 with one Troop of horse, and 1400. foot came to the Curlew Mountaines, where he left his car∣riages under the guard of his Horse, untill he had tryed the passage forward,


Who was presently assaulted by the Rebels, taking the advantage of the woods, boggs, and a stony Causey, and al∣though the English stoutly received the charge, yet they be∣ing weary with a long march, and their powder fayling them which they had about them, they began to faint & so to flye; so that many were slain in the place, and many hurt, besides two worthy Commanders, Sir 
Con. Clifford, Alexand. Rat∣cliffe,
 killed: And had not Sir 
John Jepson
 valliantly succou∣red them with his Horse, most of the rest had perished: this happened by a great oversight (as was thought.)


By this time the 1000. men out of 
England
 were arrived in 
Ireland,
 yet his Lordship wrote over that he could doe little


this yeere, but only goe to the borders of 
Vlster,
 whether going in September, 
Tyrone
 shewed himselfe two dayes to∣gether on severall hills some distance off, whence hee sent to desire a parley with his Lordship.


Who rejected that offer, & also sent him word, that on the morrow he should find him armed in the head of his Army.


The next day after a light skirmish, one of 
Tyrones
 horsmen cryed that 
Tyrone
 would not fight, but would speake with the Lord Lievtenant apart from the Army unarmed.


The next day also he was told, that 
Tyrone
 desired the Qu. mercy, and would faine speake with his Lordship at the foard 
Balla. El
nch,
 neere the chiefe towne of the County of 
Louth.


Where they two only met, and 
Tyrone
 saluted his Lord∣ship very courtly, many speeches passing betweene them.


Whether (as being left not farre off) his Lordship cal∣led sixe or seven of his chiefe Commanders, and 
Tyrone
 as many of his friends: and there was a Conference about a Treaty of peace, and a truce made from sixe weekes to sixe weekes, untill May, with proviso that on 14. dayes warning given on either side, it should be lawfull to resume armes againe.


Now, the Queen having received his Lordships Letters what he had done, which was nothing with such an Army in so long space.


She wrote him a tart Letter, much blaming his proceed∣ings, and questioning his discretion.


Which did so gaule and wring his Lordship, that pre∣sently he left 
Adam Loftus,
 the Archbishop of 
Dublin,
 and Sir 
George Carew
 Treasurer of the wars to governe 
Ireland,
 so went into 
England.


And unexpected presented himselfe before the Qu. in her


privy Chamber, but had not that welcome that hee expe∣cted, and after a few words was commanded to his Cham∣ber, and afterwards to the Lord Keepers house in the nature of a Prisoner.


And now a list of the Commanders, and whole Army is taken and set downe both horse and foot, how disposed of throughout the whole Kingdome, and were 14422. Foote 1231. horse.


The truce continuing the helme was easily held by those hands in which it was put, but 
Dec. 6. Tyrone
 began to pra∣ctize acts of hostilitie upon that he had given (as hee said) 14. dayes warning, and because the Earle of 
Essex
 was im∣prisoned in 
England,
 on whom he did relye for safety, and would not now trust the Counsell of 
Ireland,
 that had so often deceived him before, this intelligence posted into 
England,
 that the Rebels were ready to assaile the 
Pale.


And a false rumour raysed by 
Essex
 enemies, that 
Eng∣land
 would suddenly be in a combustion, which was no lit∣tle prejudice to the said Earle.


The Queen hearing this and more, that the Rebels daily increased, and the English Irish discontented that the go∣vernment was wholly out of their hands, by sending Eng∣lish Deputies over.


That 
Tyrone
 grew proud, bearing trust on the King of 
Spaine,
 who had sent him somewhat, but promised more; and the Pope not wanting in his fatherly cate towards him, sent him a crowne of Phenix feathers, in imitation no doubt of 
Vrban
 the third, who sent King 
John
 Lord of 
Ire∣land
 a crowne of Peacocks feathers.


Upon this Sir 
Charles Blunt,
 Lord 
Montjoy,
 is thought fit to be sent, and was thought on by the Qu. before 
Essex
 came over, who was forward to take the charge upon him, and so turned the Queenes intentions▪


This Lord was a tall comely man, wise, valiant, and lear∣ned, close in his counsels, resolute in his determinations.


His courses were much contrary to other Deputies, and so effected what they could not doe.


1. He led our men warily on any service, not willing to dis-hearten our men, or incourage the enemie; and himselfe ever at hand, either to hearten or helpe, hee ventured his own person often, although it be a great question in Mili∣tary discipline, whether it be wisedome or no.


2. His planting of Garrison in the Rebels countreys compassing 
Tyrone
 on every side, so that they could not ea∣sily assist on the other.


Other Deputies made two or three journeys in the yeare, and that with the whole Army; which was discovered by the Rebels, that they fled into the woods and bogges, nor could the Army abide the field long for want of victuals, being so many at one place; where as the Lord 
Montjoy
 planting good Garrisons in many places, taking the field with 1000▪ foot, and 200. horse onely, was able openly to affront 
Tyrone,
 seeing he was compelled to leave many of his forces behind to guard his Countrey from those Gar∣risons, which else would have forraged his Countrey.


Thus he did not only in Summer as others had done, but in Winter also, himselfe being five or sixe dayes in a weeke, on horse-backe, which course did so vexe the Rebels, who were driven to lye in the woods without shelter for them∣selves or cowes, which allowing them not milk, they wan∣ted present provision, nor could they save their corne for the future.


4. Againe, he had a speciall care to cut the passages open and plaine, that our forces might the more secure meet to∣gether.


5. Further, he was not easie to grant Pardons and Pro∣tections,


but to such who had drawne blood on their fel∣lowes, and so lost the hope of reconciliation to the Rebels, and forbad all parlyes with them.


But as the Rebels were many at the Earle of 
Essex
 com∣ming, so now much more increased. In the County of 
Du∣blin
 increased one hundred.


And in many other Countreys, besides five Castles late∣ly taken by the Irish.


In the Province of 
Lemster
 increased 1280. Rebels. In the Province of 
Connagh
 increased 300. Rebels, besides the doubt of 
Tibot ne Longe.


Who had one hundred Irish men in the Queenes pay.


So that now the Enemie strongest, the English weakest, and many other disasters made the businesse very difficult.


In this case the Lord 
Montjoy
 undertooke the businesse about 
Ian.
 1599.


A little before whose comming 
Tyrone
 marcheth out of the North in a vaunting manner unto 
Munster,
 to incou∣rage and countenance the Rebels, but under a religious pretence to visite a peece of the Crosse at a Monastery in 
Tipperary
 County, and so accompanied with the 
Lemster
 re∣bels went on his devotion.


Now the army of English reduced to 12000. foot, & 1200. horse, for whose payment order is given to the Treasurer and Chamberlaine of the Exchequer of 
England,
 to pay the Treasurer of the Warres of 
Ireland,
 after the rate of the former establishment, and other extraordinaries.


So there was signed an establishment by the Queene, 
Ian.
 1. 1599. for the pay of Commanders, and Souldiers.


And the Lord Deputy hasting away for 
Ireland, Ian.
 10. 1599. in his way wrote backe to master Secretary, that he might have more Forces in regard the Rebels were so strong.


A second establishment signed by the Lords, 11. 
Feb.
 1599. wherein every Officers and Souldiers pay, and other charges, the whole yearely charge 14055 pounds, 4 shillings 8 pence, farre short of that allowance which the Earle of 
Essex
 had.


February
 26. the Lord Deputy landed in 
Ireland,
 when Sir 
George Carew
 was made Lord President of 
Munster, Ty∣rone
 did not expect such a sudden arrivall, so that hee was still in West 
Munster,
 where he might be surprised as the Earle of 
Ormond
 thought, if things hapned well.


And that he could not thence escape without engaging himselfe, if the passages were watched.


So that daily newes came that 
Tyrone
 now, or never was to be ruinated: and how many Lords and others of the Irish which were for the Queene had layed waite for him, and would stop his passage back, but all this vanished into Irish ostentation of service, which seldome use to take effect, and many times are not truly intended as this businesse did shew.


And that his Lordship should not expect any helpe from divers of the Nobilitie, and Gentry of the 
Pale,
 they pre∣ferred a Petition to him, that they were not able by reason of the spoyles the souldiers had made upon them, but a meere excuse (as 
Essex
 shewed before.)


Then his Lordship wrote to Secretary 
Cecill,
 to excuse himselfe, for not reducing the 14000 which hee found in the Army unto 12000, and the cause thereof as he had done before.


And upon that receives an answer from the Queen, that she doth accept of his reasons for the present, but would have him effect it by degrees.


And not to entertain many Irish Commanders, who are of small fidelity, and being employed to use them far from


their own countrey, and useth some other advertisements; and so concludeth.


And now for all the great hopes 
Tyrone
 escaped into the North, passing over the Enny in great hast, and marcheth 27 miles in one day: more then he had gone in five before, so that he could not be over-taken.


And at his being there, he sent out a Mandate, by which hee summoned the Subjects of 
Munster
 to appeare before him in this forme.


O Neal
 commendeth himself unto you 
Moris Fitz Thomas, O Neal
 requesteth you in Gods name, to take part with him, and fight for your conscience, and right, and in so doing 
O Neale,
 will spend his life to see you righted in all your af∣faires, and will help you, And if you come not to 
O Neale
 between this and 12 of the clocke tomorrow, and take his part, 
O Neale
 is not beholding to you, and will doe to the uttermost of his power to overthrow you, if you come not to him by Saturday noon at the furthest from 
Knoc Dumain,
 in 
Calrye
 the fourth of 
Feb.
 1599.


O Neale
 requesteth you to come and speak with him, and doth give you his word, that you shall receive no harme, neither in comming or going from him, whether you be friend or not, and bring with you to 
O Neale Gerald Fitz Gerald;
 subscribed 
O Neale.


March
 the 7, the Lord Deputy had intelligence, that 
Ty∣rone
 was come to his house at 
Dungannon,
 and that the Earle of 
Clanrichard
 had sworn, that when his sonne came out off England, in 
May,
 he would enter into action (for so they call Rebellion: and that the Plantation at 
Logh foyle,
 was endeavoured to be hindered by the Rebell.


The 20 of 
March,
 the Secretary informed his Lordship of the relaxation of the Earle of 
Essex;
 who sued earnest∣ly






in his behalfe to the Secretary, even so far as to make his excuse for the matter in 
Ireland.


The Lord Deputy makes a List of his army, about the beginning of the yeare 1600, and casts up the allowances.


Generall Officers for the army as in the former establish∣ment.


Collonels 12 apiece 
per diem,
 10 s.


Twenty six troops of horse, in some more, in some lesse at severall rates of pay in number, 1200.


In 
Loghfoyle
 Garrison 4000 foot.


In 
Carickfergus
 Garrison, 700 foot.


In the Province of 
Connagh,
 1400 foot.


In the Province of 
Munster,
 2950 foot.


In the Province of 
Lemster,
 4500 foot.


Totall of Foot, 1400.


Likewise a List which the Deputy drew out of the Companies formerly mentioned; which lay in 
Lemster, Newry,
 and 
Carbugford,
 for to prosecute 
Tyrone
 in his Coun∣try, horse 325, foot 3200.


Out of these taken to guard places and passages while the Army did return, foot 810, horse 20.


Besides deduct the six dead pays allowed to each Com∣pany of foot, which is 288, and foure out of fifty horse, which is 26, and other deductions of sicke and unsufficient men for service.


There remayns for his army in field, 2102 foot, horse 279 which is but a small handfull for so great a service.


Divers others there were which had pay; as his Lord∣ships chief Chaplain five l. a week, and ten other Preachers at forty shillings a week, his Doctor of Physick five pound a week.


In 
Aprill
 it was consulted about entertayning of 2000 
Scots,
 and that each man should have a Cow for a moneths pay or six pence, 
per diem.


Which businesse was to be furthered by the Queens A∣gent in 
Scotland,
 but it came to nothing being disliked in 
England.


Now the Deputy resolved to pursue the Rebels in many places at once, both by the North Garrisons, and the rest of the Army.


Aprill
 the third, the Lord Deputy sent Master Secre∣tary notice of the falsheartednesse of those that seemed most sure, and that the Irish Commanders were dangerous to keep, yet knew not how to remove them without certain losse of them.


And how he intended to send a thousand old Souldiers out of 
Dublin,
 to 
Loghfoyle,
 and others to lye in Garrison at 
Balishannan,
 both places of great consequence, and proved very advantageous to the English afterwards.


And informed likewise that 
Tyrone
 by his so suddain and hasty flight out of 
Munster,
 had much disheartned many of his Confederates, so that daily the heads of some Rebels or others were brought unto the Deputy.


And the Rebels of Lemster made suit to be received to mercy: only the Towns where the Rebels had to do were very insolent.


And 
Tyrone,
 by the arrivall of two ships, (wherein were many Priests) did incourage his friends. Lastly, the Deputy complained to the Secretary, that all places were bestowed in 
England,
 so that he could gratifie no deserving man.


Further hee sent word that hee doubted of the Earle of 
Ormonds
 constancy to the Queenes cause: and shewed his reasonsa name greatly followed in that Countrey.


In that Province of 
Munster,
 the Rebels were very strong, by reason 
Tyrone
 had been there, and by the aide of 
Mac Carty
 more.


There hapned an ill chance about the time that Sir 
George


Carew
 went to his charge of 
Munster,
 whereof he was Pre∣sident.


Who comming to 
Kilkenney
 in his way from 
Dublin,
 with the Earle of 
Thomond
 in his company, and a hundred horse to attend him; where the Earle of 
Ormond,
 told them that he was to parley with some Rebels of those parts, whereof 
Ow
y M
c Rory
 was chiefe, and requested them to accom∣pany him.


To which they consented and rode eight miles to the place of meeting, with some twenty horse of the Earle of 
Ormonds,
 and a few followers refusing the guard of the Lord Presidents 100 horse, and the Earl of 
Ormond,
 left his two hundred foot two miles short, and with his other com∣pany met with 
Owny,
 who came out of the Woods, leaving five hundred men well appointed not farre off; came up to him with some pikes, but after an houre spent, and nothing agreed on, the Lord President wisht the Earle of 
Ormond
 to returne, but he said hee would first speak with the Jesuit 
Archer;
 and did much revile him, calling him Traytor.


In the mean time the Rebels foot had incompassed, the Earle and his company, and presently tooke the Earle of 
Ormond
 prisoner; and 
Mac Rory
 laid hands on the Lord Pre∣sident: but the Earle of 
Thomound
 rushed on him with his horse, and they both hardly escaped, the Earle of 
Thom.
 be∣ing hurt in the thigh.


The Countesse of 
Ormond
 having one only daughter, was much perplexed and distressed, but the Lord Deputy sent her a Guard for her House.


There were severall conceits upon his surprisall, some supposing it was not against his owne will, but howsoever the Lord Deputy thought it a matter of no great conse∣quence.


The Fort of 
Phillipstown
 in 
Ophaly
 was to be victualled,


and the Rebels gave cut that they would hinder it.


And through the emulation of a great Commander that had another preferred before him, and strengthened by the Court faction in 
England.


It might have miscarried, for the said Commander chose out some weake companies for this service to be led by the other; but the Deputy being advertised thereof, profered them to him that had made the choise of them, but hee re∣fused to goe with them.


And Sir 
Oliver Lambert
 with 14 companyes did with much valour and courage effect the businesse, though strongly opposed.


May
 the fifth, the Lord Deputy makes toward 
Tyrone
 in the North: who had intelligence that he was lodged in the strong Fortresse of 
Coughlurkin
 where the Rebels had for∣tified three miles in length. His Lordship drew towards 
Armagh
 with 1500 hundred foot and two hundred horse, and sent Captain 
Edward Blany
 with five hundred foot, and fifty horse to make good the passage through the 
Moyry
 for the Earle of 
Southampton,
 and Sir 
Oliver Lambert,
 who were to come that way to the Army: and comming to the 
Faghard,
 not far from 
Dundalke,
 whether hee went to the Earle, and told him of the convoy, assuring him that the Lord Deputy would meet him by two of the clocke in the afternoon; hereupon the Earle having with him besides the conuoy, two foot companyes, and fifty horse of Gentle∣men Volunteers: and so marched backe to the dangerous passage of the 
Moyry;
 where the Rebels taking advantage of the Woods and Bogs, assailed our men, lying lurking on both sides, our men being to passe over a Ford.


But by this time the Lord Deputy himselfe was come neere the place, who sent two Regiments, who beat backe the Rebels; who left a few to skirmish with those two Re∣giments,


and the rest fell back into the Wood, and issued out upon the Reare, brought up by the Earle of 
Southamp∣ton,
 with great fury both with horse and foot: But Sir 
Henry Foliot
 made very good stand, and Sir 
Oliver Lambert
 taking his colours in his own hand, with some thirty of the Earle of 
Southamptons
 best men, hastened towards the assaylants to second the Earle, who behaved himselfe with great cou∣rage, and made the Rebels give ground.


Tyrone
 was seene not farre off with great forces, yet fell not on, so that they marched to the Camp: little hurt be∣ing done to the English, but much to the Rebels.


May
 the 26, the Deputy had Letters from the Lords in 
England,
 and it was only to answer the demands of some Irish Lords upon submission.


June
 the 19, the Lord Deputy sent to Master Secretary how that certain aide was come from 
Spaine
 to the Rebels; and makes a request for a fleet to lie on the Coast of 
Ireland,
 and some small Barks to hinder the 
Scots
 from relieving the Irish, Now Sir 
Samuel Bagnal
 drew out of the 
Newry
 into 
Monaghan,
 where he took some booty, and slue six Com∣manders, and many of the Rebels men with little damage to himselfe.


Many Rebels of 
Lemster
 now seek for mercy, but are not admitted, except some service done for the Queene against their companions.


Two chiefe Rebels offer to submit, but neither could be received without the others head.


His Lordship now out of 
England
 required to doe some thing against the 
Lemster
 rebels; in his way thither, tooke two hundred Cowes, seven hundred Garrais, and five hun∣dred sheep, burning and wasting the corne all the way, as he went to a most dangerous passage, where Sir 
Oliver Lam∣bert
 was appointed to meet him, both being constrained to


fight all the way with the rebels untill they met, having done much harme unto the rebels.


May
 the seventeenth, they both marched towards a For∣tresse, where the Rebels had stored much provision of all sorts, at whose entry there was a Foard compassed with Bogs, over which our horses passed quietly: but his Lord∣ding in the head of the foot was assayled with fury.


The Traitour 
Terrill
 having appointed a hundred shot to ply the Deputies person, and given them marks to know him.


But the English defeated and slue 35 rebels, among which was 
Owmy Mac Rory,
 a vile rebell, who before had taken the Earle of 
Ormond
 prisoner, a bloudy bold young man; by whose death that party never was able to appear in field.


And now the Captaine, and by their example the soul∣diers cut down the corn with their swords, that the rebels were driven to want for the future.


His Lordship returned one day with the foot alone, and sent about the Horse, and yet the rebels which lay there about durst not fight with him.


Eight heads of chief rebels were brought unto his Lord∣ship that night, and one arch-rebell alive, who was present∣ly hanged.


Sir 
Oliver Lambert
 foraging abroad, tooke a thousand Cowes, five hundred Garrais, and a multitude of sheep and killed twenty rebels; and much spoile daily was done then by the English.


At his Lordships going out of 
Leaz,
 some were received protection.


At this time his Lordship had letters of approbation from her Majesty, with a promise of supply both of horse and foot, and with advice to make the company lesse, there∣by


to gratifie more Gentlemen with places of command.


August
 the twentieth, his Lordship returned to 
Dublin▪
 where hee heard of the complaints that were made against him by those of the Pale to the Lords in 
England.


In answer whereunto he writes to Master Secretary, onely desiring his good wil in candid interpretation of his actions


September
 the fourteenth, his Lordship takes his journey towards the North, and encampeth three miles beyond 
Dundalke,
 and lay there untill the eighth of 
October,
 it being most tempestuous foule weather, his Lordships Tent ha∣ving been often blown over.


Tyrone,
 in the mean time, before his Lordship came, had possessed the 
Newry,
 a strong Fortresse as any the Rebels had, but his Lordship was resolved to cut his way through them if they made resistance.


Many skirmishes fell out well on our part, and in small time he came to 
Armagh,
 where not farre off his Lordship built a Fort in a very convenient place; having a River by it all environed with Bogs, & a hill like a Promontory which his Lordship called Mount 
Norris.


So hee sent some companies of ours to fetch corne and timber over the Bogs, where 
Tyrone
 met with them; and skirmishing with them was put to the worst, and next day 
Neale O Quin,
 was taken prisoner, 
Tyrones
 great Favourite.


And the rebels intending to hinder the building of the Fort were soundly beaten, and that finished and left in it foure hundred men under Captain 
Blany.


His Lordship returning by 
Carlingford
 found the passage very difficult for his horse, that they were sent a little a∣bout; and now they had certaine intelligence that 
Tyrone
 was come downe unto a place, by which we were to passe.


Which was a very great Wood at the foot of a Moun∣tain, reaching so neer the Sea, that it had no more space, then


that six or seven might walke abreast, with some lesse, and at full Sea none in some places.


His Lordship disposing his forces for the fight, sending out a forlorne hope to march afore, and a forlorne Reare.


The enemy sought to make good a small piece of ground like a semicircle, where the Sea made a Diameter, and a thick Wood the Circumference; and at the corner next to our Army, there ran a River out off the Wood at the side of which they made strong trenches, and at the further cor∣ner a Barricado which reached far into the wood, and down to the Sea.


The enemy appeared horse and foot on this plain, but at our mens going over the River, their horse drew into the Woods, and their foot into the Trenches, whence they poured out Vollies of shot.


But the stout courage of the English was such that in little space they beat them out of their Trenches and from their works, and made them retire into the woods, but sallied out againe upon our Reare; to their further losse.


And in all this not much hurt to us, only two Gentlemen of quality killed; not twenty lost, about sixty hurt, of the enemy eighty killed, and the losse was (as wee had intelli∣gence two hundred.


Our Marshall and Serjeant Major were always ready to assist the weak, and bring succour to the distressed, and the Army went on cheerfully.


And by this 
Tyrones
 reputation got a crack.


His Lordship returned to 
Dundalke,
 and from thence to 
Dublin,
 with his followers and Voluntiers, having disposed the horse and foot into Garrisons, Forts▪ and Provinces under their Commanders.


The horse were 1198. The foot 14150.


About 
November
 his Lordship sends into 
England,
 in the


behalfe of two chiefe Rebels submitted 
Conner Roe M
 Guire
 and his sonne, both which had done good service in the last North journey: and had taken 
Tyrones
 brothers el∣dest sonne, a yongman of the greatest hope in the North, and though three thousand l. were offered for his ransom, yet they brought him to the Lord Deputy. There were cer∣tain rebels neere 
Dublin,
 in the 
Glinne
 which in his Lord∣ships absence had done much spoile, so that his intent was to chastize them, but seeming and shewing to goe another way, that they should not suspect him, on Christmas day early in the morning, and after a tedious march he arrived at the chiefe rebels house, so suddenly that he took his wife and eldest sonne, and made him fly starke naked into the Woods, while his Lordship kept a good Christmas, in his house till the twentieth of 
January,
 his souldiers wasting and spoyling the Country, in the mean time. And leaving Garrisons in some places, he passed into 
Trim
 in 
Eastmeth,
 and so to 
Danoar,
 in 
Westmeth
 a strong Castle, having visi∣ted many chiefe Gentlemen in the way.


February
 the two and twentieth, his Lordship had letters out of 
England,
 in which hee heard that the Earle of 
Essex
 was in the Towre for treason; which news wrought much alteration in the Deputy; now hee begins to insinuate and comply with Secretary 
Cecill.


And 
Essex
 irreparably fell, more perchance by the sharp∣nesse of his enemies wit, then by the burthen of his owne crime.


Howsoever the Deputy being privy to so much as hee was, he said he would not put his necke under the Queenes Attourneys tongue; and resolved with himselfe that had he been sent for into 
England,
 not to have undergone the ha∣zard of a triall: but his Lordships former service, and future employment blew over this storm without any shatter fal∣ling on him.


But with countenance and good successe hee goeth for∣ward, and with courage to set on 
Tyrrils
 Island very strong, standing in the midst of a Bog, in the midst of a Plain neere an Abbey, where his Lordship proclaimed 
Tirrils
 head at two thousand Crowns, and so assayled the Island. But the next day, the foure and twentieth of 
February,
 so much snow fell that nothing could be done, and in the night the Rebels stole away quitting the Island, and left some store of corne, and a few cattell, so his Lordship passed beyond the Island into a Plain, destroying the corn and burning the houses as he went into 
Meth,
 and then to 
Trim,
 and so mar∣ched into the 
Ferney,
 from whence to 
Ardes,
 so seven miles to 
Mellifont,
 then to 
Drogedagh
 two miles, where he stayed untill the tenth of 
Aprill,
 and then went to 
Dublin,
 in all which passage nothing of moment was done, but visiting some chiefe Subjects, and striking terrour to the Rebels.


About this time his Lordship had order for the proclay∣ming of a base coine, and cry down the currant.


To hinder the Rebels traffick, as was pretended, but it proved the undoing of the poore souldier, each shilling having but two pence half-peny silver in it: so that commo∣dities were raised to an excessive rate; and the exchange which was formerly provided for their helpe, was growne difficult, or altogether put down.


At 
Drogedah,
 his Lordship altered the list of the foot, but not the horse: and disposed them into Garrisons.


Her Majesties charge in the yeere 1600 to 1601, by esta∣blishment, and orders for increase was 276914l. 9s. 4d.


Out of which by his Lordships providence was saved, 15262l. 6s. 5d.


Also by Checks imposed on the Army 1729l.


So the charges that yeere, besides munition and other ex∣traordinaries 234622.


Certaine businesses that hapned in 
Munster,
 that yeere, under the command of the Lord President, Sir 
George Ca∣rew.


In generall some submitted, and some revolted.


His Lordship comming to 
Dungarun,
 had notice that 
Florence Mac Ca
ie:
 though hee had received favours from the State, was entred into action (for so they call Rebellion) and raised in 
Carby
 and 
Desmond,
 of the Provincialls and 
Bonnaghs
 (for so are hired souldiers called) two thousand foot, never assailed the English untill they came betweene 
Kinsale
 and 
Cork,
 where they set on Captain 
Flowre
 Serjeant Major of 
Munster,
 who had 1200 foot, and 100 horse; who did valiantly resist and beat back the Rebels, though he had two horse killed under him; yet were 100 of the Rebels slain, upon which 
Florence Mac Carty
 submits, and yielded his son for pledge.


Now plots are laid for the killing of the titular Earle of 
Desmond,
 by one 
Dermod Oconner,
 who had married the Daughter of the old Earle of 
Desmond,
 and had the leading of 14000 
Bonnaghs,
 who after surprised him by a tricke, and presently sent his wife to the Lord President for the mony promised in reward, and wished him to come to 
Kilm
h,
 and there hee would bring him, but the Rebels in the way rescued him, and set him free again.


May
 the twentieth, his Lordship took the field, and mar∣ched towards 
Li
eck,
 and from place to place prosecuted the rebels so close that many submitted and others fled out of the Country: and the titular Earle of 
Desmond
 by Sir 
Charles Wil
,
 was quite driven out of the Countrey, in whose passage Sir 
George Thornton
 sent out the Garrison, and killed 120 of the Rebels, and got 320 Garrans laden with baggage, fifteen Pikes and Peeces, 40 horse; but lost sixteen horse of his owne in the fight, the titular Earle was quite


broken and stole backe into 
Munster,
 and lived as a Wood Kerne, with three or foure in his company, and once againe being like to be surprized, he ran away in such hast, that he left his shooes behind him.


The Lord Deputy wasted and gathered in all the corne, so that the yeere following the Rebels were pinched, and in 
Munster
 all subdued or submitted, so that 400 of that Province received their pardons under the great Seal.


And all being quiet, hee did question the Corporate Towns that were so ready to assist the Rebels, as being ai∣ders and abetters of the rebellion for their owne private gaine.


And so he sent 1000 of the 
Munster
 List to the Lord De∣puty to be disposed at his pleasure.


The Lord Deputy and the Counsell wrote into 
England
 from 
Tredagh,
 where he had layne from 
March,
 21, untill 
Aprill
 the sixteenth following, to signifie that many chiefe rebels had submitted.


Chiefe of the 
Ferny
 and of the 
Fewes,
 and the chiefe like∣wife of the 
Bienny.


And further sollicited for supplyes of mony, victuals and munition, to be sent some to 
Dublin,
 but most to 
Galloway,
 for the forces to plant 
Ballishannon.


An establishment signed by the Queen, 
March
 31, 1601, which was according to the former, the charge 255773l. besides the charge of munition, of levying horse and foot, for re-inforcing the Army, with many like charges.


About 
April
 divers Rebels in the North submit, and dis∣cover many secrets to our Captaine concerning the 
Spanish
 Invasion this yeare.


Oghy Ohanlon
 submitted at 
Tredagh,
 and subscribed to di∣vers Articles.


The Garrison at 
Liffer
 did spoyle the rebels, and tooke 300 Cows.


The Lord Deputy kept Saint 
Georges
 Feast at 
Dublin, April
 the twentieth, inviting many of the submitted Rebels, where he carryed himselfe with such wisdome and gravity; that they did both admire him and feare him.


In 
May, Munster
 Rebels had their pardons granted them upon the intercession of the Lord President.


A list out of five English Shires, and Irish Submitties, 207 horse, 374 Archers, as likewise arising out of the Irish Lords and their Captains horse 128, Kerne 361.


And now preparation is made for the Summer service, whence to take forces for the field.!


To be drawne out of 
Munster
 to 
Connagh,
 a thousand foot, fifty horse.


And in 
Connagh
 already 1150 foot, horse 74.


Thus to be disposed in 
Connagh,
 at 
Galloway,
 and 
Athlone;
 350 foot.


At the Abbey of 
Boyle
 in 
Connagh,
 under the command of the Earle of 
Clanrichard,
 a thousand foot, 62 horse.


To leave in 
Lemster
 side of the 
Shannon,
 at the 
Annaly,
 to further the plantation of 
Balishannan,
 eight hundred foot, horse twelve.


These all lying to infest the Rebels, or to hinder their joyn∣ing together, or to hinder Northerne forces from comming into 
Lemster.


And to hinder 
Tyrones
 gathering in the corn.


May
 the two and twentieth, his Lordship parts from 
Du∣blin,
 and wrote into 
England
 for six thousand souldiers ready, if so be any forreigne aide should come, and to have a Ma∣gazine at 
Limrick,
 many pardoned in the County of 
Corke.


And about the eight of 
June,
 his Lordship came neere the Pace of 
Moyry,
 where hee purposed to build a Fort to secure that Pace.


Now againe, hee sollicits his former demands by Letters into 
England.


And so he marched by 
Dundalke
 to 
Lecagh,
 comming sud∣denly on them he took much booty, and many submitted to his Lordship in this passage, from thence he went to Mount 
Norris,
 and so hee intended to plant a Garrison at 
Armagh,
 and so forth hee went to 
Blackwater,
 to see that way to that Fort, where the Marshall 
Bagnal
 had his defeat.


The foure and twentieth, hee marched two miles short of the 
Newry,
 with a thousand two hundred and fifty foot, and an hundred and fifty horse.


The nine and twentieth day, his Lordship had notice that Sir 
Henry Davers
 had done much damage to 
Brisan mac Art,
 in killing his men, and taking his cattell.


Many received Pardons and were accepted of, because that certaine newes came, that the Spanish forces which lay at 
Lisbone,
 were to come for 
Ireland.


So his Lordship disposed of the Companies into Garri∣sons and Forts neere the enemies Countrey, and went with his followers to 
Dundalke,
 having with him onely three com∣panies of foot, and a troop of horse; but going towards the North, he gathered some forces out of the Garrisons, so he went to a Hill neere Blackwater on the Southside, making a stand where 
Tyrone
 and his horse and foot shewed themselves in a Medow beyond the River with Trumpets, and Drums, and Colours which they used not to doe before, but now only in a bravado.


Making some shot at us, which being at too fat distance fell short without doing, any hurt, but we having a Rabenet and a Falcon planted on a little Hill, made some shot at the Rebels which made them seulke into the Woods like Pup∣pits.


So that his Lordship sent 300 foot to a Hill close by the waterside; and at the evening came and encamped upon it, whence he saw 
Tyrone
 draw some horse over the water to our side; but Sir 
William G
d
lphin
 went with a troope of horse to meet him, but he presently retyred back.


So we placing the two small pieces, charging them with Musket shot, drove the Rebels out of the Trenches, which they had made beyond the River, so that the 300 men pas∣sed over the River and possessed them, and an adjoyning old Fort, with a plain, not altogether Musket shot from the Wood, where the Rebell was fled, and his Lordship seeing the Trenches did admire that they wold take so much pains to make that which they had so little care to keepe, so his Lordship went to view a Place in 
Tyrones
 Wood, who stood looking on us; who only made a few shot at our men in their retreat.


So the sixteenth his Lordship passing over the 
Blackwater,
 with a Regiment of 
Irish,
 marched to a place at the left hand of our Campe, at the entrance of a great Wood, where our men made a stand in a fair green Medow, having our Campe not farre behinde them, and the Wood at each side and before them; in which great multitudes of the Re∣bels were assembled; so that there hapned a great and large skirmish; with various accidents; sometimes they; some∣times wee giving ground; for the Lord Deputy drew our forces out of the Campe, as he saw the Rebels increase.


Doctor 
Latwar
 his Lordships Chaplaine, not content to see this in the Campe, went into the Medow to our Co∣lours, and was shot so that he died the next day.


Not one more slain of the English only a Captaines legg broken, but 26 of the Irish on our side, and 72 hurt, such as were kept in pay only, that they should not side with the Rebell.


Among the Rebels 
Tyrones
 Secretary, and above two hundred Kernes were killed, which did much abate their courage, and animate our men.


His Lordship wrote into 
England,
 complayning of the scarcity of the victuals, and that which was, being salt fish, which as hee said was most unfit for marching, was not good nor wholsome.


His Lordship rising from about Blackwater, made ano∣ther Proclamation for 
Tyrones
 head at 1000l. and 2000l. to bring him alive.


So hee marched too and fro spoyling and cutting downe all the Corn thereabouts, and burning houses in the woods neere where the Rebels lay, but would not fight.


So he returned to the Blackwater, and with some choice foot and horse went to view the way to 
Dungannon, Tyron's
 chief house, ten miles distant, and setting some to cut down the wood the Rebels sought to hinder them, but were bea∣ten back, so after we marched six miles to 
Armagh,
 and three to 
Rawlaghtany.


From whence Sir 
Hen. Davers
 with 300 foot and 40 horse, went to burn some houses that stood in a Fortresse which he performed, but the Rebels followed them back even to our Campe into which they poured a Volley of shot, and retyred into an adjoyning Fortresse.


Here the Commissary viewed the Army, and found in the List 2950, but by Pole 1728.


The fourth day at night the Rebels came with cryes, Drums and Bag-pipes, as if they would have attempted our Campe.


And poured into it two or three thousand shot, but do∣ing little hurt.


For his Lordship commanded that none of our men should stirre, having lodged in a Trench some 400 shot,


with command that they should not give fire untill the re∣bels were neere; which doing they put up paid with the shot, and sent out lamentable cryes. So then his Lordship sent for more forces because hee had intelligence, that 
Ty∣ron's
 Army was much increased.


Now there came more certaine newes of the 
Spaniards
 comming, and of their intention to land at 
Waterford,
 in re∣spect of the commodious harbour, and the peoples good affection unto the 
Spaniards.


A speedy supply of a thousand shot was required out of 
England,
 because 
Tyrone
 was growne very strong, as appea∣red by a list given by one that had been lately 
Tyrones
 Mar∣shall, and now received into favour: as followeth.




Tyrone
 for his guard 100 horse.


His sonne 
Hugh O Neale,
 100 horse, in all 400.


His brother 
Carmack,
 100 horse in all 400.


Art mac Baron,
 20 horse,


Phelim O hanlors
 sonne, 10 horse.


Turlogh Brasils
 sonne 50 horse.


Con Tyron's
 base sonne, 20 horse.


His guard of foot, led by 
James O sheale
 a 
Lemster
 man, 200. 400


Led by 
Jenken Fitz Simon
 of 
Lecale,
 200. 400


Other chiefe Commanders of foot, 3260 foot.


Tot.
 Horse and Foot, 4060.




All these (except 300) had meanes to keepe themselves and companies in 
Tyrone:
 and divers of them besides have great forces to keep their owne forces.


About this time some discourtesies hapned between the Lord Deputy and the Lord President of 
Munster,
 for that he had made some complaints of the Deputy in 
England,
 but by perswasion of Secretary 
Cecil,
 the Lord Presidents great friend, they were united as fast as greatnes will permit.


His Lordship for want of victuall lay about 
Armagh,
 and the Blackwater Fort.


Aug.
 29. his Lordship came to 
Trim,
 where the counsell of 
Dublin
 met him, and from whence, 
September
 the third, they wrote into 
England,
 in excuse that they had passed the limited summe of 6000 for extraordinaries: it being farre too little to compasse so much businesse, and provide so many things as was needfull; and had not been able out of it to repaire 
Athlone
 Castle, the Key of 
Connagh;
 nor divers other Forts and Castles of great consequence.


Now intelligence came from Secretary 
Cecill,
 that the 
Spaniards
 were discovered about 
Sylly
 45 sayle, (whereof 17 men of warre) and supposed that they would l
nd 
t 
Lim∣rick:
 most of them 100 tun apiece, and had six thousand souldiers in them.


As also other letters from the Councell in 
England,
 that his Lordship would aske what supplyes were needfull, and that in convenient time.


September
 the nineteenth, two thousand men out of 
Eng∣land
 arrived, some in 
Corke,
 and some in 
Waterford.


And his Lordship writes for store of munition and vi∣ctuals, to be with all speed sent to 
Dublin,
 telling Ma∣ster Secretary that 
Tyrones
 very friends would faile with his fortune, and many others when they could rid themselves of the feare of him.


And that the Irish submitted Lords desired to continue subjects, if they might see appearance of defence, though perchance not so much out of their honest disposition, as for the smart they yet feele of a bitter persecution.


In 
June,
 the Queene wrote to the Lord Deputy with her own hand, a most gracious acceptance, and a free commen∣dations of his good service.


September
 the three and twentieth, the 
Spanish
 Fleet came into 
Kinsale,
 lying between 
Rosse
 and 
Corke
 Bay out into the South Sea: the Lord Deputy and Lord President of 
Mun∣ster,



being both together with the Councell at 
Kilkenny,
 whence they road both to 
Corke.


Where they understood the number of the 
Spaniards
 to be about six thousand, under the command of 
Don Jean de Aquila,
 who was one of the chiefest Commanders of the King of 
Spaine,
 and had been Generall in 
Britany:
 And that a thousand of them scattered by foul weather, were landed at 
Baltamore
 to the Westward of 
Kinsale.


And that they expected (according to promise) great aid and assistance from the pretended Earle of 
Desmond
 and 
Florence, Mac Carty,
 who were both taken prisoners, and al∣ready sent into 
England.


And that they had brought sixteene hundred great Sad∣dles, for which 
Tyrone
 had promised to furnish them with horse, and then they would keepe the field, for they had likewise many armes in hope the Irish Rebels would sup∣ply them with men, which would revolt at their first ap∣pearance.


About 
October,
 many letters are sent into 
England,
 to the Counsell and to Master Secretary.


And he tels them, that seeing the occasions are so great, good supplies are to be sent with all speed, because defence must be made for the subject that hath means.


And money also, because the Swordmen which have no means, will goe to the enemy if wee entertain them not.


Thus his Lordship streightned for want of men, to sup∣presse the rebels in the North, and oppose the forreigne enemy in the South; but that God who accounts rebellion as the sin of Witchcraft, and an evill thought against law∣full Soveraignty impiety, did so counsell and incourage him, that collecting a small force together to 
Corke,
 hee shews himselfe in field, and presently marched within five miles of 
Kinsale,
 and on the 17 of 
October,
 within halfe a mile


of the walls, and sate down under a hill called 
Kn
c Robin,
 whither the 
Spaniard
 out of the Towne, made some shot to hinder his encamping but could not.


And the next night made a great salley, but were beaten back again.


Many skirmishes hapned between the 
English & Spaniard,
 who always went backe by weeping crosse; by Gods pro∣vidence and the valour of our stout Commanders. So that 
Don Jean
 himselfe said hee never saw men come more wil∣lingly to the sword then ours.


There was little done by reason our artillery were not come to the Campe.


But the 26, our Campe rose and intrenched themselves very strongly on Spittle Hill, on the North side of 
Kinsale,
 a little above Musket shot of the Town.


Sir 
John Barkley
 with three other Captains, the night be∣fore falling into the 
Spaniards
 Trenches, made them forsake them; and fell into the gate of the Towne with them, and killed and hurt above 20 of them, having but three of our men hurt.


The disposall of the whole army in Forts & Garrisons.


Left at 
Loughfoyle
 horse 100, foot 3000 under severall Captains.




Left at 
Caricfergus
 horse 150, foot 850.


In 
Lecale,

Left in the North Garrisons, horse 100.


Foot in No: Garrisons 800.


Left in the Pale and places adjoyning 175.


Foot in the Pale under severall Captains 3150.


Left in 
Connagh
 62 horse.


Foot left there, 1150.


Tot.
 587 horse.


foot 9100.








A list of the Army with his Lordship at 
Kinsale.


The old 
Munster
 list, Horse 175. Foote 1950.


New Companies 2000 Foot.


Brought from the North and the Pale to 
Kinsale,
 436 horse, more foote 950. more foot 2080. tot. at 
Kinsale
 horse 611. Foot 6900.




The whole Army in 
Ireland
 1198 horse, 1600 foot.


But many of these Companies were very deficient: the the 27. our Artilery were landed at Oyster haven, and brought into the Campe: and two Culverings were planted to batter the Castle of 
Rincovaur
 which the Spaniards pos∣sessed from their first comming, which Castle commanded the harbour of 
Kinsale,
 but one of the Peeces presently brake, so we planted two more, which grew so hot, that the enemy, seeing they could not bee releeved, neither by water nor land (for both had beene tryed, but in vaine) sent out a parly for Conditions that would not bee accep∣ted, but presently after for life only, which was granted, being 86 in number, and some 30 had beene slaine in the defence of it.


The Spaniards drew a demi Cannon out of the Towne, and did play into our Campe: the first shot killed two men, and indangered many, piercing his Lordships tent, the shot altogether falling about his quarter, some supplies of men, munition, and 
ctuals, came out of 
England
 at this time, brought by the Earle of 
Thomond,
 and being noysed that 
Ty∣rone
 was comming downe with a great Army to joyne with the Spanyard; the campe was strongely fortified on the north side from the Towne; and the next day the Lord President with 2100. Foot, and 325 horse drew out into the borders of the Province to stop him, at least hinder his passage.


But the Spaniards getting intelligence of the Lord Presi∣dents


going out of the Campe, and supposing us thereby to be much weakned, about noone they drew out most of their forces, and sent 60. shot and pikes to the foot of the hill neere our Campe, leaving their 
enches very well lined.


Some entertained skirmish with those that did approach so neere; Others of our men went about and set upon the trenches, and beat the Spaniards out of them, so that when the formost retyred, supposing to have reliefe of their seconds which they left in the Trenches they were deceived, and faine to make haste into the Towne: many of them hurt and killed, a Serjant taken, so that 
Don Jean
 committed the Serjant ma∣jor: commended the valour of our men, and that his owne had lost their reputation.


And commanded that no man should after come off from his service, except he were fetched off by an Officer.


The 13. day ten great ships came into 
Kinsale
 under the command of Sir 
Ri
h. Leveson,
 who brought 2000. Foot with Munition and Artillery: and Officers of all kinds to attend the same.


A list of the Army at 
Kinsale
 Foot 11800.


Out of which was chosen a flying Regiment (as they cal∣led it) to answer all alarmes, and were exempted from other duties.


The Horse 857.


The Castle 
Niparke
 upon a breach made by our cannon, yeelded only on condition of saving their lives, sixteen being only left in it; It stood in an Island beyond the water.


The Lord President returned with foure Regiments, two he carryed out, and two met him, and comming to the Campe, they quartered by themselves on the West side of 
Kinsale,
 and were commanded by the Earle of 
Thomand,
 for the Lord Pre∣sident went to the Lord Deputy.


The Towne with a Demi-Cannon played upon our Admi∣rall,


and Vice-Admirall in the the harbour of 
Kinsale.


And shot them throughout.


But our Shippe peeces presently dismounted the Demi∣cannon, and hurt their chiefe Gunner.


Our battery lay so continually upon the Towne on all sides, that did it much offend the enemy within, who impa∣tient that we built a fort close to the towne West gate.


Made a brave sally with 2000 men on our Ordinance on the East side, and made most furious assault, having brought with them tooles to cloy the Peeces, and to dismount them if possible.


And indevoured to pull downe the Gabions in our tren∣ches and baskets filled with earth, for the safegard of our Gunners and Cannoneeres.


But they found such resistance by the great courage of our men, that they were driven to retreate into the Towne, leaving above 120 dead in the place, and many slaine neere the towne, some others taken prisoners.


But on our side not many hurt, two Captaines and one Lievtenant killed.


Among the Spaniards at their shipping many of them were found to have Spells, Characters, and hallowed Me∣dalls, as preservatives against death.


A Drumme was sent to offer 
Don Jean
 to bury his slaine, who returned thankes, but withall prayed the Lord Deputie to see them buried, promising to doe the like for ours, when they fell in his power.


At this time newes came that sixe Spanish ships were put into 
Castle-haven,
 neere 
Baltamore,
 and sixe more were scat∣tered from them by foule weather, these six brought two thousand men, and many Ordnance and Munition, and news that 20000 more were comming.


Sir 
Richard Levison
 getting five or sixe ships out of the


harbour of 
Kinsale,
 got in little time into 
Castle-haven,
 and and sunke one Spanish ship.


The Admirall of the Spaniard having 9 Foot water in her hould drave on a rocke, and the Vice-Admirall and two others run aground, most of the Spaniards quitting them.


And so our Fleet returned to 
Kinsale.


Into which harbour came a Scottish Barke laden with 80 Spaniards, who were by the Master put all into the hands of the English, so were landed and carryed into the Campe, upon whose examination divers discoveries were made, that great preparations were made for 
Ireland,
 and that in 
Spain
 they doubted not but that it was taken already.


Now intelligence came to the Campe that 
O Donnell
 was joyned with the Spaniards that landed at 
Castle-haven,
 & that he together with all the forces that 
Tyrone
 could make, would releeve 
Kinsale.


Upon which our Campes did more strongly fortifie and intrench themselves for their owne defence.


And so had not leasure to follow the batteryes as they had done before, because the new supplies were much wa∣sted with hard service, and great sicknesse.


Two small Sconces were built at the West side of the Towne, betweene the Earle of 
Thomands
 quarter and the water, and so cast up trenches from place to place, to invest the town to the land, and hinder the driving in of the cattell into the town. 
O Donnels
 forces, are said to be 4000. and 
Ty∣rones
 8000. which are all to joyne with the Spaniards, and lye not above sixe miles from our Campe.


A Letter was intercepted, sent to 
Oneale
 by the Spanish Generall.



To the Prince Oneale, and Lord O Donnell.


J Thought your Excellencies would have come at 
Don Ri∣cardos
 going, since he had order from you, to say that up∣on


the Spaniards comming to you (from 
Castle-haven
) you would doe me that favour; And so I beseech you now, you will do it, and come as speedily and as well appointed as may be: for I assure you that the enemy, are tyred and very few, and they cannot guard the third part of their trenches, which shall not availe them, for resisting their first fury, all is ended.


The manner of your comming, your Excellencies know better there then I to give here: for I will give them enough to doe this way, being alwayes watching to give the blow all that I can, and with some resolution that your Excellency fighting as ye doe alwayes, I hope in God the victory shall be ours without doubt, because the cause is his.


And I more desire the victory for the interest of your Ex∣cellencie, then mine owne.


And so there is nothing to be done, but to bring your squa∣drons; come well appointed and close withall, that being mingled with the enemies; their forts will doe as much harme to themselves as unto us.


The Lord keepe your Excell. 
Kinsale
 Decemb. 18. after the old stile.


Though you be not well fitted, I beseech your Excellen. to dislodge and come towards the enemy, for expedition im∣ports, it is needfull that we all be on horseback at once, and the greater hast the better,


Signed by Don Iean de Aquila.




This newes made us ply our batteryes the more, and the like importunitie made 
Tyrone
 advance within a mile of us in the way to 
Corke.


But some of our Foot drawing out of the Campe towards him; for that time he drew himselfe into the woo
s.


Our Army was but weake at this time, many sick, and some run away in number 6595.


Tyrone
 often shewed his Horse and Foot on a hill not 
a
e off; and we had intelligence from one of 
Tyrones
 Comman∣ders that both he and the Spaniards resolved to a
t our Campe together on all sides in the night.


But 
Tyrones
 guides missing the way, happened to be with
 an houre of day, when they were discried, in a plain not far from our Campe: where 
Tirrill
 led the vantgard wherin the Spaniards from Castle haven were, 
Tyrone
 leading their battell, and 
O Donnell
 their reare intending to force the great Campe.


But the Lord Deputy, with the Lord President having sate in Counsell all that night drew out some regiments. The Marshall Sir 
Richard Wingfield
 with 400 horse, and Sir 
Henry Fowers
 regiment advanced within 20 score of the e∣nemy, resolving to give them battell, two more regiments being come up; which the enemy perceiving retyred over a foard somewhat disorderly, and the Marshall seeing it de∣sired leave of the Lord Deputy to fight; which being gran∣ted to take occasion according to his discretion, hee pre∣sently marched forward over the foard.


The enemy still retyring further over the bogge into a plaine, hoping to find the bogge some safegard from us.


But the Marshall with some horse and foot went to the bogge side, and gave them occasion of skirmish; there their Battalians standing firme on the one side of the bogge, and our foot on the other.


In the meane time the Marshall found a way through the Foord to the ground where the Rebels stood, hee possessed the same with some foot, and presently got over three troope of Horse, with which he charged the enemies bat∣tailes of 1800 men, but finding them stand firme, wheeled about.


But now three troope of Horse more, and two Regiments


of foot which were with the Lord Deputy, who stood not farre off with a vigilant eye, came all up.


So that the Marshall with the Horse charged home upon the reare of the Battell, which being Irish, and not used to fight in the plaine, especially seeing their horse dye, which were the chief Gentlemen (in number five or six hundred) were suddenly routed, and our men followed the execution. The other two Battels seeing the other routed, advanced to their succour, but the Lord Deputy sending another Re∣giment to charge on the flanke of the Vangard, which pre∣sently retyred disorderly, being followed by our horse and foot. But the Spaniards that were not so light footed, drew out by themselves, yet were soon broken (by a troope of horse led by Sir 
William God
lphin
) and most of them kil∣led their Commander 
Don Alinza del Campo
 taken priso∣ner, together, with two Captaines, 7 
Alfieroes,
 Ensignes or Colours (as we call them) and 40 souldiers.


In the mean time many of the light-footed Irish escaped away, by advantage of this execution done on the 
Spaniard.
 and all the mayn battaile except 60 were killed.


On our side little hurt, Sir 
Richard Greames
 Coronet kil∣led, some Commanders of quality hurt, and six souldiers hurt, many of our horses killed, and others hurt. Of the Irish 1200 left dead in the place, besides those that were killed in two miles chase. Wee took nine of their Ensignes, all their Drums, Powder, and two thousand armes.


And their destruction had been greater, had not the gree∣dinesse of our men in pillaging and rifling the 
Spaniards
 hin∣dred it.


And had not our foot been tired out with continuall ser∣vice, and our horse spent for want of provision to keepe them in good case, we had cut the throat of all the Rebels, for they never made resistance▪ nor looked behind them, but ran and shifted for their lives.


His Lordship presently in the midst of the dead bodies, gave thanks to God for this great victorie.


So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord, but let them that love him be as the Sun when he goeth forth in his might.


The Rebels were upon report about six thousand foot, & 500 horse, whereof 14 Captains slain, souldiers slain 1995.


His Lordship had not above 1200 foot, and lesse then 400 horse, so that it was Gods great goodnesse to give him the day.


And about noon he returned giving volleys of shot in manner of Triumph.


Which the 
Spaniards
 in the town hearing, who had layn still all this while expecting 
Tyrone,
 and now supposed that it had been he, made a sally out upon our Campe, but soone perceiving their errour, they did retire into the town again.


But made divers sallies out to hinder our making of tren∣ches, and other works which now we did most earnestly.


About the last of 
December, Don Jean
 sent to the Deputy about a parley, tearming him Vice-roy, and much complai∣ned of the treachery and falshood of the Irish.


And that if honorable conditions were offered, he would accept; and so after many parlyes and propositions, Arti∣cles were accorded on both sides.


That the 
Spaniard
 with all he had, and while they tarry be well intreated, and have things necessary for their mo∣ney: and sent safe away into 
Spain
 in 
English
 ships, assoone as conveniently they may: paying for their passage, and leaving a pledge for the safe returne of them backe againe.


So our army went to refresh it self at 
Corke,
 and the 
Span.
 abroad in 
Kinsale;
 only 
Don Jean▪
 rode with the Deputy, and made means to his Lordship, that his Excellencie would shew some commiseration on the Spanish prisoners that were in 
Corke,
 that were in great extremity for want of pro∣vision in number 160.


Ian
 25▪ certaine Captaines are dispatched West ward to receive from the 
Spaniards,
 at 
Castle-haven, Baltamore,
 and 
B
r-haven,
 those Castles which they possessed, but they not knowing of this their Generals Composition, they a
 
B
r-haven
 being 60, did build a Fort of trees and earth and planted three pieces in it.


About the eight of 
March
 (for so long it was by reason of foule weather and crosse winds, before all the 
Spaniards▪
 could be sent home; his Lordship with the Army attending▪ thereabout, not willing to trust them over-much, or give them occasion of doing ill.


About the end of the yeere 1601, his Lordship wrote unto the Counsell in 
England,
 shewing them the hope that they had of the peace and quiet of 
Munster,
 upon the death and execution of three arch-rebels.


Likewise shewing them there was great discontentment in the army, upon an occasion of an abatement of halfe a pound of beefe to each m
 a day, and two herring o
sh∣days; and that the horsmen did murmure, for that 
; were raised 5 s. in a quarter more then usual, being but 
 before▪ now 15 s. which his Lordship did alter againe for feare of a mutiny.


And presently after his Lordship fell sicke, and so con∣tinued repayring to 
Dublin
 to take physi
k.


Now here Majesties charge is cast up for the former yeer ending 1602, and it was 246087 l▪ 7 s. 8. d.


Besides the 
Concord
u
▪
 Bils impressed upon account here, the levies and transporting of forces, (paid in 
Eng∣land▪
 the payment of works, and the charge of the office of the Ordnance, Powder, Bullets, &c.


Now a List is taken of the army in the beginning of the
 yeere▪ 1602▪ Collonels 14.


Totall
 of the horse by the list 1487. foot 16950.


But of these only 500 horse▪ and 3650 foot went into the field with his Lordship, the rest were placed in severall Forts, Castles, and Countries▪ for the better preventing of the Rebels joyning together, and were so placed, that upon little warning many o
 them might meet with his Lord∣ship, now intending to bend all his forces on 
Tyrons
 country.


So being recovered, took the field in 
Iune,
 and marching up to 
Blackwater,
 to the fittest passage into the heart, of 
Ty∣rone
 five miles Eastward from the Fort of 
Blackwater.


There was but a small space or skirt of a Wood between our Camp and the River, which wood he had cut through the yeere before, and there building a bridge over the Ri∣ver, and a Fort to safegard it (calling it 
Charlemount,
 he pas∣sed to 
Dungannon,
 six miles distant, a plaine open way: whence 
Tyrone
 making hast away left the Towne and his own house there seated all a fire, so his Lordship sending a
 company before to view it, presently marched thither with his army, and 
Tyrone
 fled as high as the Castle 
R
,
 upon
 be▪ 
Ban,
 his Lordship sent out. Companys to spoyle and for∣rage, as farre as 
En
killin
 or 
Lough Erne,
 and taking two of 
Tyrones
 chiefe Islands, hee marched to 
Lough-Sidney
 where he met Sir 
Arthur Chicester▪
 with his forces; who came from 
Carickfergus;
 at their meeting place his Lordship raised a For
 capable of a 1000 foot, and 100 horse, and called in 
Mountjoy,
 after his own Barony. And his Lordships resolu∣tions were to follow 
Tyrone
 from place to place, but that a scarcity of victuals hindred him, so that he was fa
▪ for 20 days to go
 elswhere to provide, but leaving those Garri∣sons in the mean time, so strong about 
Tyrone,
 that he should not dare to venture on the plain
, and they stirring about to seek after him in his fortress, he should not feed his 
C
is
 abroad.


Now fresh news came of new supplyes from 
Spaina,
 and


confirmed, for that a ship of 
Spaine
 arrived at 
Ardea,
 and brought 
O Swillivan Beare,
 and other Captaines of the Re∣bels munition and store of money: which made them grow somewhat resolute, whereas before they were ready to sue for mercy: this caused some obstructions in their proceed∣ing.


But the Lord Deputy intending to take the field and have the 
Newry
 but hearing that 
Tyrone
 would send and di∣sturbe the parts about 
Killultagh,
 to hinder that himselfe should not be prosecuted,


His Lordship sent some Commanders to invest a strong Fort wherein lay all the goods of such Rebels as were fled into 
Tyrone:
 called 
Enishlanghen,
 which was seated in the midst of a great Bog, and no way accessable, but through thick Woods very hardly passable, and the Fort had about it two deep ditches both compassed with strong Pallisado's a very high and thick Rampire of earth, and timber, and well flanked with Bulwarks, and sixty souldiers for its de∣fence; who by the industry and valour of our men were made to yield, and men brought to his Lordship at the 
Newly.


This done his Lordship took the field, 
Aug.
 20, marched towards 
Armagh,
 and so spoyled 
Tyron's
 Country, who was fled into 
Fermanagh;
 from whence he went to a Fortresse at the bottome of 
Lough Earne,
 so that hee could not be ap∣proched, so that making wast thereabouts & leaving Garri∣sons, at the end of Sūmer his Lordship returned to 
Dublin.


About 
October
 20, many Rebels offered submission, espe∣cially many of 
Tyrones
 Captains, and 
Tyron
 himself writes an humble letter to the Lord Deputy.


Who begins a journey into 
Connagh
 to take the submis∣sion of other Rebels, and to view the Towne of 
Galloway,
 where he continued all Christmas, and caused a fort to be built there.


The Lord President of 
Munster,
 went to surprize the ca∣stle of 
Dunbay
 which 
Oswillivan Bear
 got from the 
Spaniard,
 at 
Bearhaven,
 where in were sixty Warders, and three peeces of Ordnance, neere unto which his Lordship pitched his camp having a rising hil between it & the castle; there were within it some 
Spaniards & Italians:
 But our battery making a breach was entred by the English, and possessed part of it, but the Rebels defended the rest all the day and night, and part of the next day: untill our men wonne it by force, and slue and executed 134 men, sparing 12 of good account, which were kept to worke upon 
Tirrill.
 Spanish Ordnance taken in this Fort, one Demyculvering, two Sacres, and one Falcon all of brasse, and two Sacres, five Minions, and one Falcon of iron; the Castle was blown up, and his Lord∣ship returned to 
Corke,
 Sir 
Samuel Bagual
 with a Regiment, fell by night into 
Tirrils
 Campe, lying in 
Muskerry,
 killed 80 of his men, made him flie away in his shirt, took a thou∣sand cattell, 60 horses and hackneys, and much rich spoyle.


And Sir 
Charles Wilmot
 brake by night into the quarters. of the Knight of 
Kerry,
 killed 40 of his men, tooke 500 Cows, 200 Garrais, and two moneths provision of meale, and meeting with other Rebels, he took in all 2000 Cows, 4000 sheep, and 1000 Garrais, so that the Rebels as b
oken men flew towards 
Pale:
 About this time Captain 
Taffe
 com∣manding our Irish in 
Carbery,
 assaulted a band of Rebels, led by a Priest the Popes 
Nuntio,
 who killed the Priest with most of his men, and got his cattell.


Upon whose death 
Mac Carties,
 & all 
Cerbery
 submitted.


So the Lord President from 
Connagh
 returned to 
Munster,
 and leaving two Commissioners to governe 
Munster
 in the beginning of 
March,
 sailed into 
England.


And now 
Tyrone
 himself sues for the Queenes favour, which she is very unwilling to grant, supposing him not worthy to live, who had cost so many lives, and caused he


so much charge and trouble: yet the Deputy earnestly me∣diates, but it doth not appeare that ever shee did yield unto it; yet willing he should come in.


But 
Tyrone
 had little left but the grudging of the com∣mon people, which alwayes followes disasters, and exclay∣med that he had ingaged the ruine of his whole Nation, for his owne private disco
tents, and that these warres how∣soever beneficiall to him, yet were they most pe
nicious to them. Thus 
Tyrone
 having almost, if not altogether worne out and wasted his friends and fortune, found it high time to seek 
avour and accept it upon any terms.


Which the Deputy having secret intelligence of (the Queens death not yet publikely knowne) made some haste to accept of his submission, lest another should have taken the beast out, that he had taken in his toyle.


And so 
March
 30, 1603, at 
Me
ifont
 hee made his humble submission to the Deputy (sitting in a Chaire of State) on his knees, and in the company of the Deputy rode to 
Dublin, April
 4.


At which time open tydings came of the death of that victorious Queen, and the happy comming in of K. 
James:
 do the Earle of 
Tyrone,
 made a new submission to the De∣puty, as to King 
James
 King of 
England.


And now upon this change divers of the Towns and Ci∣ties, as 
Cork, Waterford,
 and 
Wexford,
 through the 
educing of the Priests and Jesuits) had set up the Idolatrous Masse▪ and brought in Popish superstition, by force and violence, on a 
a
e suggestion, that K. 
James
 was a favourer of the same.


So the Deputy was 
ike to have a new businesse in hand by those that had not shewed themselves all this time; who seeing their hope of gaine gone, the rebellion growing to an end, themselves will venture to continue it rather then let it 
ke.


As 
Limrick
 and 
Galloway,
 but especially 
Corke
 grew ex∣ceeding insolent, and by force to advance to the height, the Romish Religion.


And for prevention hereof his Lordship first writes to the 
Maior,
 and then drawes towards them with the Kings forces.


Hanged some of the Ring-leaders at 
Corke,
 sware the o∣ther Cities to obedience, leaving strong Garrisons in them. Left Sir 
George Carem
 the Kings Deputy, sent for 
Tyrone,
 and carried him into 
England;
 where he was joyfully welcomed, and graciously entertained at the Court, created Earle of 
Devonshire,
 and made a privy Counsellour, 
Tyrone
 having procured his pardon of the King, and a Proclamation for his safegard in his return to 
Ireland,
 being grown exceeding odious to our Nation, there he stayed awhile, but after be∣ing disloyall, fled into 
Spain,
 and there died.


The War ended the army List, horse 1000, foot 11150, and after to be reduced to 8000 foot.


The charge from 1602 to 1603, beside 
concordatum,
 muni∣tion, and other extraordinaries 290733 l. 8 s. 9 d. Which War continued from 
October
 1, 1598: to the last of 
March,
 1603, which was foure yeeres and a halfe, and cost besides great 
concordatums,
 great charge of munition, and other great charge of Extraordinaries 1198717 l. 19 s.


Thus was 
Ireland
 by that noble Lord cured of its despe∣rate state, and brought into the most absolutest subjection, in which it had ever been since the first conquest. And had the resolution held of disarming the Papists, which after∣ward could not be effected when our army was reduced to so small a number.


Or the eye of Policy or Church Discipline been so vi∣gilant or observable, as it might have been.


We need not now have 
 what we may justly, though 
 enough lament.


But whether slides my eager pen, it was my promise to set a period to that sad Seene; and how meanly performed, no man knows better then my selfe.


But since that Tragick part is now againe (after so many haleyon happy dayes) come on the Stage; it calls to minde still some sad events which then hapned, and follow 
 Rebellion, whose indentive is imaged 
ancour, and end 
 and destruction.


For besides that inhumane disposition of the Native Irish▪ as appeared by a barbarous fact committed about 
 in 
ent
 by three Irish people in their house, killing them and burning that running away by the light; but were apprehended, executed, and hung on Gibbets. There is an imbred hatred in them towards the English, and a generall dislike of our Civill government, but much more of our Religion, the love of the Irish to 
Spain,
 (whence some of them are descended.


The least successe of the Rebels, and the hope of pardon upon the worst event; which last by the great wisdome of the 
 is prevented by 
etting their 
 
ale assoone as they are en
ed into Rebellion, the better to awe them; for those continuall parleys and overtures of peace proved most dangerous to the State, and most advan∣tageous to the Rebels▪ and caused them to revolt upon the least 
 and where as the 
i
es have layen so loo
e on them these many years▪ it makes them proue 
adish, who by nature goe best with a hard hand.


Being best preserved by the same means by which they were first gained.


These things lying 
 in their hearts (has now 
oake out in a filthy running soare) especially pressed by


the hands of Priests and Iesuits, who for their owne 
 and end
, care not what exigence and extrea
ity they 
 those mis
ed people into, who were they so wi
e as to con∣sider those miseries they formerly indured, when the pro∣vision of the Countrey was destroyed, and they lay scat∣tered in the wayes dead by 1000 with hunger, and nothing more common then to see multitudes of those miserable people dead in the ditches of Towne, with their mouthes all coloured greene with eating of nettles and docks, and whaelse they could reare out of the ground.


Beside this, two most horrid
 spectacles were then s
ne three children (the eldest not above 10 yeares old all eat∣ing and grawing the intrals of their dead Mother, upon whose flesh they had fed 20 dayes past having devoured all the flesh to the bare bones; now fell a roasting the in
r
lles on a slow fire to sustaine themselves from starving.


Another more cruell discovered by Captaine 
Traver
 ly∣ing at the 
Newry,
 of certaine old women in those parts which used to make a fire in the fields, whether divers lit∣tle children drove out cattell in the cold mornings, and comming to warme themselves, were by these surprised, killed, and eaten, which at the last was discovered by a great girle which brake from them by strength.


For the certaine information the Captaine sent our fo
 Souldiers to try the truth of it, who found the 
o
ls and bones of children scattered in the fields; and so did appre∣hend those cursed cairiffs, and put them to death. Those and many as bad are the accidents that happened in that Rebellion.


And who can expect better in this, or 
 who 
 not worse, if no
 suddenly prevented, this fire of rebellion now kindle
; will be found to increase into a devouring 
 by slow and slender oppositions to the first cruption, if the






Rebels have liberty to combine and know their owne strength, for by delay the foe is incouraged, and his num∣ber animated by such as submit for feare of them, when they cannot be secured by us.


And if we have not such forces as may keepe and com∣mand the field, thereby to compell the Rebell to make re∣sistance
t one place with most of his forces, then will hee forrage and spoyle all abroid in the Country; but if hee be made unite in one head, then will he soone be driven to want of victuals, which will be apt to breed murmurings and mutinies among themselves.


And a warre of force will be great, costly, and large (as the Earle of 
Essex
 said) and that will make the burden more deservedly to be complained of, then that of Queene 
Elizabeth,
 who did grieve and groane (as shee sayd) with her subjects, under so great a weight as the maintaining of 1400. foot, and 1500 horse, in a climate full of contagion, in a Kingdome utterly wasted.


Which forces ours must farre exceed, for although the Rebels have not such woods and fortresses as then, yet now are they equall in number, and farre more ready then for∣merly, and better exercised in feats of armes, and no doubt will make the best advantage of the hils and boggs, for the Earle of 
Essex
 was wont to say that the warre in 
Ereland,
 was as aswell to be made with woods and bogges as men; It's not like the coursing of a Hare, but as the digging after an earthed Foxe from one angle to another.


It was then thought the savingst way to breake them by factions raysed among themselves, they being coveteous and mercenary; and will be hired to any thing, especially if the Iesuites and preaching Priests be but rooted out, which doe solder them so fast and close together, that were they quite banished; they would moulder asunder in short time of themselves.


Some obstructions were then like to happen, as ready to hinder the good progresse arising from the discountenan∣cing of the Generall by the supreame authority that im∣ployed him; his want of trusty friends to mediate and speed his proceedings; this feare raysed many jealousies in the Earle of 
Essex
 head, and run him on the rash attempt to have (unw
rranted) the Service.


This made Lord 
Mountjoy,
 so labour to ingratiate him∣selfe with Secretary 
Cecil,
 a man powerful with the Queen, by which meanes all necessaries are timely sent unto him, himselfe incouraged to diligence, and had in honour and reputation in the eyes of his Souldiers. It was the only o∣verthrow of victorious 
Haniball,
 to bee secretly maligned, by the crafty wiles of 
Hanno
 working upon some thrifty humours of the Senators of 
Carthage,
 and ready to urge all his proceeding to his disadvantage.


And when some shall labour by false evidence to sway the opinion of his Supreame judge in the title of their fa∣vour and his deserts; this dealing may prove injurious to the service by whomsoever to be undertaken.


It was then thought fit for the further countenancing of the Generall, for to leave the disposing of many places, e∣specially the Companies of the supplies sent unto him, for so Gentlemen were kept in 
Ireland
 from being troublesome in importuning authority for Companies in 
England,
 & men did more indeavour to deserve well being in the eye of him of whom they have, or else expect advancement, and by that meanes will he bee able to curbe the insolencies and misdemeanours, of many bad Captaines, who sue and presse hard for command to make a living, rather then out of any love to the cause or Countrey, or any affection to their Companies, as may appeare by keeping of them imperfect, and so lay the greater burden of service on the rest, or else


by changing away some for such such as are not seruicea∣ble, as was attempted in the first Scottish imployment and knowing that their time is short, and at the end of the war begins (through their wast and improuidence, their misery) Captaines make harvest wages by reaping other men corne.


These crimes in the Queenes wisdome were thought so heynous, as that the offenders were made examples by ca∣sheering, degrading, and other notes of infamy.


And Captaines refusing to shew their Companies, when they were required by the Commissaries of the Mustors should be checked two moneths pay, which will prove no ill president to be now obserued.


Another inconvenience then happened in that there were not large Magazins of provision layd in the safe Townes lying on the Sea or great Rivers, for an Army has a large body, and much of it (like a frogs belly) and without that satisfaction the hands and knees are feeble.


And through the default of the Victualers there happe∣ned as great a mischiefe, that seeing the state of 
England
 ex∣ceeds all other Princes in their large allowance both by Sea and Land. So for the kind more nourishable, as hoofe and porke, where as the Spaniard and French feed-on hard pease and beanes, dry ruske, and insiped rice, easie to bee kept indeed.


But through the coozenage and deceit of the victualers, it is both cut short in quantity, and unsavoury, and un∣wholsome in the quality breeding diseases and infection a∣mong the poor souldiers. This is no news to any that have been in the late actions of the English, and will never be o∣therwise untill some severe course be taken with these cruell Harpies that ruine both King and people by uttering any musty provision.


An excellent and commendable provision was then made for the sick; a Quest-house in the Towne, and carefully looked into, and to have their lendings in ready money, and surplussage allowed.


And for those that were sick or sickly in the Camp; their own means allowed them very duly.


Then a generall contribution from the Officers and Cap∣taines of the Army: amounting to fifty pound a week, be∣stowed in providing warm b
o
h, meat and lodging; as was a great succour both to the sick and 
aymed, not permit∣ting them to lye in the field scattered or neglected, as though by their losse of limbes or health, they had lost their Christianity, what is it that takes away the edge of their valour, that they dare not venture so boldly as they would, but this neglect and scorne that is offered them, or least the losse of a member prove more miserable then the losse of their lives.


But let us now goe on with better hopes, and resolutions becomming the English Nation, assuring 
selves there is now wealth and honour to be gotten as wel a
 then, when di
rs archieved the dignity of Earles, many Vis
o
ts, 13 at the least.


Barons which were Colonels and Captaines in that ser∣vice, besides many well affected Irish; who wonne honour and not b
ing can be w
ing 
C
s
r,
 a
d the 
 will take care of us.


Besides, know of what condition your adversaries are Rebels in the highest degree against God, so having woun∣ded their own conscience, and God their hearts; they will prove no other then a hea
 of Deere, shewing a faire head; but make their heele the safe Gardian off them; and those light-footed 
Kerne
 have alwayes made better use of their heels then hands; and proof hath shewed when


ever they were called to the aid of the 
Scots
 or 
English.


Whose best commendations was, that the 
Irish
 at the first went on well, but according to their custome suddenly fell off; and leave their party ingaged, if they looke not to it.


So they did in a good cause, and with good company, but now all stained, and stand guilty of Rebellion, which is as the sin of witchcraft.


They became crest-falne, faint-hearted, that if follow∣ed with speed, 
actum est.


The Tragedy is ended, they must all uncase.


But why am I so bold, when wisdome almost divine is busie about it?


As if I meant to light a candle to the Sun; why that has been at noon day, to pry a corner that glorious light stoops not too.


Besides, 
Abundans cautela non nocet.


Many boayes in the Sea, many beacons on the shoare, makes all the more safe and secure. And it may be used as an old wifes medicine, if it doe no good it will do no hurt: for it is not meant as an advice, but as an opinion of a wel∣wisher, which may be allowed or cancelled at any mans pleasure.




But when thou goest out with thy Host against thine enemies, keep thee then from all wickednesse, 
Deut. 23. 9.








FINIS.
