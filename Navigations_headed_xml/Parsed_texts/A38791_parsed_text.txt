TO THE
READER.


WHen I first chanced upon
this severe piece, and
read it in the Language it was sent
me, I was so much concern'd for the
honour of our Country, that it was
my resolution to suppress the Pub∣lication
of our shame, as conceiving
it an Act of great Inhumanity;
But upon second, and more impar∣tial
Thoughts, I have been tempted
to make it speak 
English,
 and
give it Liberty, not to reproach,
but to instruct our Nation, remem∣bring
what the Wise-Man hath
said, 
Open rebuke is better than


secret Love.
 Prov. 27. 5. The
truth is, I cannot say but the par∣ticulars,
are most of them, very
home; and which we may no way
evade, without acknowledging, at
least, that the Gentleman (whoever
he were) made notable use of his
time, but best of all, by setting
upon an effectual redress of what is
amiss. And though I doubt not,
but one might easily retort in as ma∣ny
instances, upon defects as great
(if not greater) of that Nation;
(for he that finds fault, had need
be perfect) yet were it then fittest
to do it, and to revenge this Cha∣ritable
Office, when we shall have
first reformed our selves.

A
JOURNEY
TO
ENGLAND, &c.


MY LORD,


YOU Command me to give
you a Minute account of
what I observed, and how I
passed that little time which
I lately spent in 
England;
 a Country,
whose 
Character
 you so greatly desire
to be informed of, in a Conjuncture
(as you rightly deduce) of strange Vi∣cissitude,
and indeed they are a Peo∣ple
of all the World most fond of alte∣rations;
And to whom, My 
Lord,

should I more readily submit? First,
encourag'd to make this excursion by


your Lordship, who had formerly be∣held,
and so much admir'd the Splen∣dor
and Magnificence of this 
Court,

and 
Kingdom
 in its greatest 
Acme
 and
Lustre. But, My 
Lord,
 I cannot
imagine, that you should esteem me
either of Years, or Capacity to in∣form

You,
 whose Judgment is so Ma∣ture,
and Correspondence so univer∣sal,
as that there is nothing which
can escape your Cognizance, not only
in that 
Island,
 but in all the VVorld
besides. But since you oblige me not
to dip into the Transactions of State,
the effects of Providence, Time, and
other Notices of a Superiour Orb;
and in which you cannot be instructed
by so weak an instrument as your
Servant; and demand only the little

Remarks
 of my hasty, and desultory

Peregrination;
 though I cannot pre∣tend
to improve your 
Lordship
's
Knowledge, yet I may hope to give
it diversion, and an 
Essay
 of my Obe∣dience.


It must be avowed that 
England
 is
a Sweet, and Fertil Country.


Terra potens armis, atque ubere gleba.



That the Fields,
 the Hills, and the Val∣lies
are perpetually clad with a glori∣ous,
and agreeable Verdure; that her
Provisions are plentiful; her Staples
important; and her interest very con∣siderable;
not omitting the most Beau∣tiful

Ladies,
 I had almost said, of the
VVorld,
 but for a just respect due to
the Illustrious 
Circles
 of our 
Court,

where the Beauties of Conversation,
so far transcend the tinctures of Lillies
and Roses. But these, My 
Lord,
 are
not the 
Memoirs
 which you demand;
I will therefore hasten to my 
Post.


After a short Passage from 
Calais,

we came on shore at 
Dover,
 where
the People of the Town entertain'd us
with such suspicious and forbidding
Countenances, whispering, and stiff
Postures, that I should never have
believed so great a difference in the Ad∣dresses
of two Nations, could have
been produced by so short a trajecti∣on,
and in a Port continually accu∣stom'd
to the Faces of Strangers, had
not the contrary humours of our con∣tiguous
Neighbours, the 
Spaniards,

made it possible, in so many pleasant


instances. But I was amazed, when
we had taken 
Post,
 and scarce out of
the 
Village,
 at the Acclamations of the

Boys,
 running after, and affrighting
our Horses, hooting, and crying
out, 
French Dogs, French Dogs, a
Monsieur, Monsieur!
 By a particular
expression of Welcome, which other
People would interpret Derision; But
in this Triumph (though somewhat
late e'er we set out of 
Dover
) we at∣tain'd
as far as 
Rochester
 the first night,
where, how new a thing it appear∣ed
to me, to see my confident 
Host

set him down cheek by joul by me,

belching, and puffing 
Tobacco
 in
my Face, you may easily imagine,
till I afterwards found it to be the u∣sual
stile of this Country; and that
the 
Gentlemen,
 who lodge at their

Inns,
 entertain themselves in their
Company, and are much pleas'd with
their impertinences: Arriv'd at the

Metropolis
 of civility, 
London,
 we put
our selves in 
Coach,
 with some Persons
of Quality, who came to conduct us
to our Lodging; but neither was this
passage without honours done to us,


the Kennel dirt, and roots being fa∣vours
which were frequently cast at
us by the Children, and Apprentices
without reproof; Civilities, that in

Paris,
 a 
Gentleman
 as seldom meets
withal, as with the contests of 
Car-Men,

who in this Town domineer in
the Streets, o'er-throw the 
Hell-Carts

(for so they name the 
Coaches
)
Cursing, and reviling at the 
Nobles:

You would imagine yourself amongst
a 
Legion
 of 
Devils,
 and in the suburb of

Hell.
 I have greatly wondered at the
remisness of the 
Magistrate,
 and the
temper of the 
Gentlemen,
 and that the

Citizens,
 who subsist only upon them,
should permit so great a disorder, rather
joining in the affronts, than at all cha∣stizing
the Inhumanity. But, these are
the natural effects of Parity, popular
Libertinism, and Insulary Manners.


I find, as you told me, My 
Lord,
London
 to be a Town so nobly Scitu∣ated,
and upon such a River,
 as 
Europe

certainly shews not one more useful
and agreeable; Their 
Fountains,
 which
are the Pride and Grace of our Streets,
and plentifully supplyed in this 
City,



are here immur'd, to secure the Wa∣ters
from, I know not what, impuri∣ties:
But certainly, it do's greatly de∣tract
from the beauty of the 
Carfours,

and intercepts the view.


Amongst the piece of 
Modern Archi∣tecture,

I have never observ'd above
two, which were Remarkable in this
vast, 
City.
 The Church of St. 
Paul
's,
and the Banqueting-House at 
White-Hall,

of which I remember to have
heard your 
Lordship
 speak: But you
would be amaz'd at the 
genius
 of
these People, that not much above for∣ty
Years ago should suffer this goodly
and venerable Fabrick, to be built a∣bout
and converted into raskally

Ware-Houses,
 and so sordidly obscur'd
and defac'd, that an argument of
great Avarice, Malice, Meanness, and
deformity of Mind, cannot possibly
be expressed: Nothing here of Or∣nament,
nothing of Magnificence, (on∣ly
a heavy piece of Architecture;) no
publick and honourable Works, such
as render our 
Paris,
 and other 
Cities

of 
France,
 renowned, and visited by
all the World; emulating even 
Italy



herself, for her 
Palaces,
 uniform and
conspicuous Structures: I assure your

Lordship,
 that 
England
 is the sole spot
in all the World, where among 
Christi∣ans

their 
Churches
 have been made
Jakes, and Stables, Markets and
Tipling-Houses; and where there
were more need of 
Scorpions,
 than

Thongs,
 to drive out the 
Publicans

and 
Money-Changers:
 In sum, where
these 
excellent
 uses, are pretended to
be the Marks of Piety and Reforma∣tion.
I had sometimes the curiosity
to visit the several 
Worships
 of these

Equivocal Christians,
 and 
Enthusiasts:

But I extreamly wondred to find
those whom they call 
Presbyterians,

and that would imitate us of the 
Re∣ligion

in 
France
 and 
Geneva,
 to have
their 
Discipline
 so confused and diffe∣rent.
In this 
remark,
 My Lord, to
be somewhat more particular, you
will not be displeas'd; because it
was a thing you so much recommend∣ed
to my especial Notice. 
Form,

they observe none; They pray and
read without method, and indeed,
without Reverence or Devotion; I


have beheld a whole Congregation
sit on their—with their Hats on, at
the reading of the 
Psalms,
 and yet
bare-headed when they sing them,
in divers places they read not the

Scriptures
 at all; but up into the 
Pul∣pit,

where they make an insipid, te∣dious
and immethodical 
Prayer,
 in
Phrases, and a tone so affected and
mysterious, that they give it the
name of 
Canting,
 a term by which
they do usually express the 
Gibbrish

of Beggars and Vagabonds; after
which, there follows the 
Sermon,

consisting (like their Prayers) of

Speculative
 and 
Abstracted
 Notions,
and things, which, nor the People,
nor themselves, well understand: But
these they extend to an extraordinary
length, and 
Pharisaical
 repetitions;
'till almost they sleep; I am sure, 'till
their Auditors do.


The 
Minister
 uses no Habit of
distinction, or gravity, but steps up
in 
querpo;
 and when he lays by his

Cloak
 (as I have observed some of
them) he has the action rather of a

Thrasher,
 than a 
Divine;
 this they


call 
taking pains,
 and indeed it is so, to
those that hear them: But thus they
have now encouraged every pert 
Me∣chanick

to invade, affront and out∣preach
them; and having cancel'd
all manner of decency, prostituted both
their Persons and Function to usurpa∣tion,
penury and derision. You may
well imagine by the manners of the
People, and their prodigious Opinions,
that there is no 
Catechisms,
 nor 
Sacra∣ments

duly Administred: 
The Religion
of
 England 
is Preaching, and sitting still
on Sundays.
 How they Baptize I
know not, because the Congregation
is dismissed, and they agree in no
form; and for the other 
Sacraments,

no Man gives, or receives alike: Such
of their Churches as I have frequented,
were damned up with 
Pues,
 every
three or four of the Inhabitants, sit∣ting
in narrow 
Pounds
 or 
Pulpits,
 by
themselves; for they are all turn'd

Preachers
 now, In short, there is
nothing more unlike to our reformed
Churches in 
France
 and I think in all

Europe
 beside; the apprehension of

Popery,
 or fondness to their own ima∣ginations,


having carry'd them so far
to the other extream, that they have
now lost all Moderation, and Deco∣rum;
And I have been herein, My
Lord, the more industrious to inform
my self of each particular; because it
seems yet to be as publick as the 
Reli∣gion

of the State. Some of their own
party, I have heard deplore this con∣fusion,
but certainly, they themselves
gave the first occasion to these Mon∣strous
Liberties, by a Rigid, and Un∣charitable
Discipline; primarily (it
seems) introduced by the 
Scots,
 and
so refined upon by these, as there are
few or none that will submit to the
Tyranny; but every one takes his
own course, and has protection for
it. Some well natur'd abused Men I
have met withal among them; but,
if I mistake not, for the greater Ingre∣dient,
Ambitious, Ignorant, Over∣weening,
Sower, and Uncharitable,

ne quid asperius,
 combining with the
interest of the times, and, who to
render themselves powerful, have in
compliances with the Spirital Pride of
the 
Mechanicks
 and Corporations, con∣niv'd


at those many, and prodigious

Schisms
 and 
Heresies
 which are now
spawn'd under themin such numbers,
as give terrour to the State. I omit
to tell your Lordship that few take
Notice of the 
Lord
's-Prayer; it is e∣steemed
a kind of weakness to use it,
but the 
Creed
 and the 
Decalogue
 are
not once heard of in their Congrega∣tions;
This is Milk for 
Babes,
 and
these are all 
Giants.
 They do fre∣quently
Solemnize their late 
National

deliverances, and some days of 
Chri∣stian
Bloodshed,
 with all possible exact∣ness.
But they think it gross 
Idolatry

to join with the whole 
Christian
Church
 of all Professions under Hea∣ven,
in the 
Anniversaries
 of our B.

Saviours Incarnation, Passion, Resur∣rection,

and descent of the 
Holy Ghost,

Spiritual, Eternal, and never to be
forgotten Mercies. Would your

Lordship
 believe that this madness
should advance so far, as to disturb
the 
French-Church
 there, which you
know, does in all places observe those
signal Deliverances and Blessings,
both by 
Preaching, Prayer, Sacra∣ments



and Exhortations, apposite to
to the Occasion; What think you
will be the issue of this goodly Refor∣mation?
I could tell you more of the
Mysterious 
Classis;
 their ridiculous,
insidiary, and presumptuous Questi∣ons;
their unheard of Animosities
against their Brethern of the 
Church
 of

England,
 suffering themselves to be ra∣ther
torn in sunder by the 
Sectaries,
Demotrius
 and the 
Crafts-Men,
 whilst
they contend about trifles and meer
shadows.


Concerning the 
Independents,
 all I
can learn is; They are a refined, and
Apostate sort of 
Presbyters;
 or, rather
such as renounces all Ordination, as who
having Preached promiscuously to the
People, and cunningly ensnared a Se∣lect
number of Rich, and ignorant
Proselytes, separate themselves into

Conventicles,
 which they name 
Con∣gregations.

There is nothing does
more resemble this 
Sect,
 than our
Rom. 
Missionaries
 sent out 
in partibus
Insidelium;
 for they take all other

Christians
 to be 
Heathens.
 These are
those great Pretenders to the 
Spirit,



into whose Party, does the vilest Per∣son
living, no sooner ascribe himself,
but he is, 
ipso facto,
 bubt a 
Saint,

hallow'd, and dear to 
God.
 These,
are the confidents, who can design
the 
minute,
 the 
place,
 and the 
means

of their Conversion: A 
Schism
 full of
Spiritual disdain, incharity, and high
imposture: But every alteration of

State,
 destroying the interest of the
versatile Contrivers, they are as rea∣dy
to 
Transmigrate
 into the next more
thriving Fraternity, as the 
souls
 of

Pythagoras
 into Beasts, and may then
perhaps, assume some other 
Title,

This is a sad, but serious truth, and
not a little menaces the common 
Chri∣stianity,

unless timely prevented. But,
Sir, I will not longer tire your pati∣ence
with these 
Monsters
 (the sub∣ject
of every contemptuous 
Pamphlet
)
nor with the madness of the 
Anabap∣tists,
Quakers,
) (which are increased to a
prodigious number) 
Fifth Monarchy-Men,

and a 
Cento
 of unheard of 
Here∣sies

besides, which, at present, de∣form
the once renowned 
Church of Eng∣land;

and approach so little the pre∣tended



Reformation,,
 which we in

France
 have been made to believe they
are arrived to.


But I have dwelt too long on this

remark,
 I return to the Town, where
they arc pestred with 
Hackney-Coach∣es,

and insolent 
Car-Men, Shops,
 and

Taverns, Noise,
 and such a cloud of
of 
Sea-Coals,
 that if there be a resem∣blance
of 
Hell
 upon Earth, it is in this

Vulcans
 in a Foggy Day:
 This pesti∣lent

Smoak
 so fatally seizes on the

Lungs
 of the Inhabitants, that the

Cough,
 and the Consumption spare no
Man. I have been in a spacious

Church,
 where I could not hear the

Minister
 for the Peoples Barking.


There is within this 
City,
 and in all
the Towns of 
England
 (which I
have passed through) so prodigious a
number of Houses where they sell a
certain Drink called 
Ale,
 that I think
a good half of the 
Inhabitants
 may be
Denominated 
Ale-House-Keepers,
 these
are a meaner sort of 
Cabarets:
 But
what is most deplorable, where some

Gentlemen
 sit (especially in the Coun∣try)
and spend much of their time;


drinking of a muddy kind of 
Beverage,

and 
Tobacco,
 which has, universally
besotted the 
Nation,
 and at which (I
hear) they have consumed many no∣ble
Estates.
 As for other 
Taverns,
London
 is Compos'd of them, where
they drink 
Spanish
 and 
Red-Wines,
 and
other Sophisticated Liquors to that
fury and intemperance, as has often
amaz'd me to consider it: But thus
some mean Fellow, the 
Drawer,
 ar∣rives
to an Estate, some of them ha∣ving
built fair Houses, and purchased
those 
Gentlemen
 out of their Posses∣sions,
who have ruined themselves by
that base and dishonourable Nice of
Ebriety: And that nothing may be
wanting to the height of Luxury and
Impiety of this 
Abomination,
 they
have translated the 
Organs
 out of the

Churches,
 to set them up in 
Taverns,

and even a worse sort of 
Tipling-Houses,

chanting their 
Dithyrambicks,

and bestial 
Bacchanalias,
 to the Tune
of those 
Instruments,
 which were
wont to assist them, in the Celebra∣tion
of 
God
's Praises, and regulate
the Voices of the worst Singers in the


World, which are the 
English
 in their

Churches
 at present; I cannot but
commend the 
Reformed
 in 
Holland,

who still retain their 
Organs
 in the

Churches,
 and make use of them at
the 
Psalms,
 without any Opinion of
Superstition; and I once remember to
have heard the Famous 
Diodati
 wish
they might be introduc'd even at

Geneva.
 A great error undoubtedly
in those who sit at the Helm, to per∣mit
this scandal; to suffer so many
of these 
Taverns
 and occasions of In∣temperance,

such Leaches, and Vi∣pers;
to gratifie so sordid and base
a sort of People with the spoils of
honest, and well Natur'd Men.
Your 
Lordship,
 will not believe me
that the 
Ladies
 of greatest Quality,
suffer themselves to be treated in one
of these 
Taverns,
 where a 
Curtesan
 in
other 
Cities
 would scarcely vouchsafe
to be entertained: But you will be
more astonish'd when I shall assure
you, that they drink their 
Crowned
Cups,
 and roundly, strain Healths
through their 
Smocks,
 Dance after
the Fiddle, Kiss freely, and term it an


honourable 
Treat.
 But all this my
Experience, particular address, and
habitudes with the greatest of that
Nation has assur'd me, that it is not
the pass time, only of the inferiour
and 
Meretricious
 sort;
 since I find it a
chief suppletory at all their Entertain∣ments,
to drink Excessively, and that
in their own Houses, before the 
La∣dies,

and the 
Lacques:
 It is the After∣noons
diversion; whether for want
of better to employ the time, or af∣fection
to the drink, I know not:
But I have found some Persons of
Quality, who one could not safely vi∣sit
after Dinner, without resolving to
undergo this 
Drink Ordel,
 and endure
the Question: It is esteem'd a piece
of Wit, to make a Man Drunk, for
which some swilling insiped 
Client,
 or

Congiarie,
 is a frequent and constant

adjutant,
 Your 
Lordship
 may hence
well imagine, how heavy, dull, and
insignificant the Conversation is;
loud, querillous, and impertinent.
I shall relate a story that once hap∣pened
in my presence, at a 
Gentleman
's
House in the 
Country,
 where there was


much Company and Feasting. I
chanced to come at Dinner-Time, and
after the Cloth was taken away (as
the manner is) they fell to their lauda∣ble
Exercise: But I unacquainted
then with their Custom, was lead up
into a 
With-Drawing-Room,
 where
I had the Permission (with a Noble
Person who introduced me) to sit and
converse with the 
Ladies,
 who were
thither retired; the 
Gentleman
 of the
House leaving us in the mean time,
to Entertain his Friends below: But
you may imagine how strangely I
was astonished; to see within an hour
after, one of the Company that had Di∣ned
there, entering into the Room all
bloody,
 and disorder'd, to fetch a
Sword which lay in one of the Win∣dows,
and three or four of his Com∣panions,
whom the Fumes of the
Wine had inspirited, pursuing, and
dragging him by the Hair, till in this
confusion, one of their Spurs engaged
into a Carpet, upon which stood a
a very fair 
Looking-Glass,
 and two
noble pieces of 
Porselain,
 drew all to
the ground, broke the 
Glass,
 and the



Vasas
 in pieces; and all this on such
an instant, that the 
Gentleman
 and my
self, had much ado to rescue the af∣frighted

Ladies
 from suffering in the
tumult; but at last we prevailed,
and brought them to terms, the quar∣rel
concerning an 
Health
 only, which
one of them would have shifted. I
don't remember, My 
Lord,
 ever to
have known (or very rarely) a

Health
 Drank in 
France,
 no not the

King
's; and if we say 
A vostre sante
Monsieur,
 it neither expects Pledge,
or Ceremony. 'Tis here so the Cu∣stom
to Drink to every one at the 
Ta∣ble,

that by the time a 
Gentleman
 has
done his Duty to the whole Compa∣ny,
he is ready to fall asleep, whereas
with us, we salute the whole 
Table

with a single Glass only. But, My

Lord,
 was not this, imagine you; an
admirable 
Scene
 and very Extraordi∣nary?
I confess, the 
Lady
 of the
House being much out of Counte∣nance
at what had happened, profered
to excuse this disorder, and I was as
ready to receive it, till several encoun∣ters
confirmed me, that they were but


too frequent, and that there was a
sort of perfect: 
Debauchees,
 who stile
themselves 
Hectors,
 that in their mad
and unheard of 
Revils,
 pierce their
Veins to quaff their own 
Blood,
 which
some of them have Drank to that ex∣cess,
that they died of the intempe∣rance;
These are a professed 
Atheisti∣cal

Order of 
Bravo
's compos'd for the
most of 
Cadets,
 who spending beyond
their 
Pensions,
 to supply their extrava∣gances,
practise now and then the
High-Way,
 where they sometimes
borrow, that which they often repay
at the 
Gibbet;
 an Ignominious Trade,
unheard of amongst our Gallant 
No∣bles;

however Fortune reduce them.
But I know not whether I might not
here Match these Valiant 
Hero
's with
an avowed Society of 
Ladies,
 and
some of them not of the meanest for
Birth (I even blush to recount it of
that Fair Sex,) who boast of making
all advantages at 
Play,
 and are be∣come
so Dextrous at it, that seldom
they make a sitting, without design
and Booty; For there is here, My

Lord,
 no such thing as Courtship, af∣ter


the decent mode of our 
Circles;

for either being mingled in a Room,
the 
Gentlemen
 separate from the Con∣versation
of the 
Ladies,
 to Drink, as
before I related; or else to Whisper
with one another at some Carner, or

Bay-Window,
 abandoning the 
Ladies
 to
Gossip by themselves, which is a Cu∣stom
so strange to a 
Gallant
 of our

Nation,
 as nothing appears more bar∣barous
and undecent; and this in ef∣fect:
must needs be the reason, that
these Beautiful Creatures want assu∣rance,
address, and the charming
Discourse of our Damoisels, which
are faculties so shining, and agreeable
in their Sex with us in 
France:
 And
in truth even the 
Gentlemen
 them∣selves,
are greatly defective as to this
particular, ill Courtiers, Unpliant,
Morose, and of Vulgar address; ge∣nerally,
not so polished, free, and
serene, as is universally found, even
amongst the most inferiour of our 
Na∣tion.

I am not ignorant that they
impute it to a certain levity m us;

but it is a mistake in them, and that
because they so hardly reform it, with∣out


some ridiculous affectation, as is
conspicuous in their several 
Modes
 and

Dresses,
 which they vary ten times
for our once; every one affecting
something particular; as having no
Standard at 
Court,
 which should give

Laws,
 and Countenance the Fashion.
The 
Women
 are much affected with

Gaudry,
 there being nothing more
frequent than to see an Ancient Lady
wear Colours, a thing which neither
Young, nor Old of either Sex do with
us, save in the Country, and the

Camp;
 but 
Widows
 at no time. And
yet reprove they us for these Exorbi∣tances;
but I have often disputed the
case: Either we do ill, or well; if
ill, why then do they 
ape us?
 if well,
why do they reproach us? The truth
is, they have no Moderation, and
are neither so lucky, nor frugal as our

Ladies
 are in these Sumptuary ex∣pences;
and whereof the 
Magistrates

takes so little Cognisance, that it is
not an easie matter to distingnish the

Lady
 from the 
Chamber-Maid;
 Ser∣vants
being suffered in this brave
Country, to go clad like their Mistres∣ses,


a thing neither decent, nor per∣mitted
in 
France,
 where they may
wear neither Lace, nor Silk.
I may not forget to acquaint your

Lordship,
 that though the 
Ladies,
 and
the 
Gentlemen
 are so shie of one ano∣ther,
yet when once they grow ac∣quainted,
it passes into expressions,
and compellations extreamly new to
our usages, and the stile of our Coun∣try:
Do but imagine how it would
become our 
Ladies,
 to call 
Monsieur

N— 
Jack
 N. what more frequent
than this? 
Tom.
 P— was here to
Day; I went Yesterday to the
 
Cours

with 
Will.
 R— 
Henry
 M— treated
me at such a 
Travern;
 These are the
particular 
Idioms,
 and graceful Confi∣dences
now in use; introduced I con∣ceive
at first by some 
Camerades
 one
with another; but it is mean and
rude, and such as our 
Lacques,
 would
almost disdain in 
Paris;
 where I
have often observed two 
Chimny-Sweepers,

accost one another, in 
better Forms,

and Civiller Addresses. But
to be confident and civil, is not a thing


so easily understood, and, seems a
peculiar talent of our Nation.


However the 
Ladies
 are not more
obliging and Familiar, than the

Lords
 are difficult and inaccessable;

for though by reason of my Birth, and
Quality, my recommendations and
addresses, I found some tolerable re∣ception
amongst them; yet I observ'd,
that they kept at such a surly distance
with the 
Gentlemen,
 even of Family,
that methought I never beheld a ru∣der
Conversation; especially, when
comparing their Parts, and Educati∣ons,
I found them generally so much
inferiour, as if a 
Lord
 were indeed o∣ther
than a 
Gentleman;
 or a 
Gentle∣man
's
not fit Companion for a 
King:

But this must needs be the result of an
ill, and haughty institution, and for
that most of these great Persons are in
their Minority, and the Age wherein
they should be furnished with the
noblest impressions, taught only to
converse with their Servants, some

Sycophants,
 and under the Regiment
of a 
Pedant,
 which imprints that
scornfulness and folly, and fits them


with no better forms when they
should produce themselves, and give
testimony to others, as well of their
Superiority in Virtue, as in Birth,
and Dignity. But this is, My 
Lord,

a particular, which I have heard you
often complain of, and which we do
frequently take notice of, at their
coming abroad into our Country;
where for want of address, and fit
Persons to introduce them, they sel∣dom
return more refined than they
came, else they could not but have
observ'd, that there is nothing which
makes the distinction of 
Nobles
 in

France,
 but the 
Title,
 and that his

Majesty
 himself does them the ho∣nours,
which here they usurp upon
their equals; But, My 
Lord,
 they
are sufficiently punished for it in 
Eng∣land:

Where, to me they appear so
degenerate, for want of this humility
and free Conversation; by which,
and their other Vices, they grow now
so much despised, that the 
Gentlemen

need seek no Revenge: For though
(as I told you) the 
Gentlemen
 are
most of them very intemperate, yet


the 
Proverb
 goes,
 
As Drunk as a Lord.

But, My 
Lord,
 as there is no rule so
general, but it does admit of excepti∣ons,
so should I give my own Expe∣rience,
as well as your 
Lordships
 the
contradiction, to make the Censure
Universal; there being even amongst

these,
 some 
few,
 and in particular my

L. P.
 my 
L. M.
 my 
L. D.
 &c.
whom I esteem to be very noble, and
accomplished Persons, as who have
learned (by the good Fortune of a bet∣ter
Education) how to value the
Conversations of worthy Men, and
who indeed, do sufficiently verefie
all those 
Attributes
 which are due to
their Qualities, and therefore whom
this 
Paragraph
 does no ways con∣cern.


Nor should I be less severe and un∣just,
totally to exclude even some of
the 
Ladies
 from the Advantages of
this 
Period,
 whose perfections and Vir∣tues,
claim an equal right to all that
I have here spoken, out of a due re∣sentment
of their Merits and Excel∣llencies.



It was frequently,
 during the last

Winter,
 that I was carried to their

Balls,
 as where indeed, I expected to
see what should appear the most of
Gallant, and Splendid amongst the

Ladies,
 nor really did my expectations
deceive me; for there was a confluence
of very great Beauties, to which the
glistering of their Jewels (which up∣on
this occasion they want not) could
add nothing save their 
Weight;
 the
various Habits being so particular, as
if by some strange 
Inchantment,
 they
had encountered, and come out of se∣veral
Nations: But I was astonish'd
to see, when they were ready to move,
that a 
Dancing-Master,
 had the bold∣ness
to take forth the greatest 
Ladies,

and they again the 
Dancing-Master,

who performed the most part of the

Ball,
 whilst the 
Gentlemen,
 that were
present, were the least concerned, and
stood looking on; so as it appeared
to me more like the 
Farce
 of a 
Comedy,

than a 
Ball
 of the 
Nobles,
 and in truth,
their measures, when any of them
were taken out, made me some
what asham'd to lead a 
Lady
 who did


me the honour, for fear (though my
skill is very vulgar in that exercise)
they should have taken 
me
 for a 
Dan∣cing-Master,

as who had happily im∣ploy'd
my Youth so ill, as to have
some advantage of the rest in that
faculty. This favour is particular to
the 
Dancing-Masters
 in this Country;
and Reason good; for they have such
ample 
Salaries,
 as maintains both their
Prodigality, and an Insolence, that
were insupportable in 
France,
 where
these trifling Fellows do better know
themselves, are worse payed, and
less Presumptuous. Nay, so remiss
are the 
Ladies,
 of their respect in this
instance, that they not only entertain
all this; but permit themselves like∣wise
to be invited, and often honour
these impertinent 
Fantasticks,
 by
receiving the 
Ball
 at their Petty

Schools.


When this Ceremony was ended,
some of the 
Gallants
 fell to other 
Re∣creations,

and as far as I understood,
were Offering at that Innocent, yet
Salt,
 and Pleasant diversion, which in

France
 is called 
Rallery;
 but so far


were they from maintaining it within
the decencies, and Laws, which both
in 
that,
 and our 
Characters
 we ob∣serve
that in a little time, they fell
so upon personal abusing one ano∣ther,
that there was much ado to pre∣serve
the Peace, and as I heard, it was
the next Day, the product of a Quar∣rel,
and a 
Duel.


I did frequently in the Spring, Ac∣company
My Lord 
N.
 into a Field,

near the Town, which they call 
Hide-Park;

the place not unplesant, and
which they use, as our 
Course;
 but
not with that Order, Equipage, and
Splendor; there being an Assembly
of such wretched 
Jades,
 and 
Hackney-Coaches,

as quite takes away the re∣semblance.


The next place to be remembred
is the 
Spring-Garden,
 so called, and in
order to the 
Park,
 as our 
Thuilleries

is to the 
Course,
 the inclosure not dis∣agreeable,
for the solemness of the

Grove,
 the warbling of the Birds;
but the Company Walk in it at such
a rate, as you would think all the

Ladies
 were so many 
Atalanta
's, con∣tending


with their 
Wooers;
 and my

Lord,
 there was no appearance, that
I should prove the 
Hippomenes,
 who
could with very much ado, keep pace
with them: But as fast as they run;
they stay there so long, as if they
wanted not time to finish the 
Race;

for it is usual 
here
 to find some of the
Young Company till midnight; and
the Thickets of the 
Garden
 seem to be
contrived to all Advantages of 
Gallan∣try,

after they have been refreshed
with the 
Collation,
 which is here sel∣dom
omitted, at a certain 
Cabaret
 in the
middle of this 
Paradise;
 where the
forbidden Fruits are certain trifling

Tarts, Neats-Tongues, Salacious-Meats,

and bad 
Rhenish;
 for which the 
Gal∣lants

pay sauce, as indeed they do at
all such Houses throughout 
England;

for they think it is a piece of Frugali∣ty
beneath them, to Bargain, or Ac∣compt,
for what they Eat in any place,
however unreasonably imposed upon;
But thus, those mean Fellows are (as
I told your 
Lordship
) inriched; Beg∣ger,
and insult over the 
Gentlemen.

I am assur'd that this particular 
Host.



Has purchased, within few Years,
5000 
Livers
 of annual rent; and well
he may? at the rates these 
Prodigials

pay, whereas, in 
France,
 a 
Gentle∣man

esteems it no Diminution to Ma∣nage
even these expences with Rea∣son.
But, My 
Lord,
 it is now late,
and time to quit this 
Garden,
 and to
tell you, that I think there is not a
more Illustrious sight in the World,
than to meet the 
Divinities
 of our

Court,
 marching up the long Walk in
the 
Thuilleries,
 where the pace is so
stay'd and grave, the encounters so
regular and decent; and where those
who feed their Eyes with their Beau∣ties,
and their Ears with the Charm∣ing

Accent
 of their Discourse, and
Voices, need not those refreshments
of the other 
Senses,
 finding them
all to be so taken up with these.


I was curious before my return,
 and
when I had Conquer'd some difficul∣ties
of the 
Language,
 and 
Customs,
 to
visit their Judicatures, where, be∣sides,
that few of their 
Gownmen,

are to be compared to those of the

Robe
 in our 
Palais
 for Elocution, and


the talent of well speaking; so nei∣ther
do they at all exceed them, in the
forms and colours of their 
Pleading;
 but (as before I spake of their 
Ralle∣ry
)
supply the defects of the 
Cause,

with flat, insipid, and grosly abusing
one another; a thing to trifling,
and misbecoming the gravity of 
Courts

(where the 
Lawyers
 take Liberty to
Jest Mens Estates away, and yet
avow their Avarice) that I have
much admired at the temper of the
Judges, and their remissness in re∣forming
it: There was a Young Per∣son,
whom at my being there, was
very much cried up for his Abilities,
and in whom I did not observe that
usual intemperance, which I but now
reproved; and certainly, it springs
either for want of those Abilities,
which the 
Municipal
 Laws of this 
Na∣tion

(consisting most of them in 
Cu∣stoms

like our 
Normandy,
 whose An∣cient

Dialect
 their Books yet retain)
are so little apt to furnish; or the de∣fect
of those advantages, which the
more pollished 
Sciences
 afford us, with∣out
which, it is impossible to be good


Orators, and to maintain their Discour∣ses
without diversion, to that vile
nency.


But, what is infinitely agreeable in
this Country,
 are the 
Bowling-Greens,

and the 
Races,
 which are really such
pleasures abroad, as we have nothing
approaching them in 
France,
 and
which I was extreamly delighted in;
but the 
Verdure
 of the 
Country,
 and
delicious 
Downs,
 are what gives them
this preheminence, and indeed, they
are to be valued, and do in m
 esteem,
very much commute for the loss of
that glorious 
Planet,
 which ripens our

Vines
 in 
France.


The 
Horses,
 and the 
Dogs,
 their
incomparable 
Parks,
 of 
Fallow-deer,

and Laws of 
Chase,
 I extreamly ap∣prove
of; but upon other occasions,
all 
Englishmen
 ride so fast upon the

Road,
 that you would swear there
were some Enemy in the 
Ariere;
 and
all the 
Coaches
 in 
London
 seem to
drive for 
Mid-Wives.


But what did much more afflict me,


is their Ceremony at 
Table,
 where e∣very
Man is obliged to sit till all have
done Eating, however, their Appe∣tites
differ, and to see the formality
of the 
Voider,
 which our 
With-Draw∣ing-Rooms

in 
France
 are made to pre∣vent,
and might so here, if they
knew the use of them, to be, that e∣very
Man may rise when he has din'd,
without the least indecency, and leave
the 
Servers
 to their Office.


I have now but a Word to add,
and 
 is the tediousness of 
Visits,

which they ma
 
here
 so long, that it
is a very Tyra
y, to sit to so little
purpose: If the Persons be 
Ladies,

that are strangers,
 it is to look upon
each other, as if they had never seen
any of their own 
Kind
 before, and hand here
indeed the 
Virtue
 of their 
Sex
 is Emi∣nent.
For they are as silent and fixt
as 
Statues;
 or if they do talk, it is
with Censure, and sufficient confi∣dence:
So difficult it is, to 
Entertain

with a grace, or to observe a Medio∣crity.



In sum, My 
Lord,
 I found so many

particulars,
 worthy of reproof in all
those 
Remarks,
 which I have been
able to make, That to render you a
veritable account of 
England,
 as it is
at present, I must pronounce, with
the 
Poet.


Difficile est
 Satyram 
non scribere.

And shall defer what I have fur∣ther
to add till the return of my Lord
Ambassador.


FINIS.
